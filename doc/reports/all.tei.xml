<p>The study consisted of a retrospective analysis of 200 mobile 
digital AP chest X-rays (stored on phosphor plates) carried out on 
20 preterm neonates at two different hospitals, including patients 
with multiple X-rays (performed on separate occasions). One hun-
dred images were acquired from a university hospital (site 1) and 
another 100 images were obtain from a community teaching hos-
pital (site 2). We extracted demographical data from the case notes, 
including the length of gestation (weeks) and the age of the neonate 
on the date of the X-ray. Tube settings and exposure parame-
ters, including tube voltage, tube current and dose-area product 
(DAP) were recorded. The radiography systems used were a Philips 
Mobile Diagnost (Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) at site 1, 
and a Siemens Mobilette (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at site 2. 
The radiographers were noted, as well as their years of experi-
ence in performing X-rays. In addition, we recorded the presence 
of tubes and catheters as a surrogate of disease severity. The data 
were anonymised before image evaluation. Radiographs used for 
the study were included sequentially and not preselected. We did 
not take the diagnosis into account. Both hospitals monitored the 
rate of repeat X-rays. Repeat images on neonates were not allowed 
without the permission of a consultant radiologist. All procedures 
performed in studies involving human participants were in accor-
dance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national 
research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its 
later amendments or comparable ethical standards. For this type 
of study formal consent was not required. Informed consent was 
obtained from all individual participants included in the study. 
Two experienced radiologists (JCS and IK-S) evaluated the image 
quality, based on the exposure of non-thoracic structures. They 
determined the most superior and inferior parts of the body, as 
well as the lateral structures, which had been included within 
the boundaries of collimation on each chest X-ray. The readers 
performed their evaluations according to the European Guide-
lines on Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images in 
Paediatrics [12]. A grading system was used to measure image 
quality in terms of correct collimation. Inappropriate exposure of 
abdominal viscera was assumed when the caudal imaging field 
extended below the level of L1/2 (1 point). Exposure of the cra-
nial structures was considered inappropriate when the collimated 
field included more than the tip of the mandible (1 point). Inap-
propriate exposure of the arms was assumed when more than the 
diametaphyseal junction of the proximal humerus came within 
the field of view: part of the diaphyseal humerus (1 point); entire 
humerus (2 points); part of the forearm (1 point); entire forearm 
(2 points); hand (1 point). The maximum score was 12 points. The 
image quality in terms of correct collimation was graded arbitrar-
ily as follows: 0 points = optimal image quality; 1-2 points = slightly 
reduced; 3-4 = moderately reduced; 5-6 = markedly reduced; and 
&gt;7 points = severely reduced (Fig. 1). Rotation and tilting were also 
recorded. Radiographic errors were recorded on individual tick 
sheets and the information was captured in an <rs id="software-0" type="software">Excel</rs> spreadsheet 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft</rs>, Redmond, WA). The readers resolved any differences by 
consensus. 
The exposure of non-thoracic structures was correlated with 
factors potentially influencing image quality. The chi 2 test (uncor-</p>

<p>rected for continuity) was used to calculate differences between the 
hospitals, as well as between optimal and suboptimal images with 
respect to age, gestation, number of tubes and catheters, radiog-
rapher, and the number of years' experience. Student's t test was 
used to calculate differences between DAPs. The Spearman rank 
correlation coefficient was used to analyse the correlation between 
the radiographer's experience in performing X-rays and collimation 
quality. A level of p &lt; 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

<p>Statistical analysis. Differences between groups were 
compared using analysis of variance, and the least significant

<p>Statistical Analysis 
The mean and standard deviation of pa-
tient's age, disease and follow up duration, 
in addition to pre-and post-operative 
BFMDS scores were calculated. According 
to the normal distribution of data, the 
paired t-test was used to compare changes 
of the BFMDS before and after surgery.

<p>The past decade has seen an increasing appreci-
ation of the role of Information and Communi-
cations Technologies (ICT) in modernizing 
healthcare systems. Central to the 'eHealth' 
vision espoused by many governments is the 
promise of networked ICT (internet and mobile) 
to help engage citizens as partners in healthcare, 
chiefly through increasing the accessibility of rel-
evant information and services. 
1 This reflects a 
growing emphasis, in many Western nations, on 
patient-centred healthcare models and comp-
lements wider citizen-centric policy initiatives 
around public engagement, freedom of infor-
mation and civic transparency. 
Electronic Health Records (EHR) represent the 
central pillar of eHealth strategies worldwide, 
since they offer the capacity to support patient 
care, quality improvement, population health 
surveillance and research. 
2 Until recently the 
topics of <rs type="software">EHR</rs> and 'Consumer Health Infor-
matics' tended to be considered separately; dis-
cussions of the former being mainly centred on 
healthcare institutions. Across North America 
and Europe there has been a gradual realization 
of the synergies between these two areas, mani-
fested in the growing attention that is being 
paid to Personal Health Records (PHR) in both 
the scientific and policy literatures. The PHR is 
a complex construct and many have bemoaned 
the lack of consensus on its precise definition. </p>

<p>The idea of patients accessing their own health 
records is not a new one. 
8 However, the accessibil-
ity afforded by the Internet, and the capacity of 
emerging PHR to integrate personal health appli-
cations with provider-owned record systems, 
creates interesting new challenges and research 
questions. 
The more complex and interactive models of 
PHR have yet to penetrate the UK market, in con-
trast to the US, where many healthcare manage-
ment organizations are providing such services, 
although 'patient portals' 
i are beginning to feature 
in NHS programmes 
9 This may reflect differences 
in the organization of healthcare services. In the 
UK the established role of the GP as the manager 
and integrator of patient-specific health infor-
mation removes the imperative for patients them-
selves to undertake this role, as can be the case in 
more disaggregated, multi-provider, health 
economies. 
ii Reflecting this history, the origins of 
the PHR movement in the UK lie with a small 
number of enthusiastic GPs who pioneered record 
sharing with patients using computer printouts 
and portable downloads, latterly partnering with 
GP systems suppliers to provide waiting-room 
kiosks and online portals. 
10 This has yielded 
favourable user responses and positive impacts 
on knowledge, mutual trust and record accuracy, 
despite some concerns over security and confiden-
tiality 
11,12,13 This ground-up approach sits in stark 
contrast to the top-down one used to introduce 
patient access to the NHS Summary Care Record 
via '<rs type="software">HealthSpace</rs>', which has so far met with 
limited success. </p>

<p>Figure 4. E2F transcriptional activation and 
Dp loss are highly similar, except for specific 
genes that require E2F activity for expression 
after exit. Using microarrays, we compared 
gene expression in E2F1-DP-expressing wings 
(ap-Gal4/UAS-E2F1, UAS-DP, tub-Gal80 
TS ) 
with controls (ap-Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 
TS ) 
and Dp mutant wings (w;Dp

trols (w) at three time points. (A) Heat map

of 1.5 or more (&gt;log 2 ± 0.6) at one or more 
time points are shown. Gray bars indicate 
transcripts that were removed from analysis 
because of high variability among indepen-
dently replicated experiments (n = 4 for E2F; 
n = 3 for Dp 
/ ). Transcripts were clustered 
using <rs type="software">Genesis</rs> software for hierarchical clus-
tering. Representative genes from each major 
cluster are listed on the right. Typical group 
transcripts are up-regulated in E2F-expressing 
and Dp

whereas other transcripts are repressed or in-
versely regulated. Arrays for E2F and Dp </p>

<p>) with controls (w) during proliferation (third 
larval instar [L3]), at normal exit (24 h APF), and after pro-
longed exit when E2F no longer promotes cycling (36 h APF). 
Fig. 4 shows the hierarchically clustered heat maps of transcript 
changes (log 2 ratio of expression compared with controls) for 
all transcripts with a fold change of 1.5 or more (&gt;log 2 ± 0.6) at 
one or more time points. Gray bars indicate transcripts that were 
removed from the analysis because of high variability among 
replicates (Fig. 4 A). The complete dataset is available as tab-
delimited text in the online supplemental material as a txt file, 
additional array data descriptions can be found in Materials and 
methods, and complete clusters can be viewed in high resolu-
tion on the <rs type="software">JCB DataViewer</rs>. 
Overall, transcript changes caused by E2F1-DP (E2F) 
overexpression and Dp loss were strikingly similar in terminally 
differentiating cells. When arrays were compared, a correlation 
coefficient of 0.74 was found for E2F and Dp 
/ arrays at 24 and 
36 h APF. Representative genes from each major cluster are listed 
in Fig. 4. The largest cluster consists of what we call typical tran-
scripts, which represent many known E2F target genes, that are 
up-regulated in both E2F-expressing and Dp 
/ wings at 24 and 
36 h APF. This group contains most of the 157 genes identified as 
Drosophila E2F targets in proliferating S2 cells by Dimova et al. 
(2003). This even includes genes in groups B and C from that 
study, which were unaffected by Dp loss in S2 cells (Dimova 
et al., 2003) but we find to be affected by Dp loss in wings in vivo. 
We also identified many additional E2F targets corroborated by 
other model system studies (for review see Bracken et al., 2004). 
Typical group transcripts were enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) 
terms involved in cell cycle (P &lt; 6.84 
9 ), DNA replication and 
repair (P &lt; 2.56 
8 ), microtubule cytoskeleton organization 
(P &lt; 2.14 </p>

<p>and E2F + Fzr 
RNAi clones contained as many as 10-16 cells/ 
clone (Fig. 5 J, right), indicating that multiple rounds of com-
plete extra cell cycles occurred with normal adult wing cuticle 
differentiation. This finding was consistent with our observation 
that E2F + Rca1 expression also increased the frequency of larger 
clones in the wing (Fig. S2 D). 
We hypothesized that high APC/C activity after exit could 
limit E2F-induced bypass of cell cycle exit by degrading key 
E2F targets. This is consistent with our finding that E2F1-DP-
overexpressing cells do not accumulate the known APC/C targets 
CycA, Geminin (Gem; Zielke et al., 2008), CycB, or Stg (based 
on a Stg-GFP fusion protein) after prolonged exit in wings or 
eyes (40-44 h APF; Fig. 6, A, C, E, and G; and Fig. S3), despite 
expressing high levels of cycA, gem, stg, and cycB transcripts by 
microarray (see supplemental dataset and <rs type="software">JCB DataViewer</rs>). 
In contrast, cells expressing E2F + Rca1 together accumulated 
CycA in wings (Fig. 6 B), Stg-GFP in eyes (Fig. 6 D), Gem in 
eyes (Fig. 6 H), and very low levels of CycB in wings and eyes 
(Fig. 6 F and Fig. S3). 
In contrast to other cyclins, E2F activity is able to induce 
CycE protein accumulation after prolonged exit (Buttitta et al., 
2007) because CycE is not a target for degradation by the APC/C. 
CycE activity is thought to inhibit the APC/C (Sigrist and 
Lehner, 1997; Reber et al., 2006). Therefore, an increase in 
APC/C levels could raise the CycE threshold after exit by re-
quiring increased CycE for complete APC/C inhibition. Consis-
tent with this, we found that cells overexpressing high levels 
of CycE-Cdk2 accumulated APC/C targets such as Gem and 
CycA after exit (Fig. 6, I and J). 
We suggest that high APC/C activity after exit raises the 
threshold of CycE and Stg required for cell cycle reentry of dif-
ferentiated cells. This appears to be increased even further by 
aberrant E2F activity in differentiated cells by increasing the ex-
pression of several core components as well as inducing expres-
sion of the activator fzy. This could explain why the increased 
CycE expression provided by high E2F activity alone is insuffi-
cient to bypass cell cycle exit after terminal differentiation. </p>

<p>Histology 
Pupae, staged from white prepupae (0 h) at 25°C, were dissected and 
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min at room tempera-
ture. Pupal cuticle was removed from wings after fixation. Tissues 24-36 h 
APF were blocked in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 + 1% BSA for 1 h. Tissues 
36-44 h APF were blocked in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 + 1% BSA (PAT) 
overnight. For stages after 44 h APF, we incorporated a methanol dehydra-
tion series after fixation (25, 50, 75, and 100% methanol/1× PBS, 10 min 
each) that allowed improved antibody penetration, increased sensitivity, 
and BrdU detection for tissues 44-60 h APF. After step-wise rehydration, 
tissues were blocked in PAT overnight, and antibody staining or BrdU incor-
poration was performed as described previously (Buttitta et al., 2007; 
Zielke et al., 2008) using Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 568-or Alexa 
Fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibodies and Vectashield mounting 
medium (Vector Laboratories). Wing hinge and notum as well as head 
capsule and antenna were excluded from our analyses. 1 µg/ml Hoechst 
33258 (Invitrogen) was used to label nuclei. Confocal sections and differ-
ential interference contrast images were collected on a microscope (LSM 
510; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 25× objective. Single representative sections 
(2.2 µm) are shown, except for Fig. 3 (E and F), which are projections of 
eight sections at a 1-µm interval. Images were cropped using <rs id="software-9" type="software">Photoshop</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Adobe</rs>). Mitotic index was calculated as the mean number of PH3-positive 
cells/100 GFP-positive cells among multiple clones in several samples, 
counted blind, from at least two independent experiments. </p>

Additional description of microarray data. In addition to the analysis 
provided in the results section, we also examined the other clusters of tran-
scripts affected by E2F activity in the wing. The second largest cluster of 
coregulated genes in E2F-overexpressing and Dp mutant wings was re-
pressed in differentiating cells. Because E2F1-DP is thought to act as a 
transcriptional activator, this group of repressed genes is somewhat un-
expected. These genes are not repressed indirectly by a delay in cell cycle 
exit, as they are similarly repressed in Dp mutants, which exit normally. We 
also do not believe that this group is caused by E2F1-DP repressive com-
plexes blocking transcription, as such targets would be expected to in-
crease rather than decrease in Dp mutants. One possibility suggested by 
Bracken et al. (2004) is that the extensive transcriptional up-regulation 
caused by E2F (or in Dp mutants) could cause some spurious antisense reg-
ulation of genes. Although we have not investigated this possibility, &gt;0% of 
the transcriptional changes we observed in both genotypes are indeed in-
creases in transcript levels. Overall, this group of repressed transcripts 
is significantly enriched for genes involved in monooxygenase activity 
(caused by six cytochromeP450 genes; P &lt; 8.08 
4 ) and genes with cat-
alytic activity (P &lt; 5.85 
4 ), suggesting some functional significance for 
this group. 
We were surprised to find that most transcripts were not affected by 
E2F overexpression or Dp loss at the proliferative L3 time point. This may be 
because E2F target gene expression is already high in controls during prolif-
eration, as evident by the high activity of the E2F reporter construct (PCNA-
GFP) and high levels of E2F target gene expression at this stage (Thacker 
et al., 2003). This is also supported by our finding that the few transcripts 
up-regulated by E2F and/or Dp loss at L3 are normally at low abundance in 
wings and were significantly (P &lt; 0.009) enriched for genes with expression 
one standard deviation lower than the mean gene expression. These tran-
scripts were also enriched for genes identified as group D or E germline/ 
differentiation genes specifically regulated by E2F2 in Dimova et al. (2003), 
which we find to be ectopically induced in nongermline tissues by E2F over-
expression and Dp loss (examples include spn-E, nanos, BthD, CG6790, 
CG8316, and CG7628). Thus, the transcriptional activation of E2F targets 
at proliferative stages seems to be masked by the high levels of E2F activity 
already present in the controls. Interestingly, this also suggests that normal 
levels of E2F targets are somehow maintained in an E2F-DP-independent 
manner in proliferating Dp mutant cells. </p>

<p>7 There are ten NHS Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) in England; each represents a different region of 
the country. SHAs are responsible for implementing the policy that is set by the Department of Health and 
managing local health care provision. Increasingly, over the period we study, policy making has been devolved 
to local SHAs. 
8 In addition, our data includes information on NHS funded patients who received elective surgery from 
privately owned providers. However, as it has been well documented, HES data has poor coverage of care 
delivered in private settings. This does not present a problem for our analysis, since during our period of 
analysis, private providers accounted for less than 3% of total NHS volume. Approximately 5% of our sample 
received elective surgery in privately owned facilities. In addition, consistent with other research (Gaynor 
et al., 2010; Propper and van Reenen, 2010), and NHS data cleaning rules, we limit our analysis to providers 
who treat over 99 AMIs per year.

<p>Introduction: Medical advances have improved life expectancy and survival of 
patients with thalassemia. However, as getting older, patients with thalassemia 
experience different complications which impair their quality of life. The aim of this 
study was to examine the effects of a nurse-implemented orientation program on 
quality of life in patients with thalassemia. 
Methods: A convenience sample of 55 patients with thalassemia were recruited in this 
quasi-experimental study. Patients were randomly allocated to control or experimental 
groups. A demographic questionnaire, Thalassemia quality of life questionnaire, and 
36-item short form health survey were used for data collection before and one month 
after the intervention. In the intervention group, 1.5-month orientation program 
including of the three steps of inauguration, implementation, and closure was 
implemented, while the control group received routine care. The Chi-square, 
independent t-test and paired-samples t-test were used for data analysis by using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> 
ver.<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">13</rs> software. 
Results: The intervention and control group did not differ significantly from each other 
regarding demographic characteristics. Moreover, no significant difference was 
observed between the two groups regarding the quality of life scores after the 
implementation of orientation program. 
Conclusion: Implementing a short-term orientation program was not effective in 
enhancing the quality of life in patients with thalassemia; hence, developing long-term 
multimodal strategies may result in better improvement. </p>

<p>session and they were provided with a written 
pamphlet containing a summary of the 
presented materials. At the end of the last 
session, we provided a comprehensive booklet 
to the patients which contained all contents of 
our educations. In the final closure step which 
was taken two weeks after the second step, we 
overviewed 
educations, 
acknowledged 
patients' participation in the study, and 
introduced useful educational websites, books, 
and articles for obtaining complementary 
information 
regarding 
thalassemia. 
In 
addition, we re-assessed patients' educational 
needs by using a self-administered checklist. 
Unfulfilled needs were identified and 
patients with unfulfilled needs were re-
educated individually. One month after the 
closure step, patients were invited to re-
complete the questionnaires. 
Data were analyzed by performing the Chi-
square, and the paired and independent 
samples t-tests by using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> Ver. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">13</rs> 
software. 
This study was approved by ethical 
committee of Tarbiat Modares University, 
Tehran, Iran (No: 52.5367). All participants had 
right to voluntarily participate in the study or 
withdraw from it. Moreover, they were 
informed that their information will remain 
confidential. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all samples. At the end of the 
study, patients in the control group were also 
received all contents of educations .Limitation 
of this study was the short time intervention. 
Further studies are suggested to be conducted 
in this patients of longer time at younger ages. </p>

<p>An intermediate solution between open and closed wikis 
has been adopted by some of the wiki databases that are 
published in this issue. In this model, although the wiki is 
closed there is a relatively low barrier to being accepted as 
an editor. In the 'vampire' model adopted by GONUTS 
(4) and EcoliWiki (5) any registered user can create new 
user accounts for their colleagues. Thus, the burden of 
maintaining the editor list is shared among all editors. 
There are 11 different articles in this Database Issue of 
NAR that describe the use of wikis as all or part of the 
database, listed in Table 1. Despite the use of different 
wiki implementations and the varied data that are being 
annotated, those articles reporting numbers of wiki edits 
are typically reporting thousands of edits per year (3-5,6). 
These numbers are consistent with those that we have 
observed (2). 
Interestingly, both resources that utilise Wikipedia 
describe independently developed quality control proced-
ures for Wikipedia articles. Pfam (and Rfam) uses the 
Wikipedia API to track new edits and present them to 
the biocurators for approval to ensure that the changes 
to the article are appropriate, before the article is dis-
played on the database website (7). The authors of the 
GeneWiki project have developed the <rs type="software">WikiTrust</rs> 
resource (3), which works via a <rs type="software">Firefox</rs> plug-in, to mark 
up Wikipedia articles according to the Wikipedian's repu-
tation. Both approaches have their merits and are both 
aimed at maintaining quality in the open wiki setting. </p>

variance (ANOVA) and Pearson chi-square tests. Age-and sex-
adjusted and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were 
used to examine the association between dairy product and 
milk intake and MetS components. An additional multivariate 
model including age, sex, physical activity, alcohol consump-
tion, total energy intake, smoking status, education, and income 
as covariates was used. The proportional hazards assumption 
was graphically assessed using log-log plots and statistically as-
sessed on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals (15). No major vio-
lations of the proportional hazard assumption were detected. A 
two-sided P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

fixation and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were carried out as 
previously described. [13] The proliferative index in the bone meta-
static lesions was assessed by staining with a Ki67 antibody (1 μg/ml; 
Abcam, Toronto, ON, Canada). Anti-Cleaved-Caspase 3 staining 
(0.2 μg/ml dilution; Cell Signaling, Whitby, ON, Canada) was per-
formed to quantify apoptosis within the bone lesions. Following 
incubation with the primary antibody, secondary biotin-conjugated 
antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was applied for 30 min. After washing 
with distilled water, slides were developed with diaminobenzidine 
(Dako) as the chromogen. All slides were counterstained using Harris 
haematoxylin before being scanned using a Scanscope XT digital slide 
scanner (Aperio). Quantification was performed by analyzing bone 
metastases with <rs id="software-2" type="software">Imagescope</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Aperio</rs>) using positive pixel 
count algorithm for Ki67 and Cleaved Caspase-3 staining. For quanti-
fication of Ki67 and Cleaved Caspase-3 staining, positively stained 
nuclei were represented as a percentage of total nuclei per field. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were carried out by <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> statistics for 
Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 20.0.</rs>. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM Corp, Armonk, NY</rs>). Continuous 
variables were expressed as meanAESD and analyzed by 
unpaired t tests, with Welch adjustment when necessary. 
Continuous variables that violated the normality assumption 
were expressed as median and 25th to 75th percentiles and 
analyzed by a Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables 
were expressed as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequency and 
were analyzed by the Pearson 2-test or the Fisher exact test 
whenever appropriate. Significant level was considered with 
P&lt;0.05. Univariate analysis was carried out for patient data, 
and multivariate analysis by logistic regression was used to 
obtain data about the risk factors for AKI at the 3 time points: 
preoperative, ICU admittance, and 24 hours after ICU admit-
tance. In the multivariate analysis, results were expressed by 
the odds ratio and the 95% confidence interval. The regression 
b of those variables obtained from logistic regression were 
used to develop the final 3 stage scores to predict CSA-AKI. 
The 1152 patients in the validation cohort were scored for 
validation, and the area under the receiver operating charac-
teristic curves (AUROC) as well as Hosmer-Lemeshow good-
ness-of-fit test were applied to estimate the reliability of the 
scoring for predicting CSA-AKI. </p>

<p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts. 8 They can be used to stipulate that a Bitcoin 
payment will be executed only when a certain condition is met. The <rs type="software">Ethereum</rs> network is cur-
rently the leader in the field of smart contracts. Similar to Bitcoin, it is based on blockchain 
technology and provides a native cryptoasset, called Ether. In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum 
provides a more flexible scripting language and is able to track contractual states. Potential 
applications include but are not limited to e-voting systems, identity management and decen-
tralized organization, and various forms of fundraising (e.g., initial coin offerings). </p>

<p>The mean VPW, SD, correlation coefficient, and sample 
size were obtained from each study. <rs id="software-1" type="software">Comprehensive meta-
analysis</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">2.2</rs> and <rs id="software-2" type="software">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">11</rs> (College Station, Texas) 
were used for data analysis. 
26 The summary effect of mean 
VPW (weighted mean) was estimated by assigning weight as 
the inverse of its variance method in the fixed effects of meta-
analysis. 
27 A random effect model, utilizing the DerSimonian 
and Laird method, estimated the summary effect of mean 
VPW. 
28 Similarly, fixed and random effects were estimated for 
cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) as well as correlation coefficiency. 
Two subgroups, erect and supine, were analyzed for VPW 
values. The Q-test, which is a chi-square method, was used for 
comparison between these 2 groups based on Cochran 
method. 
29 A P value less than 0.05 was considered a 
statistically significant difference between groups. </p>

<p>Thirty-four items were included in the draft instru-
ment: 27 from the qualitative analysis and seven from 
previous surveys. Items relating to similar concepts were 
included to explore alternative wording; redundancy was 
checked during data analysis. A full explanation of item 
derivation is provided in online supplementary appendix 
1. All items were written in the second person to person-
alise the survey and to clarify that respondents were 
being asked about their personal beliefs regarding their 
own back. Text readability was assessed using the 
Microsoft <rs id="software-0" type="software">Word</rs> Office Package (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft Corp.</rs>, 
Redmond, WA), following the procedure described by 
Badarudeen and Sabharwal. </p>

<p>Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were New 
Zealand citizens or residents aged 18 years and above. 
Participants were randomly selected from the New 
Zealand Electoral Roll (it is a legal requirement for all 
New Zealanders aged 18 years and above to be listed on 
this roll). Participants were excluded if they had an over-
seas postal address on the roll. In order to achieve an esti-
mation accuracy of ±5% for prevalence data, 400 complete 
responses were required (http://www.openepi.com, 
accessed 30 May 2012). The likely response rate was esti-
mated to be 40%,

Four hundred responses were also 
considered sufficient for analysis of principal compo-
nents.

<p>Multiphoton intravital imaging of the BM. We prepared the mouse cal-
varian BM as described previously (Junt et al., 2007). We used a BioTech 
TriMScope system (LaVision BioTec) and Ti: Sa laser (MaiTai) to capture 
images through a 20× water immersion objective lens (NA = 0.95; Olym-
pus). Images were acquired with ImSpectorPro (LaVision BioTec). For 
three-dimensional (3D) acquisition, the stacks were acquired at a 920-nm 
wavelength at vertical spacing of 2-3 µm to cover an axial depth of 30-100 µm 
(for YFP or EGFP). Subsequently, the same stacks were acquired at a wave-
length of 800 nm (for TRITC-dextran). The distances between MKs and 
vasculatures were measured in the reconstructed 3D structure using <rs id="software-3" type="software">Volocity</rs> 
software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">PerkinElmer</rs>). If MKs were outside the vessels, the closest distance 
from MKs to vessels was measured and represented as negative values. If MKs 
were in direct physical contact with the vessels, the distance was regarded as </p>

<p>Immunostaining. Anti-mouse S1pr1 (Zytomed), anti-human S1PR1 
(ABR), anti-S1pr2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-S1pr4 (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Inc.), antitubulin (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-mouse 
CD41 (BD), and anti-CD42c (Emfret Analytics) antibodies were used for 
immunostaining. The samples were examined using Leica microscopy 
equipped with 40× objective lens (NA = 0.7) or 20× objective lens (NA = 0.5) 
and commercial charge-coupled device camera (AxioCam; Carl Zeiss). 
Images were acquired by <rs id="software-0" type="software">AxioVision</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Carl Zeiss</rs>). For quantification 
of MK number and size in BM, we counted the total number of MKs in five 
randomly selected 20× microscopic fields, and the area of MK cell body was 
analyzed by <rs id="software-1" type="software">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>). </p>

<p>MK culture. Mouse embryonic day (E) 12.5-14.5 FL cells were cultivated 
in TPO-containing medium for differentiation into MKs (Lecine et al., 
1998). In brief, mouse FLs were isolated from E12.5-14.5 embryos and kept 
in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated FBS 
(PAN) in the presence of hTPO (ImmunoTools) in a humidified 5% 
CO 2 /95% air incubator at 37°C. For isolation of immature MKs, E12.5-
14.5 FL cells were cultured in medium for 12 h and then incubated with 
FITC-CD41 (BD) and PE-CD34 (BioLegend) antibodies. Immature MKs 
were identified as a CD41/CD34 double-positive population and enriched 
by using a FACSAria cell sorter (BD). Mature MKs were enriched by BSA 
gradient, as described previously (Pang et al., 2006). In brief, the BSA step 
gradient was prepared by placing PBS containing 1.5% BSA on top of PBS 
with 3% BSA (PAA). Cells were loaded on top of the gradient, and MKs 
were settled to the bottom within 30 min at 1× gravity at room temperature. 
Mature MKs formed a pellet at the bottom of the tube. We distinguished 
and scored PPs according to the criteria mentioned previously (Chen et al., 
2007). To inhibit the activity of Rac GTPases, we cultured MKs in the pres-
ence of 50 µM NSC23766 (Tocris Bioscience) for 3 d and then scored MKs 
carrying PPs. To establish a stable gradient during the slow process of PPF, 
we applied chemotaxis -slides (ibidi), which consist of two large reservoirs 
with different chemoattractant concentrations and a thin (1 mm) slit be-
tween these two reservoirs. A linear and stable chemoattractant gradient is 
established in the slit by diffusion (Zengel et al., 2011). MKs were resus-
pended in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 1 µM VPC23019 
(Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) and loaded onto chemotaxis -slides coated with 
poly-l-lysine between two large reservoirs. 10 µM S1P or vehicle was 
applied into one of the reservoirs of the -slides. MKs were cultivated for 
10 h at 37°C, and polarization of PPF was evaluated based on the images 
captured using an Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with 20× 
objective lens (Nikon) and <rs type="software">AxioVision</rs> software. </p>

<p>HeLa cells transfected with siRNA against C7orf30 or 
stably transfected HEK293T cells expressing C7orf30. 
FLAG.STREP2 or mutants thereof were induced with 
doxycycline (50 ng/ml) for 3 days prior to 
35 S labelling. 
Growth medium was replaced with methionine/cysteine-
free DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutam-
ine, 48 mg/ml cysteine and 50 mg/ml uridine. The cells 
were incubated for 2 Â 10 min in this medium, then 
transferred to methionine/cysteine-free DMEM medium 
containing 10% (v/v) dialysed FCS and emetine 
dihydrochloride (100 mg/ml). Cells were incubated for 
10 min before addition of 120 mCi/ml of [ 
35 S]-methionine. 
Labelling was performed for 15 min and the cells were 
washed twice with standard growth medium. Protein 
samples (30 mg) were separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE

<p>Transthoracic 2D, M-mode, and Doppler imaging were 
performed in 8 animals per group using a Vivid 7 Ultrasound 
(GE Healthcare, Aurora, OH) echograph with linear and 
sectorial probes operated at 14 and 10 MHz, respectively, and 
data were analyzed using <rs type="software">Echopac</rs> PC software. Animals 
were examined 28 days post-bleomycin instillation under 
isofluran-induced narcosis (2.5%, inhalation). Measurements, 
performed by 2 sonographers blinded to the treatment groups, 
were made in accordance with the conventions of the 
American Society of Echocardiography. M-mode measure-
ments of RV free wall thickness and end-diastolic cavity 
dimension (left ventricle: LV and RV areas) were measured in 
the parasternal short axis view, just below the level of the 
aortic valve, and their ratio was calculated. Pulsed wave 
Doppler of pulmonary outflow was recorded in the para-
sternal short axis view at the level of the aortic valve. The 
sample volume was placed proximal to the pulmonary valve 
leaflets and aligned to maximize laminar flow. In addition, the 
PA acceleration time, velocity time integral, and ejection time 
(ET) were measured. By combining PA velocity time integral, 
PA area, and heart rate, echographic cardiac output was 
determined. The tricuspid valve was also evaluated for the 
presence of tricuspid regurgitation with color and continuous-
wave Doppler in the apical 4-chamber view; no alteration was 
detected. At the time of killing, that is, after echocardiography, 
a rapid excision of the lungs and heart was performed through 
a ventral thoracotomy, and each organ was weighed. After 
removal of the atria to the plane of the atrial-ventricular valves, 
the RV free wall was dissected from the LV and septum. The 
RV and LV + septum were weighed, and the RV-to-LV + 
septum ratio (Fulton index) was calculated. Tibia lengths were 
measured to normalize read outs because animals presented 
body weight differences between the groups at the end of 
study. Eight RVs from each group were then processed for </p>

<p>Pulmonary arterial wall thickness measurement was 
adapted from Mouchaers et al 
16 to assess pulmonary vascular 
hypertrophy. Lungs (left lobe) and hearts (RV) were cut sag-
ittally, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (4% 
formaldehyde), embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 mm, and 
stained with hematoxylin-eosin, sirius red, and Orcein (lungs 
only). Slides were examined with Olympus BX46 micro-
scope, DP25 digital camera, and <rs id="software-1" type="software">CellSens Standard</rs> software 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 1.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Olympus Corporation</rs>, Tokyo, Japan). For each 
group, 24 transversely cut muscular pulmonary arterioles, 
ranging from 15 to 100 mm in diameter, were randomly 
selected, depicted at high-power field (objective ·40), and 
measured in a blinded fashion. The internal lamina elastic 
was considered as inner perimeter; therefore, the real caliber 
was extrapolated independently from the contraction status of 
the arteries, and then the relative pulmonary arterial wall 
thickness (RPAWT) was calculated as follows: </p>

<p>. The long-range periodic 
electrostatic interactions were evaluated by Ewald sums. The results presented here 
are based on a lattice energy minimization of motionless molecules (that is, finite 
temperature effects are totally neglected). To validate this approach, we attempted 
to reproduce the experimental crystal structure of 1. For 1, the initial guess for the 
optimization was the experimentally determined unit cell. The effect of charges 
calculated by PBE/DNP 
34 and B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) levels of theory on the unit 
cell parameters of 1 are shown in Supplementary Table S1, indicated by (DNP) and 
(G), respectively. Both yield comparable structure parameters to the experimentally 
determined unit cell, although B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) charges have slightly better 
agreement with the experimental unit cell parameters and density. Consequently, 
the latter was used for the computations on 2 and 7. All crystal prediction calcula-
tions were carried out with the <rs type="software">Materials Studio Modules</rs>, <rs type="software">Forcite</rs> and <rs type="software">DMol </p>

<p>Mutation analysis. To identify mutations in AKT1, direct 
sequencing was performed as described (Pansuriya et al, 2011), 
using DNA derived from 57 tumours, 8 cell lines and 1 primary 
culture (L3310) using forward <rs type="software">primer 3</rs>

pleckstrin homology domain. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. Survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier 
analysis and the log-rank test. Values of Pp0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. Variables that achieved significance 
(Pp0.05) were entered subsequently into a multivariate analysis 
using the Cox regression model. Cox regression analysis was 
carried out with clinical outcome (overall survival) as the 
independent variable. Correlation between expression and grade 
and individual stainings were evaluated using Pearson chi-squared 
test for independent variables. Values of Pp0.05 for asymptomatic 
two-sided testing were considered significant. The data were 
analysed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 17.0</rs> software (Chicago, IL, USA). 
For combination assays, the combination index according to the 
method of Chou and Talalay (1984) was calculated. A combination 
index (CI) of below 1 indicates synergy, and CI of above 1 indicates 
additive effect. Correlation between combination indices was 
evaluated using independent two-sided t-test using GraphPad 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">Prism 5</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">La Jolla, CA, USA</rs>). Values of Pp0.05 were 
considered significant. </p>

<p>identify S 2, the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) was 
marked. The midpoint between the two PSISs, according 
to Gray's Anatomy, was considered as the spinous process 
of the S 2 . 
To identify L 1 , the examiner pressed the lower back 
above the iliac crest in order to move the soft tissue later-
ally where the two thumbs reach horizontally together 
on the L 4 spinous process. By counting up the vertebrae, 
the L 1 spinous process was identified. Then, the flexible 
ruler was placed on L 1 and S 2 while a hand pressed on it 
to eliminate the gap between the ruler and the skin. The 
ruler was put on a sheet and the lumbar curve was drawn 
afterwards [18]. 
Measurement of the thoracic curvature was performed 
in a similar manner to that of the lumbar curvature. The 
only difference was that C7 and the junction of T12 and 
L1 were marked in order to measure the thoracic curva-
ture [19]. The thoracic curve was drawn by using a flex-
ible ruler. Two ends of the curve reached together, and 
a L line was drawn whose midline vertically reached the 
middle of the curve through the h line. The lengths of h 
and L lines were calculated and the aforementioned angle 
was obtained. The line was drawn from the side of the 
ruler which touched the skin.

<p>The Simulation Technique 
The core of the model is an extremely simple representation of worker move-
ments into and out of jobs. It is written in <rs type="software">BASIC</rs>, a close analogue to <rs type="software">FORTRAN</rs>. 
Most PC owners have access to the software necessary to build and run BASIC 
programs. 
In this simple model, workers will be homogeneous as to skills and other 
characteristics, and all will be equally acceptable to employers for all jobs. Considera-
tions relating to wage levels, either on the supply side or the demand side, will be 
pushed under the rug. (The significance of this formulation is discussed below.) The 
number of jobs that employers want to fill each week will be exogenously determined: 
fed into the computer as data. Workers, after a brief period of search, will take any 
job that is offered. The size of the labor force will be constant. If the analyst desires a 
more realistic model, all of these features can be changed quite easily. 
Each "week," the actors in the model carry out a round of simulated activities. 
The micro-level scenario for a week is as follows: First, employers decide on the stock 
of jobs they wish to have filled this week. Some workers will be laid off, others will 
quit. The workers to be separated from jobs are picked at random from the ranks of 
the employed to join the ranks of the unemployed. After the separations have 
occurred, the unemployed (including some separated in previous periods who have not 
yet taken jobs) search for job vacancies; some are chosen at random to come to an 
interview, and some of these agree to become employed. At the end of the weekly 
activity, the "Census Bureau" surveys the situations of all the simulated individuals. It 
notes whether they are in a state of unemployment, and how long that state has </p>

<p>Data analysis was carried out using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 21.0</rs>. Chi-squared 
tests were used to compare the sociodemographic profile of Aboriginal 
and non-Aboriginal participants. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal participants for 
physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep, neighborhood built en-
vironment and social support variables were estimated using forced 
entry binary logistic regression models, adjusting (where appropriate) 
for age and sex (Model 1). Models were further adjusted for remoteness 
of residence (Model 2) and education level (Model 3). 
Similar models examined the factors associated with meeting the 
physical activity recommendations, separately in Aboriginal and non-
Aboriginal participants. Effect modification of the relationship between 
each sociodemographic, behavioral, neighborhood built environment 
and social support factor and achieving the recommended physical ac-
tivity levels by Aboriginal status was also examined using interaction 
tests. </p>

<p>Immunofluorescent labeling was conducted on 
frozen cortical brain sections of Htau (Jackson 
Laboratory, stock #004808, n = 3), and wildtype 
(WT) (Taconic, BALB/c, n = 2) mice as well as 
brain samples from FTLD (n = 4), AD (n = 4), and 
age-matched controls (n = 4) (Oregon Brain Bank). 
P301L (Taconic, stock #2508, n = 3) mouse eye 
sections were also used. Immunofluorescence was 
conducted as previously published [35]. Briefly, the 
sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, per-
meabilized in 0.5% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO), and the human sections were treated 
with an autofluorescence eliminator as per manufac-
turer instructions (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). 
Mouse and human sections were blocked in 3% 
bovine serum albumin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, 
PA), and were then incubated with tau oligomer-
specific polycolonal antibody T22 (mouse-1:250, 
human-1:200, [22]) in 4 • C overnight. The following 
day, the sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit 
IgG Alexa-488 or Alexa-568 (1:500, Invitrogen, 
Waltham, MA) for 1 h. Sections were then incubated 
overnight with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 
(mouse and human-1:150, BioLegend, San Diego, 
CA), Iba1 (mouse and human-1:100, Abcam, 
Cambridge, MA), or high motility group box 1 
(HMGB1) (Mouse-1:50, Abcam, human-1:500, 
Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 • C. The sections were incubated 
with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa-568 (1:500, Invitro-
gen) or goat anti-rabbit 568 for 1 h. The sections were 
stained with 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) 
(Invitrogen) and mounted in Fluoromount-G (South-
ernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). The retinal slides 
were imaged with a confocal LSM510 Zeiss laser 
scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, 
USA) as a single digital image. The brain sections 
were imaged on a Nikon A1R MP laser scanning 
microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) at 60X magnifi-
cation under oil submersion. The objective numerical 
aperture was 1.4. Using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>, the corrected cell 
fluorescence method was used to quantify the images 
as previously described [35, 36]. Briefly, there were 
four separate images from each section analyzed 
using this method where five cells were measured as 
well as five background regions. In order to account 
for cell size and background, the background was 
multiplied by the area of the cell and subtracted from 
the total fluorescence. One-way ANOVA, student's 
t-tests, or Pearson's correlation were used to analyze 
the corrected cell fluorescence on Graphpad Prism </p>

<p>6 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA). In addition, 
Pearson's correlation coefficient was measured to 
quantify the strength of co-localization between T22 
and GFAP using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software. </p>

<p>An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
was conducted to detect the astrocyte marker, GFAP, 
and total tau. All measurements were performed in 
triplicate. Plates were coated with 30 g/well using 
0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, as coating 
buffer, followed by overnight incubation at 4 • C. Age-
matched control (n = 4), FTLD (n = 4), and AD (n = 4) 
brains obtained from the Oregon Brain bank, were 
used in the ELISA. Negative and positive controls 
were conducted. The positive control was Tg2576 
insoluble brain homogenate with 0.05% Triton-X in 
PBS. Plates were washed 1 time with Tris-buffered 
saline with low Tween (0.01%) (TBST), then blocked 
for 2 h at room temperature with 10% nonfat dry 
milk in TBST. The plates were then washed with 
TBST 1 time. Anti-GFAP (1:2000, Covance, Prince-
ton, NJ) was diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST 
and added to one plate. Anti-Tau5 (1:1000, Mil-
lipore), diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST, was 
added to another plate and all were allowed to react 
for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then 
washed 3 times with TBST and 100 l of horseradish 
peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:3000, Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA) was added. The plates were 
incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, plates 
were washed 3 times with TBST and developed 
with 3,3',5,5',-tetramethylbenzidine substrate from 
DAKO (Carpentaria, CA). The reaction was stopped 
with 100 l 1 M HCl, and samples were read at 
450 nm using a POLARstar OMEGA plate reader 
(BMG Labtechnologies, Ortenberg, Germany). One-
way ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test was 
used to analyze results on <rs id="software-4" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">6</rs> (Graph-

<p>cell in order to obtain a corrected cell fluorescence. 
The corrected cell fluorescence for five cells per 
image were averaged and a One-Way ANOVA with a 
multiple comparisons test was conducted to compare 
control (n = 4, 20 cells quantified), FTLD (n = 4, 20 
cells quantified), and AD (n = 4, 20 cells quantified). 
A student's unpaired t-test was used for the mouse 
quantifications with two groups while a One-Way 
ANOVA was used for the mouse samples with more 
than two groups. For the ELISA, One-Way ANOVA 
was used with multiple comparisons test. All statis-
tics were performed on <rs type="software">GraphPad Prism6</rs> (GraphPad 
Software) and p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. </p>

<p>A correlation analysis is used as a statistical method to 
define the relationship. Calculations were made using <rs type="software">MS 
Excel</rs> and are presented in Appendix 1. 
Based on the countries' classification provided by the 
World Economic Forum (Sala-i-Martin et al. 2008), several 
countries were chosen for comparison: the Baltic states 
as having the most similar economic situation. Austria, 
Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands were chosen as small but 
highly developed countries, while France and Germany 
were included as similarly developed big countries. As GDP 
growth is used as a basic indicator for this analysis it should 
be emphasized that it is different in the groups of the Baltic 
states and the developed countries. The growth of all three 
Baltic states is about four times that (except Russian crisis 
in 1999) of other countries analysed. This is graphically 
shown in Fig. 1. 
only the indicators with the statistically significant cor-
relation are chosen and presented in Table 1. Correlation 
coefficients were calculated using the log change of sustain-
able development indicator and the log change of GDP (in 
constant prices) for the respective country. in many sources 
(Čekanavičius, Murauskas 2002) the correlation coefficient 
of 0.30 is described as a minimal level for the relationship 
to be valid, but this is only true for large data samples, 
more than 50 data points. For a small data sample (as in 
this work) the significance of the correlation coefficient can 
be determined by using standard distribution calculated by 
Student t test. Alternatively, a simple formula to determine 
the approximate critical value of the correlation coefficient 
at 0.05 level of significance was introduced (Walsh 2008): </p>

<p>All of the in vitro experiments were performed in triplicate, 
and data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation 
(SD) of three independent experiments. Wherever appro-
priate, the data were subjected to statistical analysis by a 
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by the 
Student-Newman-Keuls test for comparison of all pairs of 
means. A value of P&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically 
significant. <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">11.5</rs> for Windows software was used for

(<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Adobe</rs>). Thresholding and quantification of the whole-vessel images 
were performed using MetaMorph Imaging software (Molecular Devices). 
An inclusive threshold was applied to the -SMA channel so that the 
background was captured by, while all SMC were excluded from, the 
threshold. The length of the vessel was measured and divided into quar-
ters. A region was drawn around each vessel segment, excluding over-
lapping blood vessels. The SMC coverage was calculated and 
subtracted from 100%. A similar thresholding technique was used to 
quantify the percentage of LVYE-1 immunofluorescence. The line tool in 
MetaMorph was used to measure the width of the widest and narrowest 
vessel points. </p>

<p>Analysis of lymphatic vessel function 
For qualitative analysis of lymphatic vessel function, FITC-dextran (8 mg/ml 
in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected intradermally into the ears of anaes-
thetized mice and analyzed by confocal microscopy. For quantitative 
analysis, 2 µl of ICG dye (1% in dH 2 O; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into 
the footpads of anaesthetized mice inside the IVIS Spectrum Whole Body 
Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). Image acquisition and analysis 
was performed with <rs id="software-7" type="software">Living Image</rs> <rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">3</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-7" type="creator">Caliper Life Sciences</rs>) using 
the following parameters: field of view 6.6, binning 8, and F-stop 2. 
70 images were taken with a 2-s exposure time and no delay between 
acquisitions, which resulted in an image every 3-4 s. The efficiency of 
the fluorescent signal was measured in a region of interest (ROI) created 
around a small area of the lymphatic vessel above the knee. The mean 
efficiency against time was plotted using <rs id="software-8" type="software">Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">5</rs> software, using 4 s as 
an interval. For the quantitative Evans blue assay, 2 µl Evan's blue dye 
(2%; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the hind limb footpad. After 5 min, 
the mice were sacrificed and inguinal lymph nodes were dissected. Both 
inguinal lymph nodes were weighed together and a mean value was used 
to calculate dye content in each of them separately. Each lymph node was 
placed in 5 µl formamide at 60°C for 24 h, followed by an absorbance 
reading at 620 nm. Evans blue concentration was calculated using a stan-
dard curve and presented as dye content per gram of tissue. </p>

<p>Microarray analysis 
To identify lymphatic-specific ECM molecules, mesenteric arteries, veins, 
and lymphatic vessels were dissected from P7 wild-type (C57BL/6J) pups. 
Samples from nine animals (in two litters) were pooled. Total RNA was 
extracted and RNase-treated using an RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN) as per 
the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of RNA from two independent sam-
ples of each vessel was amplified using WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplifica-
tion System (NuGEN) and used for expression profiling using the Mouse 
exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. The array data were processed using robust multiarray analysis 
(Irizarry et al., 2003) to generate gene-level signal estimates for core level 
probe sets. The arrays were normalized using quantile normalization and 
antigenomic probes used to model the background. Quantification was run 
using apt-1.10.0 from Affymetrix. Before statistical analysis, all Affymetrix 
control probe sets were removed. Gene changes were selected using a 
linear model where the standard errors were corrected using empirical 
Bayes shrinkage (fdr &lt; 0.05). To identify lymphatic-specific transcriptional 
changes, we applied a nestedF procedure across the three contrasts, selecting 
genes significant in only the lymphatic groups (fdr &lt; 0.05). Analysis 
was performed in <rs id="software-1" type="software">Bioconductor</rs> (Gentleman et al., <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2004</rs>) using <rs type="software">Limma</rs>. 
Genes that were expressed at least twofold higher in different vessel types 
were searched in Uniprot database to identify proteins involved in ECM 
function or structure. </p>

<p>Image acquisition and quantitative analyses 
Confocal images for Figs. 2 (B and C), 3 (G and H), 6 (C-E), S3 (A-D), 
and S5 (F-H), were acquired at room temperature using a confocal micro-
scope (LSM 710; Zeiss Imager.Z2 and Zen 2009 software; Carl Zeiss) 
with a Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 NA air objective lens (Fig. 6, C-E; and 
Fig. S5, F-H) or DIC Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.3 NA water immersion 
objective lens (Fig. 2, B and C; Fig. 3, G and H; and Fig. S3, A-D). All other 
confocal images were acquired using an <rs id="software-4" type="software">LSM 510</rs> microscope (Axioplan 2 
and LSM 510 <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 3.2</rs> software; all from <rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Carl Zeiss</rs>), with Plan-Apochromat 
10×/0.45 NA (Fig. S2, A-D) or 20×/0.75 NA (Fig. 4, A and B; and Fig. 
S2, E and F) air objective lenses, or Korr C-Apochromat 63×/1.2 NA 
(Fig. S1, G and H) or 40×/1.2 NA (all other images) water immersion 
objective lenses. All confocal images, except Fig. S1 (G and H), repre-
sent maximum projection images of confocal z stacks. For visualization of 
collecting vessels from the proximal to distal end of the ear, images were 
captured along the length of three randomly chosen collecting lymphatic 
vessels from Reln 
/ (n = 5) and wild-type (n = 4) mice. The same analysis 
was performed for Apoer2

Transwell migration assay 
Migration assay was performed using 6.5-mm Transwell with 8 µm poly-
carbonate membrane inserts (Corning) in a 24-well plate. The lower face 
of the membrane was coated with 1 µg/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) 
before use. Confluent HUVSMC were serum-deprived in SMC growth 
medium containing 0.2% BSA for 22 h. 1 × 10 
5 cells were seeded in 
the upper chamber and allowed to migrate toward EC growth medium 
(control) or conditioned medium collected from LECs over a 48-h period, 
full-length Reelin supernatant from HEK 293 cells (diluted 1:20), control 
supernatant (diluted 1:20), 10 ng/ml MCP-1 (R&amp;D Systems), or 3 ng/ml 
PDGF-BB (R&amp;D Systems) over a 23-h period. Reelin function was inhibited 
using blocking antibody against Reelin (CR-50, 50 µg/ml; MBL). Cells 
on the upper face of the membrane were removed and migrated cells on 
the lower face were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution 
in 25% methanol. Images of the filters were acquired with a stereomicro-
scope (MZ16 F) equipped with a camera (DFC420C) and <rs id="software-9" type="software">Microsystems</rs> 
software (all from <rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Leica</rs>). After photographing, the incorporated dye was 
solubilized in 0.2 ml sodium citrate solution, followed by absorbance 
reading at 550 nm. </p>

<p>End-labeled RNAs were denatured for 5 min at 958C, 
allowed to refold for 15 min at 378C, and partially digested 
with RNase A (0.005 U/ml) or RNase TI (0.05 U/ml) 
(both from Ambion), and the resulting fragments were 
resolved on sequencing gels. Both partially digested RNAs 
and control RNAs (ladders) were prepared following the 
manufacturer's directions. Alkaline-digested end-labeled 
RNA was used as a ladder to assign gel bands to specific 
residues in the RNA sequence. 
After electrophoresis for 3 h at 900 V and 12 mA, gels 
were dried, exposed to a PhosphorScreen overnight and 
visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular 
Dynamics). <rs type="software">ImageQuant</rs> software was used to measure 
cleavage intensities at each residue position. Positions 78 
and 80 were used as standards to normalize cleavage 
intensities at all other positions because they were con-
sistently strongly cleaved in independent reactions. To 
calculate fold differences in cleavage intensities between 
mutant and wild-type RNA, sxy-1 or sxy-7 values were 
divided by wild-type values at each position. At positions 
where mutant RNAs were more weakly cut than wild-
type, wild-type values were instead divided by mutant and 
then expressed as a negative value. </p>

<p>18 The dependent variable in our demand equations is the natural log of reported rent less the natural 
log of price. In our log-log specification, subtracting the log of price from both sides alters only the coefficient 
on the log of price. In particular, it has no effect on the disturbances. Consequently, any instrument valid 
for estimating a rent regression is also valid for estimation when the dependent variable is the log of rent 
less the log of price. It is tempting to look for land price data to use as an instrument, given the importance 
of land's cost in supply. However, a valid instrument cannot be correlated with the part of an endogenous 
explanatory that is correlated with the disturbance term (Murray, 2006). Land values are largely locally 
driven, so shocks to local housing demand are likely to be reflected in local land prices. We would need 
an instrument with both temporal and cross-sectional variation that is uncorrelated with the endogenous 
component of land price. Such is hard to come by. 
19 The construction cost index (http://enr.construction.com/economics) is based on "200 hours of com-
mon labor at the 20-city average of common labor rates, plus 25 cwt of standard structural steel shapes at 
the mill price prior to 1996 and the fabricated 20-city price from 1996, plus 1.128 tons of Portland cement 
at the 20-city price, plus 1,088 board-ft of 2 × 4 lumber at the 20-city price." The building cost index is 
based on "68.38 hours of skilled labor at the 20-city average of bricklayers, carpenters and structural iron 
workers rates, plus 25 cwt of standard structural steel shapes at the mill price prior to 1996 and the 
fabricated 20-city price from 1996, plus 1.128 tons of Portland cement at the 20-city price, plus 1,088 board 
ft of 2 × 4 lumber at the 20-city price." Many of the components of the index are determined in regional 
markets, but labor's cost is determined more locally. Since rent is one determinant of local wages among 
many, there remains room for concern about the construction cost index as a valid instrument. 
20 The incomes in the regression have been adjusted for price differences between the census year 
and the preceding year, but not for any growth or fall in incomes. 
21 The P-values of the F-statistics for the relevance of the instruments in the rental-housing price and 
income reduced form equations are 0.053 and less than 0.0005, respectively. While the instruments appear 
relevant, we find that the instruments are weak for rental housing's price (using Finlay and Magnuson's 
2009 riv test routine in <rs type="software">STATA</rs>, which is robust to clustered disturbances, and conditioning on the IV 
estimate of the income elasticity). The instruments' weakness arises because fixed-effects for city and year 
in the model absorb much of the variation in both the cost indices and the price of rental housing, leaving </p>

tions in each of 1 000 pseudoreplicates. Sequences obtained 
from GenBank are listed by their taxon names followed by ac-

<p>Methods. All the prospective randomized controlled tri-
alsof surgery combined with TCM in the treatment of 
glaucoma were searched in the databases of Medline

the quality of the included studies, extracted the relevant

combined with TCM versus western medicine or surgery 
alone were calculated as the effect size by meta-analy-

dence interval (CI). Measurement data was demonstrated 
by mean with its standard difference and pooled by stan-
dard mean difference (SMD). Statistical heterogeneity of 
the results across the included studies was evaluated by 
Chi-square (χ 
2 ) test [8], and the inconsistency was calcu-
lated by I2 [9]. If heterogeneity was found (χ 
2 , p&lt;0.05 or 
I2&gt;50%), the random-effect method (Dersimonian-Laird 
method) was used to pool the data. Otherwise, without 
significant heterogeneity, fixed-effect method was used. 
The Egger's tests were performed to evaluate publication 
bias as described by Egger [10]. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">11.0</rs> for 
<rs type="software">WINDOWS</rs>. The Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman 
correlation were used to test for significant differences in 
the total SIB, K-MMSE and S-ADL scores according to sex, 
age and education. The validity of the SIB was determined 
by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients between 
the SIB and the K-MMSE, CDR, and S-ADL. Cronbach's 
coefficient alpha and item-total correlation coefficients were 
generated to examine the internal consistency of the SIB. 
Also, Spearman correlation coefficients were generated to eval-
uate the 3 months test-retest reliability. The Mann-Whitney 
U test was used to assess the differences in the mean SIB total 
score for the various CDR stages. Finally, a ROC curve was 
used to compare the sensitivity, specificity and probability </p>

<p>Bioinformatics 
For the bioinformatics analyses, we used a standar-
dised pipeline including (i) quality filtering, 
(ii) clustering and (iii) taxonomy annotation. 
Low-quality tails were removed from the reads and 
trimmed reads with an average Phred quality score 
less than 25 were discarded. Additionally, we 
removed all reads with at least one base with a 
quality of less than 15 and also all reads that 
contained errors in the primer regions. Multiplex 
Identifiers were used to separate the different 
samples. Chimeras were removed using UCHIME 
(<rs id="software-0" type="software">USEARCH</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v.6</rs>) (Edgar et al., 2011). Subsequently, 
the sequences that passed the quality filtering were 
clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) 
with <rs id="software-1" type="software">UCLUST</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 6</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Edgar</rs>, 2010) at 97% 
sequence identity for further analyses. Sequences 
were sorted by abundance beforehand clustering 
and clustering was performed for all sequences of all 
sampling campaigns at a time (that is, not individu-
ally by campaigns). For all OTUs, we used <rs id="software-2" type="software">BLASTn</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 2.2.25+</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Altschul</rs> et al., 1990) with the 
nucleotide collection database nr/nt and the NCBI 
Taxonomy Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 
taxonomy; RefSeq Release 57 (14 January 2013)) 
to annotate the OTUs with taxonomic information. 
For reasons of comparison, we also processed our

calculated for the qualitative variables and means and 
standard deviations for the numerical variable. </p>

<p>Student t test was used to compare continuous variables, 
and Pearson chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used 
to compare categorical variable. Values of p &lt; 0.05 were

<p>Mice were killed by CO 2 asphyxiation; then tissue was quickly harvested and fixed 
overnight at room temperature with Z-fix solution (Anatech LTD, Battle Creek, MI). Tissues 
were processed by using a Leica (Buffalo Grove, IL) ASP300S Tissue Processor, paraffin 
embedded, and cut into 5-μm sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a Dako 
Autostainer Plus (Dako North America, Inc, Carpinteria, CA) or Discovery Ultra XT 
autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems Inc, Tucson, AZ) and counterstaining with 
hematoxylin. Dual immunohistochemistry for CK19 and amylase was performed without 
counterstaining. Picrosirius red staining was performed per the manufacturer's instructions 
(Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA). Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed by using 
Mayer's hematoxylin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and Eosin Y (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). 
Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described. 45 Immunohistochemistry 
slides were scanned on a Pannoramic SCAN slide scanner (Perkin Elmer, WA), and then 
annotation regions encompassing greater than 1 mm of tissue were processed by using 
appropriate algorithms for each stain quantified by using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Halo</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Indica Labs</rs>,

<p>Lysates were quantified by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA), and 
equal protein amounts were run onto sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis gels. Proteins were transferred from sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis gels to Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked, and 
then incubated with primary antibodies. After washing, membranes were then incubated in 
secondary antibody, washed, and then exposed on autoradiography film (Bioexpress, 
Kaysville, UT) with West Pico ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) or scanned on an 
Odyssey CLx scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Quantitation of Western blots was performed 
by using <rs id="software-2" type="software">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD). </p>

<p>To identify IGs and genes with significant changes in gene 
expression the statistical analysis of the data was imple-
mented as a two class unpaired experiment, with one class 
referring to the Crp(À) mutant and the other to the 
wild-type strain of MR1. Biological replicates and time 
points were combined because of the high pair-wise correl-
ation between them (87-99%) across genes and IGs within 
either the wild-type or Crp(À) mutant expression profiles 
(Supplementary Data 1). Stanford <rs type="software">Significance Analysis of 
Microarray (SAM</rs>) software (53) was used for the analysis 
with the recommended parameters and a threshold for 
false discovery rate of 0.06%. Results of the analysis 
(Supplementary Data 2) revealed that almost half of the 
IGs and more than half of the genes significantly changed, 
either decreased or increased, the level of their expression in 
the Crp(À) mutant relative to the wild-type. The percentage 
of IGs yielding significantly decreased expression was about 
the same (28%) as the percentage of genes that were re-
pressed (31%). About 15% of IGs and 21% of genes had a 
significantly increased level of expression. Thus, a change in 
the growth condition in combination with the knockout of 
Crp, a regulator of the MR1 response to the change, induced 
significant transcriptional reprogramming of not only 
genes, but also of IGs in the MR1 genome. </p>

experimental data. The figure indicates that enzymes of the ED pathway (SO2486_ SO2489) as well as pykA are significantly 
upregulated in the Crp(À) mutant, but hexR and the intergenic region between hexR and pykA are downregulated. The regu-
latory information provided in the first track of the browser (TractorDB) gives an explanation for the observed changes in the 
gene expressions. It indicates that the genes, hexR and pykA and the operon with the enzymes of the ED pathway have binding 
sites in their promoters predicted by TractorDB. Thus, both genes and the operon are likely regulated by Crp. In the wild-type 
strain of MR1, the ED pathway is not active because of upregulation of hexR by Crp during the transition from aerobic to 
anaerobic conditions. The Crp(À) mutant strain does not produce Crp; therefore, the transcriptional repressor HexR is absent in 
the mutant, and enzymes of the ED pathway, which were suppressed by HexR in the wild-type strain, are upregulated in the 
Crp(À) strain. </p>

<p>Observers randomly allocated nurses to a list for each observa-
tion session according to the sampling strategy. If a nurse at the 
top of the list was not working that day, observers selected the 
next nurse on the list. A similar approach was used for doctors, 
but on occasion pre-arranged times were requested as doctors 
were more mobile and locating them in the hospital could be 
difficult without this step. Nurses were observed between the 
hours of 7:00 and 19:00 and doctors from 8:00 to 20:00 on 
weekdays. Nurses and doctors were observed while both on and 
off the ward. 
The <rs type="software">Work Observation Method by Activity Timing 
(WOMBAT</rs>) method was applied. 
30-33 This is a technique for 
undertaking direct observational studies of health professionals. 
Using software on a handheld computer, observers capture 
multi-dimensional aspects of work and communication patterns. 
The <rs type="software">WOMBAT</rs> tool automatically captures all time data related 
to tasks and also details interruptions to work and multi-tasking 
(ie, tasks conducted in parallel). For example, details of tasks 
conducted in parallel, such as documenting and answering a 
question from a colleague, could be recorded and time-stamped 
automatically. Figure 1 provides a screenshot of the data collec-
tion tool. The tool can be reconfigured for different task types 
and study designs. Research teams interested in using this soft-
ware should contact the corresponding author ( JIW). </p>

<p>To assess changes in time spent on direct care and medication 
tasks for each profession, we calculated the proportion of total 
observed time in each task category by study period ( pre/post) 
and group (control/intervention wards). We further examined 
medication sub-tasks for doctors and nurses as proportions of 
the total time spent in medication tasks. 95% CIs of proportions 
were obtained using the large sample normal approximation. 
The difference in changes post-eMMS in intervention groups 
relative to control groups was defined as the differences in the 
proportions (P) over time between control and intervention 
groups, that is, (P Intervention_post -P Intervention_pre )−(P Control_post -
P Control_pre ). We compared the difference in changes post-eMMS 
between intervention and control groups in each task category 
using the z test for proportions with the level of significance set 
at p&lt;0.05. Other descriptive statistics for number, average 
length, and frequency of tasks in each task category were also 
presented by study period and group. 
Information sources (eg, desk PC, COW) used in medication 
tasks were determined by calculating the proportions of total 
medication task time undertaken using each source. Time spent 
in interactions was examined in terms of both proportion of 
total observation time in professional communication, and the 
proportion of overall task time completed with others. Data 
were analyzed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">V.9.2</rs>. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses 
All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation 
(SD). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed 
by Tukey's multiple comparison tests was used to analyze 
results from the mouse model. Student's t-test was 
performed to analyze data from the swine experiments. A 
Mann-Whitney U test (nonparametric test) was also used 
to compare microscopic lesion scores (ordinal data) for 
tissues from the experimentally PRRSV-infected pigs. All 
statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 17.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS, USA</rs>). P-values ＜ 0.05 were 
considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>The sample size was calculated using <rs id="software-0" type="software">G power</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.1</rs> soft-
ware. Based on the information drawn from a study by Ak-
can et al. (27), the mean PIPP score was considered 10 with 
a standard deviation of 2. Assuming the equality of vari-
ances of PIPP scores in the intervention groups, alpha er-
ror of 5%, and statistical power of 80%, the required sample 
size to detect a difference of two scores between the groups 
was estimated to be 24. In order to increase the statistical 
power, and considering sample attrition, it was decided to 
include 30 neonates in each group. </p>

<p>explaining other parents had successfully reduced their child 
support, and sending a reminder postcard for those that did 
not respond. While fewer than 50% of eligible inmates par-
ticipated, a social science researcher at ACF explains this 
was a big impact at a low cost. 59 
More recently, researchers have partnered with employ-
ers, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers to develop (or 
investigate) the use of behavioral economics in the health 
care industry. Interventions have ranged from simple nudges 
such as promoting seat belt use or encouraging more healthy 
eating choices by putting the salad bar at the front of a buffet 
to increasing organ donation and providing financial incen-
tives and peer mentoring to improve medication adherence 
for patients with chronic conditions. While many interven-
tions target the patient, some target physicians. For exam-
ple, a radiologist spent more time with a patient's report and 
felt more connected to the patient when the patient's picture 
was attached to an X-ray. Patients were 24 times more likely 
to have a sigmoidoscopy and 9 times more likely to have a 
fecal occult blood test relative to a control group when phy-
sicians suggested screening for colon cancer. 48 These types 
of nudges are geared toward individuals making one-time 
decisions (e.g. organ donation). If the goal is to improve 
medication adherence (a behavior that occurs frequently), 
then the intervention should occur just as frequently. 
Behavioral economists believe automated hovering is one 
way to do this. 55 
Automated hovering has been described as a cost-effec-
tive way to monitor and provide feedback to patients. 
Examples include <rs type="software">NudgerSize</rs> TM (an iPhone application 
that sends daily exercise reminders to users), electronic pill 
bottles, glucometers and other devices that transmit infor-
mation from the patient to the provider. 55 Automatic entry 
into a daily lottery for taking pills is another example. 
While there are advantages to using automated hovering 
(e.g. less resource intensive option for daily engagement), 
it is not for everyone. Asch et al. 60 explain that cell phones 
and automatic pill bottle reminders are not ideal for some-
one frequently hospitalized who likely requires a more 
personnel-intensive approach. In a RCT using electronic 
pill bottles to improve warfarin adherence, only patients 
with baseline international normalized ratio (INR) below 
the therapeutic range showed significant improvements in 
anticoagulation, indicating that the intervention worked for 
only a subset of the population. 51 
Studies using financial incentives to influence a behavio-
ral response varied in their effectiveness. Of those with evi-
dence of effectiveness, many included some form of 
interaction with health care professionals or peers, and most 
behaviors reverted back to baseline once the intervention 
stops. Similarly, offering co-payment reductions through 
value-based insurance design or linking premiums to healthy 
behaviors has only had modest impacts. 55 In a 2009 system-
atic review, adult RTRs, when offered free IST, were 95% 
adherent 6 months post-transplant yet only 48% adherent at </p>

<p>We adjust this figure to account for the temperature profile of each county, because 
electric vehicles use more electricity per mile in cold and hot weather. 
32 Next we 
use an econometric model (described below) to estimate the marginal emissions 
factors (e.g., tons per kWh) for each of our pollutants at each of 1,486 power plants 
due to an increase in regional electricity load. We combine these estimates with an 
assumed daily charging profile to determine the emissions per mile at each power 
plant due to the charging of an electric vehicle in a given county. 
33 The implication 
of this procedure is that emissions per mile for each electric vehicle may differ 
across any two counties. 
Next we map emissions into damages. For CO 2 , we use the EPA social cost of 
carbon of $41 per ton. 
34 For local pollutants, we use the AP2 model. This model 
calculates damages per unit of a given local pollutant in each county (as described 
below). By multiplying emissions per mile and damages per unit emitted, and then 
aggregating across pollutants (and, for electric vehicles, across power plants) we 
obtain the full damages per mile for each gasoline vehicle and each electric vehicle 
in each county. As in the theoretical section, these full damages account for global 
effects, local effects in the given county, and local effects in other counties. 
To analyze any policy which affects multiple counties, we need a sense of the rel-
ative importance of driving in the counties. We weight all summary statistics using 
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in each county, as estimated by the <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">EPA</rs> for their 
Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (<rs id="software-0" type="software">MOVES</rs>). </p>

<p>Amino acids from 367 to 381 within PCSK9 where the EGF-A 
domain of the LDLR binds were considered to be the target of 
the inhibitors. The initial crystal structure of PCSK9 from the 
Protein Data Bank was constructed in the presence of the EGF-
A domain of the LDLR at neutral pH. After removal of the EGF-
A domain, the PCSK9 structure was remodeled by removal of 
water molecules and supplementation of hydrogen atoms. The

<p>abled standard laboratories to carry out a large-scale screen-
ing of small molecular inhibitors of protein-protein interaction 
for drug development at ease. In silico virtual screening has 
been used to discover many small-molecule inhibitory li-
gands for enzymes such as BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, 
23 P. falci-
parum dihydrofolate reductase, 
24 and inhibitors of protein-
protein interaction such as interaction between insulin-like 
growth factor-1 and the N-terminus of the IGF-binding pro-
tein-5 
25 or the C-terminal tail of myosin A and the myosin-tail 
interacting protein in P. falciparum. 
26 However, without any 
evident reason, there have been no known reports involving 
searches for small chemical molecules that inhibit PCSK9-
LDLR interaction. 
In this study, we report the first approach for the develop-
ment of small molecular inhibitors targeting the protein-pro-
tein interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR by performing 
in silico virtual screening using commercially available chemi-
cal libraries and the GOLD algorithm. In general, in order to 
acceptably predict desirable compounds, multiple selection 
processes using various docking programs such as <rs type="software">AutoDock 
Vina</rs> 
27 or Glide 
28 must be applied; however, we did not attempt 
to complete these comprehensive processes, as the primary 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of rela-
tively simple in silico chemical development methods that of-
fered ease of use. 
CB_36, the chemical with the highest docking score among 
100 predicted chemicals, was validated for its ability to inhibit 
the binding of PCSK9 to the EGF-AB domain of the LDLR in a 
dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 1, only online). 
Detailed kinetic studies on the mechanism of inhibition by 
CB_36 were not carried out, as the required research resourc-
es were unavailable and the purpose of this study was limited 
to the overall evaluation of the application of in silico screen-
ing. Direct evidence by mapping the ligand-binding site by

Hu and Smyth (20). Briefly, single cell suspension has ob-
tained from parent and spheroid cells have plated at con-
centration of 1000, 100, 10 cells and 1 cell per well in 0.2 ml 
of CSC medium in 96-well ultra-low attachment (Getbiofil, 
UK) and cultured for 7 days in a humidified incubator at 
37°C and 5% CO 2 . The number of wells containing of colono-
spheres has counted after 7 days. The frequency of sphere 
forming cells in a particular cell type has determined using

P &lt; 0.05. All tests have performed in triplicate. </p>

<p>mor spheroid cells were CD44+/EpCAM+, while parent cells 
only have expressed 38.4 ± 1.6% of CD44+/EpCAM+ markers. 
We have measured ALDH1 activity in colonospheres and 
parent cells-derived colonic HT-29 cell line. Interestingly, 
we have found that HT29 cells have exhibited substantial-
ly high levels of ALDH activity in the parent fractions in 
compared with the spheroid fractions. ALDH activity was 
16.9 ± 1.2 in spheroid cells in comparison with 34.6 ± 2.3 in 
parental cells (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 3). 
We have evaluated the frequency of sphere-forming cells 
by doing an extreme limiting dilution analysis (<rs type="software">ELDA</rs>) for 
spheroid and parent-derived HT-29 cells. The results have 
indicated that the frequency of spheroid formation in 
cell line -derived colonospheres were 6.4 fold higher than 
-derived the parent cells (P &lt; 0.005) (Table 2). The findings 
have suggested that colonospheres have formed by the co-
lon cancer cell have enriched population of CSCs. </p>

<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that in addition 
to primary tumors, established cancer cell lines might 
be contained a subpopulation of cells possessing CSCs 
properties (21, 22). In this research, we have identified 
and characterized CSCs in the colorectal cancer-derived 
cell line HT-29 through investigation of sphere formation 
and surface biomarkers. Studies have shown that under 
serum-free defined media, CSCs had ability to form float-
ing spheroids (19). In consistent with previous observa-
tion, we have shown that in serum-free conditions HT-29 
cell line could form spheroid colonies (colonospheres) 
and following exposure to 10% FBS differentiate into 
large and adherent cells , maintaining self-renewal capac-
ity and differentiation potential. 
Moreover, <rs type="software">ELDA</rs> has resulted for survey functional CSCs 
in colonospheres has revealed that colonospheres has 
marked increasing frequency of cells with sphere-form-
ing ability. Thus, it has suggested under extreme limited 
dilution and in serum-free conditions, spheroids could 
only formed from stem-like cells. Consequently, the for-
mation of colonospheres with a very small number of HT-
29 cell line has demonstrated enrichment CSCs in colono-</p>

Existing video podcasts produced by the skills lab will be 
the focus of the OERs. Clinical skills learning through 
simulations on models (low-fidelity, medium-fidelity) will 
be accompanied and complemented by videos available 
from the <rs type="software">YouTube</rs> channel (http://www.youtube.com/ 
user/TiHoVideos) which was set up in April 2012. Training 
videos for classes and to demonstrate particular skills 
on models/simulators and on live patients are continu-
ously being created. To date, 52 videos have been created 
with 116 subscribers and 30,734 hits (see Figure 1, as 
at 30 September 2013). The videos are useful not only 
as preparation for a session in the skills lab, but also as 
a chance to verify or reinforce particular skills. 
The skills lab opened in February 2013 and since then 
has been available to students during and between 
semesters. Initial evaluations of the 769 visits to the 
teaching stations from March to September 2013 show 
that there was a high level of interest, and not just during 
semesters, in the elective teaching on offer in the skills 
lab of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, 
Foundation (se Figure 2). The largest user group is stu-
dents in semesters 7-8, as they are approaching the 
practical year in semesters 9-10.

<p>DNA sequences analyses 
A shotgun metagenomics approach was applied on 
all three size fractions of four samples from Lakes 
Cisó and Banyoles C-III. Identical reads were 
removed using CD-HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006). 
Annotation of metagenomic reads was conducted 
through the <rs type="software">JCVI</rs> prokaryotic annotation pipeline 
(Tanenbaum et al., 2010) using Uniref100, PFAM, 
TIGRfam and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes) Orthologs (KO) databases for taxo-
nomic and functional annotation. <rs id="software-2" type="software">JCVI</rs> Metage-
nomics reports (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://jcvi.org/metarep</rs>) were used 
for analysis and comparative metagenomics (Goll 
et al., 2010). KO annotation was used for functional 
analysis and KO counts were normalized according 
to the length of the read and the length of the target 
gene (Sharon et al., 2009). The communities and 
functional profiles found in each size fraction were 
highly similar (Supplementary Figure S1) and, 
therefore, we pooled all reads after normalizing for 
sequencing depth for subsequent analyses, which 
allows for a better comparison of metagenomes. 
The functional analyses focused on the three main 
biogeochemical cycles for this type of lakes, that is, 
carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) cycling. The 
genetic potential of the microbial community was 
analyzed following the C, N, and S marker genes 
(KOs) as reported by Lauro et al. (2011) with a few 
modifications. We amended this previous rubric by 
adding the anaerobic carbon fixation carried out 
through the Calvin cycle by Chromatiaceae, and 
additional genes for polysulfide reduction, nitrate 
reduction and nitrite oxidation. In addition, the 
genes pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (porA/B) 
were not considered as marker genes for fermenta-
tion as in Lauro et al. (2011), because they are key 
genes in the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle used for 
carbon fixation by Epsilonproteobacteria abundant 
in our study lakes (Campbell and Cary, 2004; Takai 
et al., 2005). Because both sulfide oxidation and 
dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathways are 
mediated by the same set of genes (aprA, aprB and 
dsrA) but are found in different families of bacteria, 
we assigned metagenomic reads to each pathway 
according to phylogeny, that is, sulfate reduction for 
Firmicutes and Deltaproteobacteria reads, and sul-
fide oxidation for Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteo-
bacteria, Chlorobiaceae and Chromatiaceae. Finally, 
for the sulfur-oxidizing Epsilonproteobacteria of the 
order Campylobacterales we specifically searched 
for sox genes (coding for thiosulfate oxidation) not 
currently available in the KEGG database. Marker 
genes used in the present work are shown 
in Supplementary Table S1. Hierarchical clus-
tering and heatmap plots were generated with 
R (R Development Core Team, 2012) using the

<p>Our beat synchronization task was based on Kirshner and Tomasello's (2009) social 
drumming entrainment paradigm for preschoolers. The experimenter sat across from the 
child with two conga drums between them, one for the experimenter and one for the 
participant. Each conga had a Pulse Percussion DR-1 drum trigger attached to the underside 
of its drumhead to record the drum hits and convert vibrations into voltage in real time with 
no delay. The experimenter covertly listened and drummed to an isochronous beat presented 
through an in-ear headphone and encouraged the child to imitate and drum along with the 
experimenter. Auditory stimuli and drum hits of both the experimenter and participant were 
recorded as two separate two-channel recordings in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Audacity</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 2.0.5</rs>. Four trials were 
performed: two trials at 2.5 Hz followed by two trials at 1.67 Hz. Each trial was 20 s in </p>

<p>2.2.1. Data processing-Synchronization data were processed using software developed 
in house in <rs id="software-2" type="software">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Mathworks, Inc.</rs>., Natick, MA). Due to the high intersubject 
variability in intensity and rapidity of drumming, drum hits for the experimenter and 
participant were detected by setting an amplitude threshold and a refractory period on a 
participant-by-participant basis. The first point at which the signal exceeded the amplitude 
threshold was marked as a hit, immediately followed by a refractory period during which the 
program did not mark peaks (to ensure multiple points were not marked for each hit). 
Accuracy of automated hit detection was checked manually to ensure onsets were correctly 
marked for each hit. </p>

<p>(Klatt, 1980). Stimuli differed only in onset frequency of the second formant (F 2 ; [ba] = 900 
Hz, [da] = 1700 Hz, [ga] = 2480 Hz), shifting to 1240 Hz for the steady-state vowel. Over 
the transition period for all stimuli the first and third formants were dynamic (F 1 = 400-720 
Hz, F 3 = 2580-2500 Hz) with the fundamental frequency, fourth, fifth, and sixth formants 
constant (F 0 = 100, F 4 = 3300, F 5 =3750, and F 6 = 4900 Hz). All stimuli were presented in 
alternating polarities (stimulus waveform was inverted 180°) with an interstimulus interval 
of 81 ms controlled by <rs id="software-3" type="software">E-Prime</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">version 2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Psychology Software Tools, Inc.</rs>., Sharpsburg, 
PA). Each stimulus was presented 4200 times, with presentation order randomized for each 
participant. </p>

<p>2.3.2. Recording parameters-Stimuli were presented monaurally to the right ear 
through an insert earphone (ER-3, Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, IL) while the 
participant sat watching a movie of their choice in a sound-attenuated booth (IAC Acoustics, 
Bronx, NY). The left ear remained unblocked so that the soundtrack of the movie (&lt;40 dB 
SPL) was audible but not loud enough to mask presented stimuli. FFRs were collected using 
BioSEMI Active2 with an ActiABR module recorded in <rs id="software-5" type="software">LabView</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">National Instruments</rs>, Austin, TX). Responses were digitized at 16.384 kHz and collected with an 
online bandpass filter from 100 to 3000 Hz (20 dB/decade roll-off). The active electrode was 
placed at the vertex (Cz), with references on each earlobe. Grounding electrodes CMS and 
DRL were placed on the forehead at Fp1 and Fp2, respectively. Only ipsilateral-referenced 
(Cz-Right earlobe) responses were used in analyses. Offset voltage was &lt;50 mV for all 
electrodes. </p>

<p>2.3.3. Data reduction and processing-FFRs to speech stimuli were offline amplified 
in the frequency domain 20 dB per decade for 3 decades below 100 Hz, bandpass filtered 
from 70 to 2000 Hz (12 dB/octave roll-off), segmented into epochs with an interval of −40 
to 210 ms (in relation to the stimulus onset), and baseline-corrected to the pre-stimulus 
period. Responses exceeding ±35 µV were rejected as artifacts and remaining sweeps were 
averaged. Final responses to each syllable comprised 2000 artifact-free sweeps of each 
polarity, and responses to the two polarities were added to accentuate the response to the 
speech envelope (Aiken and Picton, 2008) and limit the influence of cochlear microphonic 
and stimulus artifact (Campbell et al., 2012). Data reduction occurred in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> using 
custom scripts. </p>

<p>samplings of trials, and the 300 correlation values were averaged to generate a final measure 
of intertrial neural response stability. Neural stability for encoding the click stimulus was 
assessed over 0 to 11.95 ms of the response using the same methodology: the two sub-
averaged waveforms (1000 randomly selected, averaged trials) were correlated to determine 
similarity 100 times, each with different random samplings of trials, and the correlation 
values were averaged. To specifically examine the timing variability in frequency encoding 
of the 170 ms speech-evoked FFR, intertrial phase-locking (Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b) 
was calculated in 20 Hz windows surrounding the fundamental frequency of the stimulus 
(100 Hz) and its harmonics up to 1000 Hz. Time-frequency spectrum was calculated using a 
short-time fast Fourier transform that resulted in a matrix containing two measures for each 
time × frequency point: a vector length (the extent to which each frequency is encoded in the 
FFR) and phase (the timing of that frequency). To specifically analyze the timing variability, 
each vector was transformed into a unit vector. For each frequency, the 4000 vectors were 
averaged and the length of the resulting vector was calculated as a measure of the 
consistency of phase across trials. Low frequency phase-locking was captured by averaging 
across the vectors for 100, 200, 300, and 400 Hz, while high frequency phase-locking was 
computed as a mean of the vectors for harmonics 500-1000 Hz. Intertrial neural stability 
and phase-locking correlation values were Fisher and log transformed to conform to the 
expectations of a linear model (normality and sphericity). Data analysis occurred in 
<rs type="software">MATLAB</rs>. </p>

<p>Pearson correlations were used to compare intertrial neural stability and phase-locking 
across stimuli (mean of [ba] + [da] + [ga]) to beat synchronization consistency. Phase-
locking was averaged across low-frequency harmonics (100-400 Hz) and high-frequency 
harmonics (500-1000 Hz). Hierarchical two-step linear regressions were employed to 
determine how neural stability and phase-locking predicted variance in beat synchronization 
over and above demographic factors. Statistics were computed using <rs id="software-9" type="software">SPSS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">SPSS, Inc.</rs>., 
Chicago, IL). </p>

<p>Two authors (KC and CC), who were not blinded to the 
names of authors and institutions, screened the search results 
and selected relevant trials independently. One author (CC) 
extracted data from the relevant trials and used the Cochrane 
Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias to evaluate the 
quality of the included trials. 
19 Another author (KC) checked 
the data and quality assessment. Disagreement was resolved by 
discussion, with a third author available for arbitration (SW). 
We conducted a meta-analysis to obtain the pooled inter-
vention effect estimates. We expressed the estimates as mean 
difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continu-
ous outcomes, and as risk difference (RD) and 95% CI for 
dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the I 
2 statistic to assess 
the degree of statistical heterogeneity across the included trials. 
A fixe-model was applied when there was no or low hetero-
geneity (I 
2 &lt; 50%), while a random-effects model was applied 
when there was substantial heterogeneity (I 
2 ! 50%). 
19 We used 
the Review Manager <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">The Nordic Cochrane Centre</rs>, The 
Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2012) for

This study used published data and thus ethical approval 
was not necessary. </p>

<p>We calculated rate ratios comparing rates in the community, 
presenting to the GP and reported to national surveillance. We 
assumed that the rates came from a log-normal distribution 
with the observed mean and SD. The rate ratios were estimated 
by simulating 100 000 random draws from each pair of rate 
distributions. We took the median, 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of 
the resulting RR distribution as the point estimate and lower 
and upper 95% confidence limits. 
Finally, we applied the estimated rates to the mid-2009 UK 
population estimate to calculate the annual number of cases and 
GP consultations associated with each organism. 
Multiple imputation was conducted in <rs id="software-1" type="software">R</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">2.11</rs>. Analysis of 
under-ascertainment and analysis of imputed data were

respectively. </p>

<p>Cost data were obtained from the financial records used for 
routine financial and management reporting of the NGOs, LPs 
and foundation office in Delhi, as well as staff records and 
interviews with staff. For the detailed costing sites, details of 
donated goods and services were collected from the project. The 
economic costs of these items were valued at market prices 
obtained from local shops and interviews with project staff. 
Process output and outcome data were extracted from the 
management information system (MIS) of the project and 
project reports. All data were entered into a specifically designed 
<rs type="software">MS Excel</rs> workbook. </p>

<p>Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to give an initial 
insight into the causes of the variation in average cost between 
local implementing NGOs. The analysis explored the relation-
ship of cost per person registered with scale, high-risk group 
(MSM/TG or FSW), age of intervention, number of Avahan 
NGOs in the district, whether the NGO was in a metropolitan 
area, number of LPs in the state and by LPs by adding each 
variable progressively into the model. The regression was carried 
out using <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> (SPSS, Chicago). </p>

<p>Combination proliferation assay. The cytotoxic effect of 
TMZ or/and MET on GSCs was measured by cell counting 
kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Briefly, U87 and C6 gliospheres were 
cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates (5x10 
3 per 100 µl per 
well) in NBM with B27, N2, glutaMAX, 2 µg/ml heparin 
and 20 ng/ml EGF+bFGF at 37˚C for 24 h, then different 
concentrations of TMZ (0-3.2 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) or MET 
(0-160 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) were added and compared with 
the DMSO-treated control. The CCK-8 reagent (10 µl/well) 
was added at 93 h, and the OD was measured at 450 nm after 
96 h using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader 
(BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). In order to determine the 
combination cytotoxic effect on GSCs, parallel studies were 
performed in cells treated with TMZ (0-3.2 mmol) plus MET 
(0-160 mmol) (1:50, TMZ:MET). The combination index 
(CI) value was analyzed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">CalcuSyn</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version2</rs>; 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Biosoft</rs>, Cambridge, UK) and calculated by the Chou-Talalay 
method (25). CI values &lt;1.0, =1, and &gt;1.0 indicates synergistic 
interaction (more than additive), summation (additive), and 
antagonistic interaction (less than additive), respectively. </p>

<p>100 µg/ml of RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 37˚C 
for 30 min. Then the cells stained with 100 µg/ml of prop-
idium iodide (PI, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4˚C for another 30 min in 
darkness. The percentage of cells at different cell cycle stages 
(G0/G1, G2/M and S phase) was determined on the basis of 
DNA content by flow cytometer using <rs id="software-1" type="software">ModFit LT</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">3.3</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Verity Software House, Inc.</rs>., Topsham, ME, USA). </p>

<p>Apoptosis assay. To determine the effect of TMZ or/and MET 
on GSCs apoptosis, U87 and C6 gliospheres were cultured in 
NBM with B27, N2, glutaMAX, 2 µg/ml heparin and 20 ng/ml 
EGF+bFGF in the absence or presence of 0.4 mmol TMZ, 
20 mmol MET or 0.4 mmol TMZ plus 20 mmol MET in 5% 
CO 2 incubator at 37˚C. After 48 h, the GSCs were collected. 
Apoptotic and necrotic cell death was analyzed by double 
staining with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated 
annexin V and PI, in which annexin V bound to the early and 
late apoptotic cells with membrane-exposed phosphatidyl-
serine, while PI labeled only the late apoptotic/necrotic cells 
with membrane damage. Staining was performed using the 
FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen, 
San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. The stained cells were analyzed with a BD FACSAria III 
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). 
The numbers of viable (annexin V-/PI-), apoptotic (annexin 
V+/PI-), and necrotic (annexin V+/PI+) cells were calculated 
with the <rs id="software-2" type="software">FACSDiva</rs> software, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 6.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">BD Biosciences</rs>). </p>

<p>cluded. In all the cases, periodontitis diagnosis was based on 
the 1999 classification of the American Academy of Periodon-
tology (AAP) [1] and clinical and radiographic parameters. The 
localized or generalized type of periodontitis is not consid-
ered in this study but only the main form. 
The following chart entries were used in this study: gender, 
age, risk factors (like smoking or presence or absence of dia-
betes mellitus), use of a toothbrush for oral hygiene, attach-
ment loss, probing depth, number of teeth with a probing 
depth of 3 to 4 mm and ≥ 5 mm, number of teeth with an at-
tachment loss of 3 to 4 mm and ≥ 5 mm, tooth mobility, tooth 
loss, and maximum alveolar bone loss. William's periodontal 
probe (Michigan O probe, Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co., Chicago, IL, 
USA) was the main instrument used at the Clinic of Periodon-
tics of UCAD to assess attachment loss and probing depth. 
Assessment of the periodontal supporting tissues' status was 
based on clinical measurement of the distance from the ce-
mento-enamel junction or free gingival margin to the bot-
tom of pocket/sulcus at 4 or 6 sites per tooth (according to 
the charting sheet design at UCAD). Tooth mobility was as-
sessed using the Mühlemann index [21]. The alveolar bone 
loss was quantified on panoramic radiographs using the Bjorn 
technique for assessment of alveolar bone level as described 
by Albandar and Abbas [22]. In Bjorn's technique, the distance 
between the alveolar crest and the crown tip of the tooth was 
expressed as a proportion of the total length of the tooth. A 
lens displaying 2X magnification was fixed to a light screen 
and used to examine all radiographs. In this study, the alveo-
lar bone loss is expressed as a percentage by measurement 
on the proximal faces of the most affected tooth and corre-
sponded to the distance from the cemento-enamel junction 
to the bottom of the bone lesion reported to the distance be-
tween cemento-enamel junction and the apex. The measure-
ments were made by a single operator (S.Y.) using a transpar-
ent millimeter ruler and a dry-tipped compass. The reliability 
of measurements was tested on 50 images from randomly 
selected files, using the calculation of the intraclass correla-
tion coefficient. The threshold of 60% (95% confidence in-
terval) was considered sufficient in this study to conclude 
good agreement measures (usual threshold &gt; 70%) because 
of the non-uniform quality of the radiographs. The 3rd mo-
lars were excluded in this study. 
The records of 2,274 periodontal patients from the Service 
of Periodontics at UCAD were reviewed for this study. Only 
periodontitis patients were included (n = 637). Of these, 73 
(11.5%) were excluded because their charts were unusable or 
X-rays were absent or unreadable (conservation defects). Thus, 
564 records met the selection criteria including 413 chronic 
periodontitis (73.2%) and 151 aggressive periodontitis (26.8%).

inferior lateral meniscus of each eye, and the mean value 
of both eyes was used for the statistical analysis. Tear os-
molarity ≥316 mOsm/L has been reported to identify dry 
eye disease with high sensitivity, specificity, and predictive 
accuracy [11]. 
A 5-minute Schirmer I test (without anesthesia) was per-
formed before instillation of any eye drops. The standard-
ized Schirmer test strip (Eagle Vision, Memphis, TN, 
USA) was bent and placed at the inferior outer fornix. 
Each patient was instructed to keep his/her eyes closed 
during the test. The length of maximal wetting was mea-
sured after 5 minutes. A Schirmer test value ≤5 mm was 
considered abnormal. 
To measure tear film break-up time, we placed a fluores-
cein-impregnated strip in the lateral part of inferior fornix. 
Each patient was asked to blink, and the time before the 
corneal dry spot appeared in the stained tear film was re-
corded as the tear film break-up time. Tear film break-up 
time ≤5 seconds was considered abnormal. 
Corneal and conjunctival staining was evaluated after 
fluorescein staining under a yellow-barrier filter and cobalt 
blue illumination. Corneal and conjunctival staining was 
graded according to the Sjögren's International Collabora-
tive Clinical Alliance ocular staining score (OSS) [23].

<p>system. The Bitcoin Blockchain consists of a sequence of blocks where each block builds on 
its predecessors and contains information about new Bitcoin transactions. The average time 
between Bitcoin blocks is 10 minutes. The first block, block #0, was created in 2009; and, at 
the time of this writing, block #494600 was appended as the most recent block to the chain. 
Because everyone can download and read the Bitcoin Blockchain, it is a public record, a ledger 
that contains Bitcoin ownership information for any point in time. 
The word "ledger" has to be qualified here. There is no single instance of the Bitcoin 
Blockchain. Instead, every participant is free to manage his or her own copy of the ledger. 
As it was with the stone money, there is no central authority with an exclusive right to keep 
accounts. Instead, there is a predefined set of rules and the opportunity for individuals to 
monitor that other participants adhere to the rules. The notion of "public record of ownership" 
also has to be qualified because the owners of Bitcoin units usually remain anonymous through 
the use of pseudonyms. 
To use the Bitcoin system, an agent downloads a Bitcoin wallet. A <rs type="software">Bitcoin wallet</rs> is soft-
ware that allows the receiving, storing, and sending of (fractions of) Bitcoin units. 3 The next 
step is to exchange fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, for Bitcoin units. The most common 
way is to open an account at one of the many Bitcoin exchanges and to transfer fiat currency 
to it. The account holder can then use these funds to buy Bitcoin units or one of the many 
other cryptoassets on the exchange. Due to the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, the pricing 
on large exchanges is very competitive with relatively small bid-ask spreads. Most exchanges 
provide order books and many other financial tools that make the trading process transparent. 
A Bitcoin transaction works in a way that is similar to a transaction in the Yap payment 
system. A buyer broadcasts to the network that a seller's Bitcoin address is the new owner of 
a specific Bitcoin unit. This information is distributed on the network until all nodes are 
informed about the ownership transfer. We will examine some technical details of this step 
in Section 2. 
For a virtual currency to function, it is crucial to establish at every point in time how 
many monetary units exist, as well as how many new units have been created. There must 
also be a consensus mechanism that ensures that all participants agree about the ownership 
rights to the virtual currency units. In small communities, as with the Yap islanders, everyone 
knows everyone else. The participants care about their reputation, and conflicts can be dis-
puted directly. In contrast, within the Bitcoin system the number of participants is substan-
tially larger, and network participants can remain anonymous. Consequently, reputation 
effects cannot be expected to have a significant positive impact, and coordination becomes 
very difficult. Instead, there is a consensus mechanism that allows the Bitcoin system to reach 
an agreement. This consensus mechanism is the core innovation of the Bitcoin system and 
allows consensus to be reached on a larger scale and in the absence of any personal relations. </p>

<p>ruminating in 24 hours, respectively. The variables g of DM 
and NDF/cud were obtained by dividing the average 
individual intake of each fraction by the number of 
ruminated cuds per day (in 24 hours). 
The results were analyzed by variance analysis and 
regression equations, using the Analysis System of the 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">System Analysis and Statistical Genetics</rs> package (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2001</rs>). </p>

<p>Pre-operative planning for tumour resection. Pre-operative 
bone CT and MRI scans are obtained respectively for 
CT with 0.5 mm spacing between slices and 1 mm 
slice thickness, and for MRI according to the resolution 
needed for diagnosis. The open-source software <rs id="software-3" type="software">ITK-
Snap</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">2.0.0</rs> 35 is used to manually delineate the tumour 
on each MRI slice where it is visible. </p>

<p>The data for each variable were tested using the 
D' Agostino &amp; Pearson normality test. The mean and 
standard deviation or median and range were determined. 
Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney test was performed as 
appropriate. All analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">GraphPad</rs>

<p>Records from patients who had undergone diagnostic paranasal 
HRCT scans at our clinic between March 2010 and March 2011 
were examined retrospectively for this study. Patients with trau-
matic, neoplastic, or inflammatory lesions that destroyed the 
wall of the orbit were excluded. One hundred patients (38 males 
and 62 females, 200 sides) were involved in our study. The ages 
of the patients were between 19 and 78 years, with an average 
of 48 years. This study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of the Catholic Medical Center Clinical Research Coordi-
nating Center. 
HRCT scans were performed in 0.69 mm slices with a CT scan-
ner (Sensation 16, Siemens Medical Systems, Munich, Germa-
ny). After the imaging data were stored in a Digital Imaging and 
Communication in Medicine (<rs type="software">DICOM</rs>) file, they were imported 
to a personal computer. All scanning was performed at constant 
window level and width settings of 300 and 330 H, because ev-
ery change in the window level and width settings resulted in 
deviating values with respect to the muscle size on CT scan. The 
coronal reconstructions were modified using <rs id="software-1" type="software">3D-DOCTOR</rs> soft-
ware (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Able Software Co.</rs>., Lexington, MA, USA), so that the na-
sal floor in the coronal and sagittal planes was horizontal. Se-
quential coronal planes were observed using <rs type="software">3D-DOCTOR</rs> soft-
ware and simultaneous multiplanar reconstructions in bone al-
gorithm format were reconstructed in the axial and sagittal planes. 
The positions of the coronal plane on which the measurements 
were taken were defined as the AE (anterior wall of bulla eth-
moidalis that was removed first during anterior ethmoidecto-
my), BL (the basal lamella through which posterior ethmoidec-
tomy was performed), and PE (the midportion of the posterior </p>

<p>of the extraconal fat pad between the EOM and orbital wall ad-
jacent to the AE (Fig. 1). 
To evaluate the position of the trochlea of the SO, the rela-
tionship between the trochlea and the opening of the frontal si-
nus (FO) was assessed in the parasagittal plane. The imaginary 
point, which was equivalent to the position of the trochlea coro-
nally and axially, was drawn in the parasagittal plane, which was 
equivalent to the midportion of the FO. The vertical distance 
from the frontal beak to imaginary point, anteroposterior dis-
tance from the anterior wall of the frontal sinus to imaginary 
point, and anteroposterior distance from the frontal beak to 
imaginary point were measured in the parasagittal plane. In ad-
dition, the horizontal distance from the midline to the trochlea 
was measured in the coronal plane, where the trochlea was iden-
tified (Fig. 4). Statistical analysis was done using <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">ver. 18</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical comparisons between 
genders and laterality were performed using t-test. Pearson's 
correlations were applied to define the relationship of the mea-
surements with aging. A P-value of less than 0.05 was consid-
ered significant. </p>

<p>2.4.3. Estimation of within-submarket spatial weight. What remains now is to estimate 
the within-submarket spatial weight v 0 . Since dwellings within a submarket are in 
general located closer to each other than those across different submarkets, it is 
expected that v 0 will be large compared to the cross-submarket spatial weights. We 
propose maximum likelihood to conduct this estimation. Specifically, for any 
candidate value of v 0 , we construct the corresponding row-standardized spatial 
weights matrix W, estimate the spatial error model using maximum likelihood, and 
evaluate the value of the maximized likelihood. In this way, we construct spatial 
weights matrices using various candidate values for v 0 , estimate the corresponding 
spatial error models by maximum likelihood using <rs id="software-4" type="software">Geoda</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Anselin</rs>, 2005), and 
maximize the likelihood over all such candidate values. Standard errors are 
estimated by numerical approximation to compute the Fisher information at this 
maximized value for v 0 . </p>

<p>positive spatial autocorrelation; and highÁlow (lower right) or lowÁhigh (upper 
left), for negative spatial autocorrelation. Positive spatial autocorrelation implies 
that a high (low) value in the current location is surrounded by high (low) values in 
neighbouring observations. The slope of the best-fitting regression line is Moran's I 
statistic (Anselin, 2005). While Moran's I index is useful for detecting the presence 
of spatial autocorrelation, it does not indicate the precise structure of spatial 
interactions (Anselin, 2005). 
Based on the above measures of contiguity or distance, Moran's statistics tend to 
be positive but are not significant, showing little evidence of spatial autocorrelation 
in housing prices. Taking this evidence on face value, we would be tempted to 
conclude that geographically adjacent observations have little or no influence on 
house prices*a rather unsatisfactory observation. 
Next, we used the <rs id="software-5" type="software">GEODA</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Anselin</rs>, 2005; Anselin et al., 2006) to 
perform a series of Lagrange Multipliers (LM) tests (Anselin, 2005) for both spatial 
lag dependence and spatial error dependence. Specifically, in addition to OLS, we 
estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) alternative spatial regression models and 
investigated whether a spatial error or a spatial lag model, or indeed a model </p>

<p>Sample size in each study was established by defining 
values for the number of patients required to detect a clini-
cally significant difference in the study's primary efficacy 
measure. Analyses of rescue opioid use were performed on 
the combined intent-to-treat population from both studies 
using Statistical Analysis System (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., Cary, 
NC, USA) version 9.1 or later. Pooled data are presented as 
mean ± standard deviation (SD), unless otherwise noted. 
Data were analyzed for the pooled study population, as well 
as subgroups based on dose (HPβCD-diclofenac 18.75, 
37.5, and 50 mg), baseline pain (moderate or severe, based 
on 0-100 mm VAS), and age (&lt;65 and ≥65 years). P-values 
for demographic data were calculated using analysis of vari-
ance for numerical variables and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test for categorical variables. P-values for efficacy outcomes 
(rescue opioid use; HPβCD-diclofenac and ketorolac vs 
placebo; HPβCD-diclofenac vs ketorolac) were calculated 
using least-square mean difference based on an analysis of 
covariance model with treatment, study, and center as factors 
and baseline pain as a covariate. </p>

<p>All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, where 
applicable. Differences in mean IOP at baseline and at 1 and 
3 months were analyzed using paired t-tests. Commercially 
available statistical software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 22</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA</rs>) was used to perform all statistical analy-
ses. Statistical significance was defined as P,0.05. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs><rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">16.0</rs> 
statistical software. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed 
continuous variables to be normal, so parametric tests 
were used. An ANOVA was performed followed by Schef-
fé's method to compare 3 groups (NNS, pre-feeding oral 
stimulation and control group) for the gestational age 
at different stage of oral feeding. Repeated measures 
ANOVA were performed to analyze intra-group changes. 
A MANOVA was performed to compare the weight gains 
from birth through weeks between three groups. Statisti-
cal significance was considered at α = 0.05. </p>

<p><rs type="software">STRUCTURE</rs><rs type="software">STRUCTURE</rs><rs type="software">GENALEX</rs>subpopulations is a measure of the number of population sub-
groups in the data set. Analyses were run as described (Mellanby 
and others 2013) using the results for 15 microsatellite markers, 
and both South African dogs and the UK dogs previously 
reported by Mellanby and others (2013) were included. Fig 1 
shows the outcome of this analysis when K (number of contrib-
uting subpopulations) was set at 6. The result was the same 
with higher values of K. This analysis showed that within a 
breed the dogs were genetically very similar regardless of the 
country. Jack Russell terriers showed equal contributions from 
different subpopulations, whereas labrador retrievers and 
German shepherd dogs each showed 90 per cent contribution 
from a single subpopulation. Jack Russell terriers had very little 
contribution from either of the subpopulations predominant in </p>

<p>the labrador retrievers or German shepherd dogs, as might be 
expected given the very different phenotype and ancestry of 
these dogs. The admixture of subpopulations within a breed was 
the same regardless of country, showing that the breeds have not 
diverged greatly. To further test this, each breed was subjected 
individually to <rs type="software">STRUCTURE</rs> analysis. There was no evidence of 
stratification based on country of origin at K=2 or higher 
K values (Fig 2). As previously reported (Mellanby and others 
2013), misclassification of dog breed was common with four of 
the South African labrador retrievers and one of the German 
shepherd dogs showing mixed breed ancestry, whereas several 
others had a 50 per cent contribution from one subpopulation 
suggesting a one parent of the associated breed and one of 
another breed or mixed breed background. </p>

<p>FIG 1: STRUCTURE analysis of three dog breeds from the UK and South Africa. Genotypes for 15 microsatellites for dogs of all three breeds 
from South Africa and the UK were entered into the program <rs type="software">STRUCTURE</rs> and the analysis run with a burn-in period of 100,000 replications 
and a run of 500,000 replications (Mellanby and others 2013). Runs were repeated between two and five times for each value of K to assess 
the stability of the population structure detected. The results are shown for a typical run with K=6. Each vertical column represents a different 
dog, whereas the shades of grey represent six different subpopulations in the admixture. The y axis shows the proportional of the genotype 
attributed to each subpopulation for each dog </p>

<p>FIG 2: <rs type="software">STRUCTURE</rs> analysis within dog breeds from the UK and South Africa. The input data were the same as for Fig 1, but the input 
contained only the results for a single breed. Burn-in, run and replications were the same as for Fig 1. Results are shown for K=2. The relative 
proportion of each population in each dog is shown in dark and light grey.; the outcome was similar for higher values of K </p>

<p>Original trace analysis (done and then com-
pared with the method described here) 
was performed using a custom-written <rs id="software-6" type="software">Lab-
View</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">National Instruments</rs>, Austin, TX) 
software code similar to previously de-
scribed procedures (Pitchiaya et al., 2012, 
2013). In short, the <rs type="software">LabView</rs> code uses 
noise-filtering and photon-counting histo-
gram algorithms to identify particles of in-
terest and removes nonuniform back-
ground from all selected traces. The data 
were filtered further by a nonlinear Chung-
Kennedy noise filter to preserve fast and 
sudden signal transitions while averaging 
out random noise. The filtered data were 
then assessed by eye, with each sudden 
decrease in signal classified as a photo-
bleaching event. For each trace, the num-
ber of photobleaching events corresponds 
to the total fluorescent miR-7 molecules 
within a focus since &gt;90% of dye molecules 
are found to be fluorescent (Pitchiaya et al., 
2012, 2013). </p>

<p>To test the photobleaching event count-
ing method described here in a biological 
context, we conducted a single-molecule 
photobleaching analysis to test the oligo-
merization state of transfected fluores-
cent miR-7 duplex in fixed HeLa cells. Six 
hours after transfection, our cells were 
fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, 
immersed in OSS, and illuminated using 
HILO fluorescence microscopy. Videos 
of single cells were acquired until all cel-
lular fluorescent particles were photo-
bleached into a permanent dark state. 
The original analysis was performed as 
described; via our custom <rs type="software">LabView</rs> software, fluorescent parti-
cles were identified and background subtracted. Then noise was 
filtered to help identify by eye intensity transitions relevant to 
the photobleaching process. The results of this original analysis 
method were then compared with the results we acquired by 
first using the <rs type="software">Lab View</rs> code just to select areas of interest and 
then processing the traces with our full Bayesian code. </p>

<p>The software package <rs id="software-1" type="software">AMOS</rs> (Analysis of Moment 
Structures) by <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Arbuckle</rs> (2006) was used to analyse 
the data. Initially, a test of multivariate normality was 
conducted and, as a result, six observations were 
removed. These observations had Mahalanobis dis-
tance values that deviated significantly from the 
other observations 
3 -their removal resulted in a 
sample size of 504. 
The manifest variables were tested to evaluate if the 
correlations amongst measures validated them as 
indicators of the underlying constructs. Initially, 
each construct was developed and analysed separately. 
The squared multiple correlations and the standar-
dized regression weights were used to assess the 
strength of the correlations between the constructs 
and the manifest variables. If the standardized regres-
sion weights exceed 0.3 they are generally considered 
to be adequate measures of the construct (Loxton 
2011). In total, four items were removed from the </p>

<p>Behavioural analysis. Behavioural analysis was performed to assess 
the development of tactile allodynia in mice. Tactile allodynia was measured using 
a von Frey filament (North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA, USA). Mice were placed in 
glass cages with a wire mesh bottom and allowed to habituate for at least 1 h. A 
von Frey filament with bending forces of 0.16 g (innocuous stimulation) was 
pressed perpendicularly against the plantar skin of a hind-paw. The paw 
withdrawal responses to the mechanical stimulus were evaluated by scoring as 
follows: 0, no response; 1, lifting the hind-paw within 3 s; 2, lifting the hind-paw 
over 3 s; and 3, immediate flinching or licking of the hind-paw. The stimulation of 
the same intensity was applied seven times to each hind-paw at several seconds 
intervals and the total served as the pain-related score (score) in the SNL model. 
The behavioural data were analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Origin</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microcal software Inc.</rs>., 
Sunnyvale, MA, USA) software to determine the IC 50 values. 
We performed a rota-rod (KN-75 Rota-rod, Natume, Japan) test to measure 
motor balance and coordination. Mice were pre-trained on rota-rod apparatus for 3 
days and then tested on the accelerating rod in which the speed of the spindle was 
10 r.p.m. Latency until fall was automatically recorded. To eliminate stress and 
fatigue, mice were given a maximum cutoff latency of 120 s. </p>

<p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from substantia gelatinosa 
neurons. The substantia gelatinosa was easily discernible with transmitted 
illumination as a relatively translucent band across the dorsal horn in the 
transverse or parasagittal slice preparations. Blind whole-cell voltage-clamp 
recordings were made from SG neurons, as previously described. 
53,54 The patch 
pipettes were filled with potassium gluconate solution, a solution containing (in 
mM); 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, and 
5 ATP-Mg (pH 7.2). The tip resistance of the patch pipettes was 6-12 MO. Series 
resistance was assessed from current in response to a 5-mV hyperpolarizing step. 
Series resistance was monitored during the recording session and data were 
rejected if its value changed by 415%. Ion currents were monitored with a patch-
clamp amplifier (Axopatch 700A, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The 
data were digitized with an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1321A, Molecular 
Devices), stored on a personal computer using a data acquisition program 
(<rs id="software-1" type="software">Clampex</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 10</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>) and analyzed using a software package 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">Clampfit</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 10</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>). Recordings were made in a voltage-
clamp mode at holding potential of À 70 mV to isolate EPSCs. Drugs were 
dissolved in the Krebs solution and applied by superfusion. </p>

<p>Analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">NONMEM</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v7.2.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">ICON Development Solutions</rs>, MD, USA). The different tissues 
(tear, naso-lacrymal duct, cornea, aqueous humor) were 
considered as different compartments. Because of its 
physiology, each eye was considered as an individual [8, 
9]. So, a total of 84 individuals were considered in the 
dataset. </p>

<p>In addition to the global multi-compartmental structure, 
many model configurations were tested, e.g., first-order rate 
constant or inter-compartmental clearance between the 
different compartments, a drug cleared or not from the 
naso-lacrymal duct, a drug cleared or not from the cornea, 
either fixed volumes of distribution at known physiological 
values to avoid an over-parameterization of the model or 
let free to be estimated by <rs type="software">NONMEM</rs>. Regarding the 
nanosuspension formulation, two kinetics of administration 
situations were tested for nanosuspensions (1) administra-
tion with zero-order kinetic in the tear, in this case it would 
allow estimating the duration of the nanosuspension dis-
solution in the tear or (2) administration as a bolus as it was 
done for the solution. In the last case, the only way to take 
into account the formulation was to test it as a binary 
covariate on the relevant model parameters. The estimation 
of inter-individual variability (g) was evaluated using 
either a constant coefficient variation (CV) or proportional 
error model. The full non diagonal matrix (x-block) and 
the different combinations of g correlations were evaluated 
as well as the possibility to fix some x 
2 to zero. The 
selection of a x-block, if any, was made on the basis of the 
objective function value (OFV) decrease. Many algorithms 
were tested only one by one or by a combination. Given the 
complexity of the current model and the multi-compart-
mental structure, several differential equation solvers were 
evaluated. The model selection was performed on the basis </p>

<p>Statistical significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05. All statistical 
analyses were performed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SAS, Inc.</rs>., Cary,

<p>enrichment pools, effi ciency of enrichment was evaluated using two relative 
qPCR assays (qPCR primers, thermocycler profi le, and other information in 
Appendix S1). Enriched samples that amplifi ed at least 10 cycles earlier than 
unenriched samples (&gt;1000-fold enrichment assuming 100% primer effi ciency) 
were considered successful. 
Target-enriched library pools were again pooled and diluted for sequencing 
on an Illumina MiSeq (W. Harry Feinstone Center for Genomic Research, 
University of Memphis, Tennessee; 500-cycle kit, Illumina V2 chemistry). The 
<rs type="software">MiSeq</rs> controller software was set to trim adapters and deconvolute barcodes; 
the raw output has been uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology In-
formation (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (accession SRP057104). Read end 
trimming was performed in Trimmomatic 0.33 ( Bolger et al., 2014 ) with a slid-
ing window of 20 bp and a quality score of Q20 or greater. </p>

<p>use of BioSamples identifiers in other repositories to 
identify and link equivalent samples. 
Several major research projects have established links 
with the BioSamples database. For example, the HipSci 
project (http://www.hipsci.org/) pre-register information 
about donors and cell lines, including the relationships 
between them, with BioSamples database. The 
ENCODE (12) data coordination centre is working with 
BioSamples database to ensure their existing sample 
records are updated and annotated with ontology terms 
and in specifying relationships between samples in 
ENCODE datasets. To date sample information from 
users is submitted directly to the BioSamples database 
through both manual and automatic processes, both of 
which are supported by the curatorial staff. 
Other locations around the world have also established 
repositories of sample information, including the NCBI 
BioSample database. The BioSamples database at EBI is 
using a common accessioning scheme previously agreed 
with NCBI and DDBJ, and we expect that data 
exchange will be implemented in early 2014. 
As sample data can be identified by multiple accessions 
assigned by EBI and external databases an identifier 
and URL resolution service '<rs type="software">MyEquivalents</rs>' has been 
deployed. It provides mapping between different, but 
equivalent, sample identifiers. For example, human 
RNA-Seq data deposited at EBI may have identifiers for 
ArrayExpress, ENA and BioSamples database as these 
resources share records. In time the BioSamples database 
identifier will be the only sample identifier for new sub-
missions, but until then, and to preserve backwards com-
patibility for legacy data, the <rs type="software">MyEquivalents</rs> service 
provides redirection URLs and web services describing </p>

<p>mappings. More information and the source code for the 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">MyEquivalents</rs> software is available (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/myequivalents</rs>). 
Finally, as a component of the EBI Resource 
Description Framework (RDF) platform (http://www. 
ebi.ac.uk/rdf) RDF is now available for the BioSamples 
database content. The schema is derived from the 
SampleTab format, supported by integration with 
existing ontologies such as the Ontology of Biomedical 
Investigations (13) and EFO. Data are made available as 
RDF and also for query via a SPARQL endpoint for 
which example queries are documented. </p>

<p>Yeast cultures were imaged after growth at 30°C to mid-log phase in 
synthetic defined media supplemented with either 2% glucose (SD 
plus glucose) or 2% galactose plus 2% raffinose (SD plus galactose/ 
raffinose; the latter for induction of Num1 CC , Pac1, or Kip2, as in-
dicated). To assess the effects of Num1 CC on localization of dynein 
pathway components, GAL1p:num1 CC cells were induced in SD plus 
galactose/raffinose for 6 h before mounting cells for fluorescence mi-
croscopy. For wide-field fluorescence microscopy, yeast cells were 
imaged on an agarose pad containing 50 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer, pH 7, and images were collected at room temperature using a 
1.49 NA 100× objective on a Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a 
Ti-S-E motorized stage (Nikon), piezo Z-control (Physik Instrumente), 
a SOLA SM II LE LED light engine (Lumencor), a motorized filter 
cube turret, and an iXon X3 DU897 cooled EM-CCD camera (Andor). 
The microscope system was controlled by <rs type="software">NIS-Elements</rs> software 
(Nikon). A step size of 1 µm was used to acquire 2-µm-thick Z-stack 
images. Sputtered/ET filter cube sets (Chroma Technology) were used 
for imaging mTurquoise2 (49001), GFP (49002), YFP (49003), and 
mCherry (49008) fluorescence. 
Image analysis was performed using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software (National 
Institutes of Health; kymographs in Fig. 7 were generated with the 
MultipleKymograph plugin). Plus end and SPB foci were identified 
in two (or three) color movies and scored accordingly. Specifically, 
plus end molecules were recognized as those foci that localized to the 
distal tips of dynamic microtubules (identified via mTurquoise2-Tub1 
imaging), whereas SPB molecules were recognized as those foci that 
localized to one of the spindle poles. Cortical molecules (e.g., in 
PH-Dyn1-expressing cells) were identified as those foci not associ-
ated with an astral microtubule plus end that remained stationary at 
the cell cortex for at least three frames. Two data sets were considered 
statistically significant if a Student's t test (assuming unequal vari-
ance) returned a p-value &lt; 0.05. 
For highly inclined and laminated optical sheet microscopy 
(Tokunaga et al., 2008), samples were prepared and imaged as above, 
except 488-and 561-nm lasers were used to excite YFP and mCherry, 
respectively. The laser illumination angle was adjusted individually for 
each sample to achieve the maximum signal-to-noise ratio. Emission 
filters were 525/50 nm for YFP and 600/50 for mCherry. </p>

<p>Sequence software analysis 
The nucleotide sequence of 1,287 samples aligned with 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">CLUSTAL W</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">European Bioinformatics Institute</rs>,

11 and the results acquired were 
and used for phylogenetic tree analysis after artificial 
adjustment. Reference sequence, which was downloaded 
from Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (Los Alamos 
National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA), was used to 
identify the subtype of obtained sequence; Genetic distance 
between sequences was assessed using the software MEGA 
<rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">3.1</rs> Kimura 2-parameter (Center for Evolutionary 
Functional Geromics The Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ,

<p>BioLabs, Beverly, MA) at 60°C for 2 hours, and products verified 
on a 3.5% agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The 
FCER1B -654C/T (rs574700) was genotyped using the TaqMan 
SNP Genotyping Assay. Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) 
was used to design the MGB TaqMan probes. One allelic probe 
was labeled with the fluorescent FAM dye and the other with 
the VIC dye. PCRs were run in a TaqMan universal master mix 
without UNG (Applied Biosystems) using PCR primer concen-
trations of 900 nM and TaqMan MGB-probe concentrations of 
200 nM. Reactions were performed in a 384-well format in a to-
tal reaction volume of 5 μL using 20 ng of genomic DNA. The 
plates then were placed in a thermal cycler (PE 9700; Applied 
Biosystems) and heated at 50°C for 2 minutes and 95°C for 10 
minutes followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C 
for 1 minutes, with a final soak at 25°C. The TaqMan assay plates 
were transferred to the Prism 7900HT instruments (Applied Bio-
systems), where the fluorescence intensity in each well of the 
plate was read. Fluorescence data files from each plate were an-
alyzed by automated allele-calling software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">SDS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">2.1</rs>). </p>

<p>Statistical analyses 
The clinical parameters (total IgE, PC20, total eosinophil count, 
FEV1 (%)) were analyzed according to the Kruskal-Wallis test 
among the four groups as shown in Table 1. To analyze the as-
sociation between the genotypes and asthma, we adopted a dom-
inant model since relatively few individuals were homozygous 
for the risk alleles. Since the age and sex displayed differences 
between controls and patients with asthma, a logistic regression 
analysis adjusted for age and sex was used to calculate the odds 
ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The rela-
tionship between clinical phenotypes and genotypes was test-
ed using the independent t-test; the analysis of increasing trend 
of aOR and log IgE was followed by a logistic and linear regres-
sion, respectively. All statistical analyses were performed using 
the <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">14.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL), and a P val-
ue of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>The bio-informatic tools for the prediction of MITS1 
targeting to mitochondria were <rs id="software-1" type="software">Predotar</rs> (Small et al., 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2004</rs>), <rs type="software">iPSORT</rs> and <rs type="software">PSORTII</rs> (Bannai et al., 2002), 
<rs type="software">MitoPred</rs> (Guda et al., 2004), and <rs type="software">SignalP</rs> (Nielsen et al., 
1997). The simulation of the Helical Wheel Projection of the 
MITS1 N-terminal was from http://rzlab.ucr.edu/scripts/ 
wheel/wheel.cgi (D Armstrong and R Zidovetzki). 
Imaging was performed using an upright Zeiss Laser 
Scanning Confocal Microscope LSM510 META (Zeiss, 
Jena, Germany) with a 363 water immersion objective. 
Transformed leaves were analysed 48 h after infection of the 
lower epidermis. For imaging expression of YFP constructs, 
GFP constructs or both, the imaging settings as described 
by Brandizzi et al. (2002) were used. Appropriate controls 
were used to exclude the possibility of energy transfer be-
tween fluorochromes and cross-talk. Images were acquired 
using non-saturating settings and the same imaging param-
eters were used. Post-acquisition image processing was 
carried out using <rs type="software">CorelDraw12</rs> software. </p>

<p>MITS1 (AGI: At1g52080) is a putative actin-binding pro-
tein of 573 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular 
mass of 66 kDa. The N-terminal region of this protein (39 
amino acids) contains a hydrophobic stretch of 20 residues 
(predicted with <rs type="software">TMHMM</rs> and <rs type="software">TMPred</rs> (Hofmann and 
Stoffel, 1993; Krogh et al., 2001) and flanking regions en-
riched with positively-charged amino acids (Fig. 1A). 
Because of the predicted secondary structure of this 
sequence, various publicly available bio-informatics tools 
suggest targeting of MITS1 to mitochondria (see Materials 
and methods). To confirm this prediction experimentally, 
full-length MITS1 was fused to the N-terminus of the 
yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; Fig. 1A), and the resulting 
construct was expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells for 
live cell confocal microscopy analyses. For simplicity, this 
construct was named MITS1. MITS1 appeared in </p>

<p>indicate MITS1 as a putative actin-binding protein, with an 
'actinin-type actin-binding domain signature 1' that is 
similar to a region involved in the actin-binding activity of 
the chloroplastic actin-binding protein, CHUP1 (Oikawa 
et al., 2003). In addition, several different types of protein 
domain prediction software revealed that MITS1 contains 
an AAA-ATPase motif (55-360; SMART, Schultz et al., 
1998; Letunic et al., 2006), and two leucine zipper patterns 
(279-300 and 324-345; <rs type="software">ScanProsite</rs>, (Hulo et al., 2008). In 
contrast with CHUP1, MITS1 is localized to mitochondria. 
Helical Wheel analysis strongly suggests that the pre-
sequence of MITS1 attains a secondary structure with 
a clustered cationic side that is a known property of 
mitochondria targeting sequences (Duby et al., 2001). The 
N-terminal part of the mitochondrial pre-sequence is be-
lieved to fold into an amphiphilic a-helix both in a phospho-
lipid environment and in vivo (Roise et al., 1988; Lemire 
et al., 1989). Consistent with these observations, the MITS1 
mutants with a less defined polar cluster on the side of the </p>

<p>protein chains. To compare, the curated DisProt database (Sickmeier 
et al., 2007) includes little over 500 chains, the PDB database 
(Berman et al., 2000) that allows finding unstructured segments in 
the solved tertiary structures (which are assumed to be equivalent to 
disordered segments) includes ∼58 000 proteins, while the overall 
number of known protein chains is &gt;9 million. The disorder 
is frequently observed in regions with low-sequence complexity 
and with low content of hydrophobic amino acids, which would 
often form a core of a folded globular protein (Dyson and 
Wright, 2005; Uversky et al., 2000). These and other sequence 
characteristics can be used to differentiate between disordered and 
ordered regions, which in turn implies that disorder is predictable 
from the sequence. The past decade observed development of a 
number of computational models for the prediction of the disordered 
regions. These methods allow for high-throughput annotations 
of protein chains which provide a viable solution to close the 
annotation gap. These predictors could be categorized into four 
groups: (i) methods based on relative propensity of amino acids 
to form disorder/ordered regions which include <rs type="software">GlobPlot</rs> (Linding 
et al., 2003), IUPred (Dosztányi et al., 2005), <rs type="software">FoldIndex</rs> (Prilusky 
et al., 2005) and Ucon (Schlessinger et al., 2007a); (ii) methods 
built utilizing machine-learning classifiers, such as <rs type="software">DISpro</rs> (Hecker 
et al., 2008), <rs type="software">DISOPRED</rs> (Jones and Ward, 2003) <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs> 
(Ward et al., 2004), PrDOS (Ishida and Kinoshita, 2007), <rs type="software">POODLE-
S</rs> (Shimizu et al., 2007a), <rs type="software">POODLE-L</rs> (Hirose et al., 2007), 
<rs type="software">POODLE-W</rs> (Shimizu et al., 2007b), Spritz (Vullo et al., 2006), 
<rs type="software">DisPSSMP</rs> (Su et al., 2006), <rs type="software">DisPSSMP2</rs> (Su et al., 2007), <rs type="software">IUP</rs> 
(Yang and Yang, 2006), <rs type="software">NORSnet</rs> (Schlessinger et al., 2007b) and 
OnD-CRFs (Wang and Sauer, 2008); (iii) methods based on a meta-
approach which combines predictions from multiple base predictors 
including recent MD (Schlessinger et al., 2009), metaPrDOS (Ishida 
and Kinoshita, 2008), GS-metaDisorder (J.Bujnicki, unpublished 
data) and MULTICOM (Cheng et al., 2005); and (iv) methods 
based on analysis of predicted 3D structural models, such as 
<rs id="software-39" type="software">DISOclust</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-39" type="creator">McGuffin</rs>, 2008). Since 2002, the sequence-based 
disorder predictors are biannually assessed and compared during 
the critical assessment of structure prediction (CASP) experiments. 
Although the prediction quality continues to rise, as shown in the 
most recent CASP8 (Noivirt-Brik et al., 2009), improved prediction 
methods are still urgently needed (Schlessinger et al., 2009). 
We propose a novel architecture, named MFDp (Multilayered 
Fusion-based Disorder predictor), that aims to improve the overall 
quality of the prediction when compared with modern methods. We 
analyze and quantify improvements provided by MFDp for a generic 
prediction of all disordered segments and also for the prediction of 
long-disordered segments. The latter is motivated by recent results 
that show that long-disordered regions are useful for target selection 
for structure determination of integral membrane protein (Punta </p>

<p>et al., 2009), they are implicated in protein-protein recognition 
(Tompa et al., 2009) and were found helpful in prediction of protein 
crystallization propensity (Slabinski et al., 2007). 
The MFDp is based on four novel ideas. First, motivated by 
the observation that combining orthogonal predictors is helpful 
(Oldfield et al., 2005; Schlessinger et al., 2009), we fuse four 
complementary disorder predictors. This is in contrast to earlier 
ensemble-based solutions that combined predictors selected in an ad 
hoc manner. When compared to the recently proposed orthogonal 
ensemble-based MD predictor (Schlessinger et al., 2009), we 
consider different aspects to judge dissimilarity. MD combines four 
predictors that tackle different 'types' of disorder, while we combine 
three methods that differ in their approach to perform predictions. 
We use a machine learning-based predictor <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs>, residue 
propensity-based <rs type="software">IUPred</rs> and a recent <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs> that is based on 
tertiary structure predictions (i.e. prediction based on the sequence-
derived tertiary structure). The usage of the 3D-based predictor is 
the novel aspect of our ensemble. We select DISOPRED2 since 
it was demonstrated to provide high-quality predictions and to be 
orthogonal to other machine learning-based methods (Schlessinger 
et al., 2009). The <rs type="software">IUPred</rs> provides two models that specialize 
in prediction of long-and short-disordered regions, respectively. 
The DISOclust utilizes a premise that ordered residues should be 
conserved in 3D space in multiple models, whereas residues that 
vary or are consistently missing are correlated with the disorder. It 
predicts per-residue error in multiple fold recognition models which 
is followed by an analysis of the conservation of the per-residue 
errors across all models (McGuffin, 2008). 
Second, we use the most comprehensive selection of the input 
information sources when compared with the recent methods 
(Table 1). Similar to MD, <rs type="software">DISpro</rs> and MULTICOM, we use the 
sequence profiles (the most widely used inputs; Table 1), predicted 
secondary structure (SS) [disordered regions are characterized by 
lack of SS (Radivojac et al., 2004, 2007; Vucetic et al., 2003)] 
and solvent accessibility [unstructured regions have a large solvent-
accessible area (Schlessinger et al., 2009)]. We also utilize sequence-
based predictions of backbone dihedral torsion angles, B-factor 
[which are associated with disordered regions (Zhang et al., 2009)] </p>

<p>and the sequence terminus indicator [similarly to PrDOS (Su et al., 
2007)]. The usage of the backbone angles is motivated by their 
usefulness in building-scoring function for fold recognition and 3D 
structure prediction (Wu and Zhang, 2008), and by the success of 
the 3D-based <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs> that ranked fourth in CASP8 (Noivirt-Brik 
et al., 2009). We tried predictions of signal peptides, but we did not 
find them useful. 
Third, we aggregate the predictions, before feeding them into a 
classifier, using a sliding window to facilitate predictions of long-
disordered regions. The aggregation utilizes neighboring predictions 
to perform averaging, to find maximal and minimal prediction 
value/probability and to analyze local SS conformations, which 
helps the classifier to find longer stretches of disordered residues. 
Fourth, we use two-layered architecture where the first layer 
includes three predictors, one designed for all disordered residues, 
one for short (&lt;30 residues), and one for long segments. These 
predictors use different inputs encoded using numerical descriptors 
derived from the abovementioned sources. The second layer 
combines their outputs to generate our disorder predictions. 
MFDp is capable of recognizing various types of disorder, since 
it is trained using a dataset that includes residues from disordered 
regions of all sizes and that combines proteins from the DisProt 
database and X-ray structures from the PDB. </p>

<p>Predictions are performed using an ensemble of three SVM classifiers that 
are designated to predict all disordered residues (SVM ALL ), and disordered 
residues in long (≥30 residues) (SVM LONG ) and short segments (&lt;30 
residues) (SVM SHORT ). Each classifier is designed individually, i.e. uses 
different parameters and different set of input features (see Sections 2.5 
and 2.6) computed from the <rs type="software">IUPred</rs>, <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs> and <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs> 
predictions, the sequence, the sequence profiles and the various relevant 
sequence-based predictions. The latter predictions are performed using 
methods chosen based on two criteria: (i) their quality is comparable 
to the leading relevant predictors; and (ii) they provide a stand-alone 
implementation that could be utilized to build an autonomous implementation 
of the proposed disorder predictor. We utilize PSIPRED (McGuffin et al., 
2000) for the SS prediction, <rs type="software">Real-SPINE3</rs> for the prediction of the relative 
solvent accessibility (RSA) and backbone dihedral torsion angles (Faraggi 
et al., 2009), <rs id="software-57" type="software">PROFbval</rs> for the B-factor prediction and residue flexibility 
prediction (<rs corresp="#software-57" type="creator">Schlessinger</rs> et al., 2006) and RPSP for the signal peptide 
prediction (Plewczynski et al., 2008). We also use <rs type="software">IUPred</rs> to predict globular 
domains. The selection of the SVM as the classifiers was motivated by its 
prior extensive use in disorder prediction (Hirose et al., 2007; Ishida and 
Kinoshita 2007, 2008; Peng et al., 2006; Shimizu et al., 2007a, b; Vullo, 
et al. 2006). We use a linear-kernel-based SVM introduced in Fan et al. 
(2008). The real-valued prediction is computed as a maximum among the 
probabilities generated by SVM ALL , SVM SHORT and SVM LONG (we combine 
all predicted disordered residues) and the resulting value is binarized using 
the threshold that equals 0.37. The value of the threshold was found using the 
MxD dataset. We 'smooth out' our binary predictions by filtering out short 
segments (≤2 residues). On the first pass, we convert predicted ordered 
residues in segments ≤2 residues to disordered residues with probability of 
0.37. One the second pass, we reassign the short, ≤2 residues, segments of 
disordered residues as ordered with probability of 0.369. The MFDp predictor 
is shown in Figure 1. </p>

<p>The MFDp utilizes four complementary disorder predictors, <rs type="software">IUPred LONG 
(IUPREDL</rs>), <rs type="software">IUPred SHORT (IUPREDS</rs>), <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs> and <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs>; 
the sequence, the PSSM profile (Altschul et al., 1997), the predicted SS, 
the predicted RSA, the predicted globular domains (IUPREDG), backbone 
dihedral torsion angles and signal peptides. The predictors were run with 
their default parameters. The PSSM profiles were generated using the non-
redundant (nr) database from NCBI (downloaded on November 19, 2009), 
which was filtered using PFILT (Jones and Swindells, 2002) to remove 
low-complexity regions, transmembrane regions and coiled-coil segments. 
We utilize a sliding window of size 15 centered over the predicted residue 
to extract the features. We use the raw numerical values for each of the 
15 positions, which include: the probability of the prediction of disordered 
residues from IUPREDL, IUPREDS, DISOPRED2 and DISOclust; the 
PSSM values; the probabilities of prediction of helix, coil and strand 
conformations from PSIPRED; the predicted B-factor values; the predicted 
solvent accessibility and backbone angles; and the binary values denoting 
whether a given position in the window is predicted as a signal peptide, </p>

<p>belongs to a globular domain, is part of a purification tag or is predicted 
as flexible by <rs type="software">PROFbval</rs>, to encode the features. We also aggregate the raw 
numerical values (except for the predicted backbone angles) by computing 
averages in the sliding widows of sizes between 3 and 41, and by taking 
maximal and minimal value in the sliding widows of sizes between 3 and 
15. The averages for the residue at the i-th position in the sequence are 
computed as follows: </p>

<p>where X ∈{PSSM_{AA j }, SS_{SS k }, RSA, IUPREDL, IUPREDS, 
DISOPRED, DISOCLUST} is the name of a given feature, AA j with 
j ∈{1,2,...,20} is the amino acid type, SS k with k ∈{H, E, C} is the type 
of the SS, avg m with m ∈{3,5,7,...39,41} is the size of the window, w n with 
n ∈{−20,−19,...,19,20} is the position in the window where 0 denotes the 
position of the predicted residue, and X_w{w n } is the value of feature X for 
the residue at position w n (the actual position in the sequence equals i+w n ). 
When aggregating, we ignore the positions in the window that are outside 
of the chain for the residues close to the sequence terminus, i.e. we sum 
only the values for the positions in the chain and this sum is dived by the 
total number of these positions. The features are divided into 17 categories 
based on the source information used including sequence, PSSM, amino-acid 
frequency, conservation, SS, RSA, torsion angles, <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs>, <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs>, 
<rs type="software">IUPREDL</rs>, IUPREDS, B-factor, signal peptides, purification tag, globular 
domains, strict flexibility and non-strict flexibility. Detailed description is 
provided in the appendix at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MFDp.html. </p>

<p>We compare MFDp with relevant predictors on the MxD and CASP8 
datasets. For the MxD dataset, we use 5-fold cross validation to 
assess our predictions; we use 75% of each of the five training 
subsets to compute SVMs, the other 25% to find the threshold used 
for binarization of the probabilities, and the test subsets to evaluate 
predictions. In contrast, predictions from other method are generated 
on the entire dataset (without cross-validation) using either web-
servers or stand-alone implementations provided by the authors. 
For the test on the CASP8 dataset, the MFDp is trained, including 
computation of SVMs (using the same parameters as for the MxD 
dataset) and the selection of the threshold, using all fully disordered 
and PDB chains in the MxD dataset; these chains have similar 
disorder characteristics to the chains in the CASP8. The training 
chains from the MxD dataset share at most 25% identity to any 
chain the CASP8 set making it challenging to perform predictions. 
On the contrary, the methods we compare with use large training 
datasets that may share substantial similarity to the CASP8 targets 
(i.e only a handful of CASP8 target were consider as free-modeling), 
which could raise their predictive quality. 
The cross-validated predictions of MFDp are compared to its 
input predictors, including: <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs>; <rs type="software">IUPredL</rs> and <rs type="software">IUPredS</rs> 
(IUPred predictions for short and long segments); <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs>; and 
<rs type="software">PROFBval</rs>, and with selected other recent methods including the </p>

<p>consensus-based MD (Schlessinger et al., 2009), the propensity-
based <rs id="software-72" type="software">Ucon</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-72" type="creator">Schlessinger</rs> et al., 2007a) and the machine learning-
based <rs id="software-73" type="software">NORSnet</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-73" type="creator">Schlessinger</rs> et al., 2007b). Our results on the 
CASP8 dataset are also compared against five top-performing 
methods in the CASP8 experiments (Noivirt-Brik et al., 2009). 
These methods are identified by the group number in square 
brackets (as registered for the CASP8 meeting) and the group 
name. They include GS-MetaServer2 [153], <rs type="software">GeneSilicoMetaServer</rs> 
[297], MULTICOM-CMFR [69] (Cheng et al., 2005), <rs id="software-75" type="software">DISOclust</rs> 
[97] (<rs corresp="#software-75" type="creator">McGuffin</rs>, 2008) and McGuffin [379], which is a human-
based consensus that uses DISOclust. More detailed description 
of these predictors can be found in the CASP8 abstracts at 
http://predictioncenter.org/casp8/doc/CASP8_book.pdf. 
We compare predictive quality when considering all disordered 
regions and for the regions that are at least 30 residues long, 
respectively. The selection of the length threshold is consistent with 
values used in the recent investigation of protein-protein recognition 
mechanisms (Tompa et al. 2009) and in design of predictors for 
long segments (Han et al. 2009; Peng et al. 2006). The same as in 
the CASP8, we discard the disordered regions with three or fewer 
residues (Noivirt-Brik et al., 2009; private correspondence with 
authors), i.e. these residues are ignored when computing the quality 
measures. Similarly, for the results on the long segments we discard 
the shorter regions. Following the CASP8, predictions were assessed </p>

<p>using bootstrapping in which 80% of the targets were randomly 
selected 1000 times and we report the corresponding averages and 
standard deviations see Tables 2 and 3. We recomputed the results 
for the CASP8 submissions and we found them consistent with the 
original report (Noivirt-Brik et al., 2009). We also analyze statistical 
significance of the differences between MFDp and the other 
methods. We compared the 1000 paired average results for MCC, 
S w and AUC obtained from using the bootstrapping with 80% of the 
targets on both CASP8 and MxD datasets. Since the averages do not 
follow normal distribution, as tested using Shapiro-Wilk test at the 
0.05 significance, we use Wilcoxon rank sum test and we measure 
significance of the differences at 0.01 level. Tables 2 and 3 show 
that MFDp consistently outperforms all methods based on the MCC 
index. These improvements are statistically significant with P &lt; 0.01 
when compared with all considered competitors on both datasets and 
for both all and long-disordered segments, except for <rs type="software">NORSnet</rs> and 
<rs type="software">IUPREDL</rs> on the long regions and the CASP8 dataset. Results on the 
MxD dataset demonstrate that MFDp significantly outperforms its 
input methods as well as MD, <rs type="software">NORSnet</rs> and <rs type="software">Ucon</rs> when considering 
the S w and AUC values and for both all and long-disordered 
segments. Only MD method is shown to be comparable with 
respect to the AUC values. For the prediction of both all and long 
segments on the smaller CASP8 dataset, the MFDp significantly 
improves over its input predictors, MD, <rs type="software">NORSnet</rs> and Ucon for </p>

<p>the binary prediction measured using MCC and S w . The fact that 
MFDp is successful in maintaining high-quality predictions for the 
long segments is important given that predictors designed for long 
disordered regions are usually less successful in predicting short 
regions (Obradovic et al., 2005; Peng et al., 2005). Our method 
is outperformed on the S w and AUC values for the prediction of 
all segments by the top five CASP8 methods, but we significantly 
improve over these methods based on the MCC index. We also 
significantly improve over their binary assignments, measured with 
MCC and S w , for the long-disordered segments. Our improvement 
are achieved in spite of the fact that our training chains share 
&lt;25% identity to CASP8 targets, while the top predictors in CASP8 
use training sequences that likely share more significant similarity. 
Moreover, the GS-MetaServer2 [153] and <rs type="software">GeneSilicoMetaServer</rs> 
[297] are unpublished and do not offer implementations/servers. 
The McGuffin [379] method is not automated and requires human 
expert and the <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs> [97] results submitted to CASP8 are better 
than the results generated by the stand-alone <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs> provided to 
us by the authors. The MFDp is available as an automated web 
server at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MFDp.html. The ROCs for 
the predictions on both datasets are shown in Figure 2. This figure 
focuses on the FP rates &lt; 0.5; the entire curve is given in the 
appendix at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MFDp.html. The curve 
reveals that MFDp provides favorable TP rates for the FP values </p>

<p>We investigate the quality of our predictions applied to find proteins 
with long (≥30 residues)-disordered regions. This binary prediction 
is motivated by the fact that this information is useful for target 
selection (Punta et al., 2009; Slabinski et al., 2007) and protein-
protein recognition (Tompa et al., 2009). Similar evaluation was also 
performed for the MD (Schlessinger et al., 2009). Although ∼43% 
of disordered residues in CASP8 are in the long segments (allowing 
for a relatively robust per-residues evaluations), there are only 15 
such segments and thus we did not use this dataset. The results 
on the MD dataset obtained using 5-fold cross validation for the 
MFDp and the predictions from the servers for MD, <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs>, 
<rs type="software">IUPred</rs>, <rs type="software">NORSnet</rs>, <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs>, <rs type="software">Ucon</rs> and <rs type="software">PROFbval</rs> are summarized </p>

<p>We selected CASP8 target T0480 (PDBid 2K4X) which was solved 
with NMR, and CASP8 target T0404 (PDBid 2DFE) which was 
solved with X-ray crystallography, as our case studies. We compare 
side-by-side prediction of MFDp, its input predictors <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs>, 
<rs type="software">IUPred</rs>, <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs>, the recent ensemble-based MD, and two top-
performing on the CASP8 (with respect to MCC) McGuffin 
[379] and <rs type="software">GeneSilicoMetaServer</rs> [297] methods (Fig. 4). For the 
T0480, which is a small protein with ∼50% disordered residues 
located at sequence termini, MFDp finds both disordered segments, 
achieves below-average MCC of 0.59 and improves over predictions 
of its ensemble predictors. The MD over-predicts disorder and 
<rs type="software">GeneSilicoMetaServer</rs> generates predictions comparable to that of 
MFDp. The T0404 includes 25% disordered residues with one longer 
segment away from the termini. Most of the predictors find both 
disordered segments, and they also incorrectly annotate another 
disordered segment at the N-terminus, except IUPREDL which 
predicts only the middle segment. The <rs type="software">GeneSilicoMetaServer</rs> and 
MD slightly over-predict disorder, and the segment in the center 
of the chain is most accurately predicted by MFDp, <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs> 
and McGuffin. Although these predictions should not be assumed 
typical, they demonstrate that the MFDp can outperform all of its 
input predictors. </p>

<p>Background While electroacupuncture (EA) 
pretreatment has been found to ameliorate 
migraine-like symptoms, the underlying 
mechanisms remain poorly understood. 
Emerging evidence suggests that the brainstem 
descending pain modulatory system, comprising 
the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus 
nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis 
(TNC), may be involved in migraine 
pathophysiology. We hypothesised that EA 
would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms via 
modulation of this descending system. 
Methods We used a conscious rat model of 
migraine induced by repeated electrical 
stimulation of the dura. Forty male Sprague-
Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of 
four groups: an EA group, which received EA at 
GB20 following dural stimulation; a sham 
acupuncture (SA) group, which received manual 
acupuncture at a non-acupuncture point 
following dural stimulation; a Model group, 
which received dural stimulation but no 
acupuncture; and a Control group, which 
received neither dural stimulation nor 
acupuncture (electrode implantation only). 
<rs type="software">HomeCageScan</rs> was used to measure effects on 
behaviour, and immunofluorescence staining was 
used to examine neural activation (c-Fos 
immunoreactivity) in the PAG, RMg, and TNC. 
Results Compared to the Model group, rats in 
the EA group showed a significant increase in 
exploratory, locomotor and eating/drinking 
behaviour ( p&lt;0.01) and a significant decrease in 
freezing-like resting and grooming behaviour 
( p&lt;0.05). There was a significant increase in the 
mean number of c-Fos neurons in the PAG, 
RMg, and TNC in Model versus Control groups 
( p&lt;0.001); however, this was significantly 
attenuated by EA treatment ( p&lt;0.001). There 
were no significant differences between the SA </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms underlying the 
analgesic effect of acupuncture (including pretreat-
ment) on migraine have not yet been determined. 
We hypothesised that acupuncture pretreatment 
would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms in recurrent 
migraine via modulation of the brainstem descending 
pain modulatory system: the periaqueductal grey 
(PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal 
nucleus caudalis (TNC). To test this hypothesis we 
chose a rat model of recurrent migraine induced by 
repeated electrical stimulation of the dura surrounding 
the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), which is an estab-
lished paradigm of migraine-associated pain. 
11 12 The 
aim of the present study was to examine the effect of 
EA on behaviour (using <rs type="software">HomeCageScan</rs> technology) 
and neuronal activation in the PAG, RMg, and TNC 
(by immunofluorescence staining). </p>

<p>Behavioural analysis by <rs type="software">HomeCageScan</rs> </p>

<p>Spontaneous behaviour was monitored by the auto-
mated behavioural acquisition and analysis software 
'<rs id="software-4" type="software">HomeCageScan</rs>' (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Clever Systems Inc.</rs>, Reston, 
Virginia, USA). Before real/sham electrical dural 
stimulation, rats were acclimatised for 20 min in an 
individual transparent acrylic observation cage with an 
automatic real-time video surveillance and image ana-
lysis system, which was lit to model daytime condi-
tions. Subsequently, animals received electrical dural 
stimulation for 15 min in another cage before being 
individually placed back into the observation cage for 
a 1 h recording. 
The observation cage was cleaned with 10% 
ethanol between sessions to eliminate odour traces. 
Behaviours were analysed by identifying body parts </p>

<p>After the last <rs type="software">HomeCageScan</rs> recording session, 
animals were anaesthetised with 10% chloral hydrate 
(15 ml/kg, intraperitoneally) and transcardially per-
fused through the ascending aorta with 100 ml 0.1 M 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 500 mL 
of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were 
removed and postfixed overnight at 4°C in 4% PFA/ 
PBS, then transferred to 30% sucrose/PBS for 72 h 
for cryopreservation. Coronal sections (25 mm thick) 
through the PAG, RMg, and TNC were cut using a 
cryostat (Leica CM3050S, Leica Inc, Wetzlar, 
Germany), incubated with rabbit anti-c-Fos antiserum 
(sc-52, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, USA) 
overnight at 4°C, and then treated with Cy3 goat anti-
rabbit secondary antibodies (111-165-003, 1:500, 
Jackson 
ImmunoResearch 
Laboratories 
Inc, 
Pennsylvania, USA) for 2 h at room temperature 
before being mounted, dehydrated, and cover-slipped 
in anti-fade reagent (AR1109, Boster Bioengineering 
Inc, Wuhan, China). 
Section images were captured using a Leica semi-
automatic light microscope (Leica DM5500 B), and 
cells were counted in squares at 20× magnification. </p>

<p>Figure 1 Schematic representation of the experimental protocol. One week after surgery to implant electrodes, rats received 
electrical dural stimulation (or no stimulation in the case of the Control group) every 2 days from day 1 to day 5 (on days 1, 3, and 5). 
Electroacupuncture (or sham acupuncture) pretreatment was performed daily from day 0 to day 5 (on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) in 
subgroups of rats. Behavioural analysis was carried out using <rs type="software">HomeCageScan</rs> immediately after dural stimulation on days 1, 3, and 
5. c-Fos immunofluorescence was measured in brain tissues prepared following necropsy on day 5. </p>

<p>Data are presented as mean±SD. Groups were com-
pared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using 
the <rs id="software-6" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</rs> Software 
(SPSS) <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">V.12.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>, Chicago, Illinois, USA). 
Post-hoc testing was performed using Bonferroni 
(homogeneity of variance) or Tamhane (heterogeneity 
of variance) tests. Statistical significance was defined 
as p&lt;0.05. </p>

<p>The rat model of migraine used herein was developed 
to mimic clinical pain conditions experienced by 
migraineurs, based upon clinical diagnostic criteria 
from the International Classification of Headache 
Disorders (ICHD)-II and ICHD-IIIβ classification 
including a decrease in physical activity during 
migraine attacks. 
3 20 Analysis of behavioural changes 
using <rs type="software">HomeCageScan</rs> offers a new way to study 
migraine. 
18 However, it should be remembered that 
there are clear differences in pathophysiology between 
this model and the human condition, which may limit 
the ability to extrapolate our results. 
Similar to previous studies, 
17 18 we found that 
repeated stimulation of the dura produced an increase 
in nociceptive behaviour, such as freezing and resting. 
There was also a decrease in exploratory, locomotor 
and eating/drinking behaviour. Collectively, these 
reflect the clinical symptoms of migraine attacks, 
which includes a reduction in routine physical activity, 
loss of motivation, and decreased intake of food and 
drink. 
3 4 21 Interestingly, these behavioural changes 
were reversed by EA pretreatment, as the EA group 
exhibited decreased nociceptive behaviour and 
increased exploratory, locomotor and eating/drinking 
behaviour. 
It has been suggested that grooming in rats may 
reflect the cutaneous allodynia that migraineurs often 
suffer during an episode. 
18 Cutaneous allodynia arises 
as a consequence of central sensitisation of the TNC 
and higher structures, such as the thalamus, PAG, and 
RMg. 
5 22 It is an independent predictor of migraine 
progression and is closely related with imbalances in 
the brainstem descending pain modulatory system. </p>

<p>Sequence analysis and structure prediction 
Sequencing of the recombinant plasmids and the PCR amplifica-
tion products was performed according to Lata et al. (2010). 
Alignments were carried out by <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs> with default parameters 
(Thompson et al., 1994). The phylogenetic tree for the SiDREB2 
gene was built using the software program <rs id="software-1" type="software">MEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">4.0</rs> based on 
protein sequences. The phylogenetic tree was set up with the 
distance matrix using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method with 
1000 bootstrap replications. Secondary structure prediction of the 
SiDREB2 protein was performed using the program <rs type="software">PSIPRED</rs> 
(Jones, 1999). The ab intio structure prediction of the protein was 
done with the help of <rs type="software">I-TASSER</rs> (Zhang, 2008). Automated 
homology model building of the DNA-binding domain was 
performed using the protein structure modelling program <rs type="software">MOD-
ELLER</rs> which models protein tertiary structure by satisfaction of 
spatial restraints. The input for <rs type="software">MODELLER</rs> consisted of the 
aligned sequences of 1gcc and the SiDREB2, a steering file that 
gives all the necessary commands to the MODELLER to produce 
a homology model of the target on the basis of its alignment with 
the template. Energy minimization was performed by the steepest 
descent followed by the conjugate gradient method using a 20 Å 
non-bonded cut-off and a constant dielectric of 1.0. Evaluation of 
the predicted model involved analyses of the geometry and the 
stereochemistry of the model. The reliability of the model structure 
was tested using the ENERGY commands of <rs type="software">MODELLER</rs> (Sali 
and Blundell, 1993). The modelled structures were also validated 
using the program <rs type="software">PROSA</rs> (Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007). </p>

<p>and Actin RT_R, 5#-GCCTTGACCATACCAGTTCCA-3#). The 
amount of transcript accumulated for the SiDREB2 gene 
(SiDREB2 RT_F, 5#-GCCTTGTAGTCATTTGTGGTTT-3#; 
and SiDREB2 RT_R, 5#-CCTCACAACTCCTTTTCTCAAGCT-
3#) normalized to the internal control actin was analysed using 
the 2-
DD Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The primers 
used for real-time PCR analysis were designed by using <rs id="software-9" type="software">Primer 
Express</rs> <rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">version 3.0</rs>. The PCR cycling conditions were: initial 
denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min 
for 40 cycles, 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min and 95°C for 
15 s. </p>

<p>SNP assay 
A core set of 45 foxtail millet accessions, listed in Table 1, were 
analysed for SNP discovery by re-sequencing of the SiDREB2 
gene. Genomic DNA was extracted as mentioned earlier. The 
SiDREB2 FL_F/SiDREB2 FL_R primer pair was used to amplify 
full-length SiDREB2 in all 45 accessions. PCR was performed 
using Sigma Taq DNA polymerase (1 U) in a 20 ll reaction 
volume containing ;50 ng of gemonic DNA, 13 PCR buffer 
(1.5 mM MgCl 2 ), 10 lM of each dNTP, and 10 pmol of each 
primer. PCR cycling was done as mentioned earlier. Amplified 
PCR products were precipitated and sequenced in both directions. 
Sequences were aligned by <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs>. </p>

The nuclear localization signal (RRK) in the N-terminus is underlined in bold. The serine/threonine-rich region has dashed underlining. 
Two conserved amino acid residues, valine (V) and glutamic acid (E), in the AP2 domain of the SiDREB2 protein are double underlined. 
The AP2/ERF conserved domain of SiDREB2 is single underlined. The start (ATG) and stop (TAG) codons are boxed. Full-length

SiDREB2 protein with other DREB proteins using <rs id="software-12" type="software">CLC</rs> free workbench <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">version 3.0</rs>. The amino acid residues with 100% homology are 
light in colour while the partially conserved residues are in different colours. The consensus sequence is shown in bold in black at the 
bottom of the alignment. (C) Phylogenetic analysis of AP2/ERF domains of published AP2/EREBP proteins in the NCBI database. The 
phylogenetic tree was generated by <rs id="software-13" type="software">MEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-13" type="version-number">4.0</rs> software. Branch lengths indicate the distance. A-1 to A-6 indicate the groups proposed 
by Sakuma et al. (2002). SiDREB2 is indicated by a circle. The appended proteins are as follows: Arabidopsis thaliana DREB1 
(BAA33434), DREB1B (BAA33435), DREB1C (BAA33436), RAP2.1 (NP564496), RAP2.10 (NP195408), RAP2.3 (NP188299), RAP2.4 
(NP177931), RAP2.6 (AAC36019), CBF1 (NP567721), DREB2A (AAU93685), DREB2B (BAA36706), DREB2C (Q8LFR2), ABI4 
(AF085279), RAV1 (NP172784), RAV2 (AB013887), ERF1 (AB008103), ERF3 (AB008105), TINY (AAC29139); Oryza sativa OsDREB1A </p>

<p>sequence similarity in the AP2/ERF domain indicated that 
DREB genes were well conserved among gramineous crops 
(Fig. 1B). To determine further the relatedness of SiDREB2 
to the other AP2/EREBP proteins, a systematic phyloge-
netic analysis was carried out based on the similarities of 
AP2 domains in the proteins isolated from Arabidopsis, 
rice, maize, wheat, sorghum, barley, Festuca, Phyllostachys, 
tomato, tobacco, cotton, Catharanthus, and Brassica species 
using <rs id="software-14" type="software">MEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-14" type="version-number">4.0</rs> by the NJ method (Fig. 1C). SiDREB2 
was classified into the A-2 subgroup of the DREB sub-
family on the basis of the phylogenetic tree constructed. </p>

<p>molecular function. To create a 3D structure of SiDREB2, 
a BLAST search was performed in protein databases for 
proteins with similar sequence and known 3D structure, but 
no significant homologous template was found to model the 
complete sequence. Thus, ab initio modelling of SiDREB2 
was done with the help of the <rs type="software">I-TASSER</rs> server. In brief, 
this is a hierarchical protein structure modelling approach 
based on the secondary structure-enhanced Profile-Profile 
threading alignment (Zhang, 2008). The model structure 
was validated with <rs type="software">PROSA</rs> (z-score of -5.58) which was in 
the range of native conformations of other experimentally 
determined protein structures of the same size (Wiederstein 
and Sippl, 2007). The overall structure has an a-b fold and 
the DNA-binding domain contained antiparallel b-sheets 
and an a-helix packed approximately parallel to the b-sheet 
(Fig. 1D). This domain, which is highly positively charged, </p>

<p>binds the negatively charged DNA double helix. The 
tertiary structure is stabilized by 224 intramolecular hydro-
gen bonds as determined by the program <rs type="software">HBPLUS</rs> 
(McDonald and Thornton, 1994). The majority of these 
hydrogen bonds (44%) are formed by atoms where both the 
acceptor and donor are from the main chain of the amino 
acid residues. Only in 25% of the cases are both the 
acceptor and donor atoms the side chain atoms. The rest 
(31%) are observed where both main chain and side chain 
atoms are participating. </p>

<p>The structure of the AP2 domain of AtERF1 from 
Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB code 1gcc) was taken as a tem-
plate for the comparative modelling of the DNA-binding 
domain of SiDREB2 (Fig. 1E) (Allen et al., 1998). The 
sequence alignment between the target and the template is 
shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online. In addition, 
the secondary structure of this domain as predicted by 
several secondary structure prediction servers (<rs id="software-18" type="software">PHDsec</rs>: 
<rs corresp="#software-18" type="url">www.predictprotein.org</rs>/; <rs id="software-19" type="software">PSIPRED</rs>: <rs corresp="#software-19" type="url">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred</rs>/) is quite similar to the secondary structure of 
1gcc (Supplementary Fig. S1, and Fig. 1E). This finding 
supports the results obtained from several fold recognition 
servers 
(<rs id="software-20" type="software">FUGUE</rs>: 
<rs corresp="#software-20" type="url">www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/;fugue</rs>/; 
<rs id="software-21" type="software">3DPSSM</rs>: <rs corresp="#software-21" type="url">www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk</rs>/), suggesting that SiDREB2 
has the fold of the DNA-binding domain of the DREB 
superfamily. Based on the above information, the 'A' 
subunit of 1gcc was used as a template to predict the 3D 
structure of SiDREB2 by applying the comparative model-
ling strategy as described in the Materials and methods. The 
overall rmsd (root mean square deviation) between the 
template and the target structure is 0.2 Å . The calculated 
angle between the b-sheet and a-helices is ;172°. The 
amino acid residues Arg6, Arg8, Trp10, Glu16, Arg18, 
Arg25, and Trp27 that are known to make direct 
contact with the DNA double helix for deciphering the 
DNA-binding activity are also fully conserved. </p>

<p>A core set of 45 foxtail millet accessions were screened for 
their dehydration tolerance on the basis of LP and RWC 
(Table 1). All the accessions were subjected to 24 h of 
dehydration stress as compared with the respective controls. 
The amplified genomic DNA sequence (SiDREB2 FL_F 
and SiDREB2 FL_R primers) analysis of SiDREB2 from 
four highly dehydration-tolerant (GS-464, IC-403579, Pra-
sad, and IC-403476) and four highly sensitive (IC-403521, 
IC-404178, Lepakshi, and IC-480117) accessions revealed 
the synonymous SNP at base pair 558 (A/G transition) 
(Fig. 5A). This A/G transition was further validated by 
sequencing of the SiDREB2 gene with the same primers in 
an additional 11 and 26 dehydration-tolerant and sensitive 
accessions, respectively (Table 1). Based on this sequence 
analysis, locus-specific primers (LSPs) and allele-specific 
primers (ASPs) were developed (Table 2). PCR products 
of LSPs (SiDREB2 FL_F and SNP.TS_R) and ASPs 
(DREB.AP2_F and SNP.Tol_R) in all 45 accessions were 
generated at the same time and checked by resolving them 
on a 1% agarose gel independently. Later, the PCR 
products were mixed and resolved on an agarose gel for 
both locus-specific markers and ASMs (Fig. 5B). LSPs gave 
a 558 bp fragment in all the accessions, while ASPs gave 
a 261 bp fragment in 15 dehydration-tolerant accessions 
only. Therefore, the dehydration-tolerant accessions were 
proven to be linked to the 'A'-specific allele (Table1). 
The importance of allele-specific PCR systems for reliable 
SNP typing has been demonstrated several times in previous 
studies (Wu et al., 1989; Wei et al., 2006). Introduction of 
additional mismatch bases has improved the specificity of 
this technique (Drenkard et al., 2000). Its application is 
especially important for an accurate discrimination of 
different alleles in <rs type="software">MAS</rs>. In the present study, only one pair 
of ASPs was used to amplify the specific products from the 
dehydration-tolerant and sensitive accessions. Therefore, </p>

<p>the ASM can be effectively used to type SNPs as well as to 
avoid unambiguous false scoring. The functional differences 
in trait performance mainly caused by SNPs has also been 
reported in previous studies on several cloned genes (Peng 
et al., 1999; Takahashi et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2002; Jin 
et al., 2003; Toshiyuki et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2005; Garcés-
Claver et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2009). Molecular marker-
assisted breeding technology is a rapid and accurate method 
for any candidate gene, providing a very effective tool for 
backcross breeding (Collard and Mackill, 2008). <rs type="software">MAS</rs> 
efficiency is influenced by several complex factors such as 
recombination between the marker and the candidate gene, 
a low level of polymorphism between the parents with 
contrasting traits, and lower resolution of quantitative trait 
loci (QTLs) due to environmental interactions. In the 
present study, the ASM is part of the candidate gene, thus 
eliminating the main disadvantage of <rs type="software">MAS</rs>. However, the 
ASM developed in this study is a dominant marker, and 
therefore it cannot distinguish the heterozygotes. The 
marker has high reliability and efficiency, and the desired 
PCR product can be identified easily on a simple agarose 
gel. With the help of this marker, dehydration-tolerant 
accessions can be selected at a variety of life stages. This is 
particularly true when the target is the dehydration-tolerant 
allele in backcross breeding and thus the foxtail millet 
breeding process can be accelerated. Further, the ASM 
identified would facilitate allele mining of foxtail millet 
germplasm resources, thereby leading to identification and 
utilization of newer alleles in crop improvement. </p>

sequence of SiDREB2 containing the SNP in four dehydration-sensitive (IC-404178, Lepakshi, IC-403521, and IC-480117) and four 
tolerant (IC-403579, IC-403476, GS-464, and Prasad) foxtail millet accessions. Asterisks denote similar sequences, the box represents 
the SNP, solid arrows represent allele-specific primers (DREB.AP2_F and SNP.Tol_R), and the dashed arrow represents the locus-
specific reverse primer (SNP.TS_R). The locus-specific forward primer is shown as a dashed arrow in Fig. 1A. (B) Agarose gel image of 
the allele-specific and locus-specific SNP-derived allele-specific marker (ASM) associated with dehydration tolerance. The ASM can 
distinguish the A allele (tolerant), which generates a 261 bp fragment, from the G allele (sensitive), which generates no PCR fragment. 
The 558 bp fragment is common to both alleles and it is used as a positive control. The order of samples is the same as in Table 1. </p>

<p>We used survey data analysis methods in the STATA 
Corp. 2011, <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA Statistical Software</rs> (Release 12. College 
Station, TX: <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">STATA Corp LP. Package</rs>). Moreover, descrip-
tive analysis was used to determine the percentage of ab-
dominal obesity, overweight and general obesity among 
children and adolescents. </p>

<p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. 
Frequencies and proportions were calculated for dichoto-
mous variables, and continuous variables are presented as 
mean values with standard deviations. 
Simple logistic regression analyses were conducted to 
investigate the association between impaired renal function 
and factors extracted from the medical record: age, sex, 
living situation and MMSE score. A multiple logistic 
regression analysis was conducted including all variables 
from the simple models except MMSE score because of the 
large proportion of missing values and the absence of any 
differences found on univariate analysis. 
Further, simple logistic regression analyses were con-
ducted to investigate the association between inappropriate 
prescription and factors extracted from the medical record 
(age, sex, living situation and MMSE score). A multiple 
logistic regression analysis was conducted including all 
variables from the simple models except MMSE score 
because of a large proportion of missing values and the 
absence of any differences found on univariate analysis.

<p>factorial design using <rs type="software">Design Expert Software</rs>. 
In this method of optimization, it is difficult to develop an 
optimized formulation as the method reveals nothing about 
the interaction among the variables. The independent variable 
selected were, concentration of drug (A), concentration of PLGA/ 
PEG-PLGA (B), PVA concentration in aqueous phase (C) and 
sonication time (D). Hence, a 3 
4 factorial design was used with 
4 factors (A, B, C and D) at 3 levels and experimental trials were 
performed at all 82 possible combinations which reveals that on </p>

<p>of PEGylation of nanoparticles. The PDE (dependent variable) 
obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and 
D). The response surface quadratic models were generated using 
<rs type="software">Expert Design Software</rs>. These were subjected to multiple regres-
sion to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). 
The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated 
which are found to be &gt; 0.94 indicating good fit. The PDE values 
measured for various batches showed wide variation i.e., ranges 
from a minimum of 52.89% to a maximum of 77.96% in case 
of temozolomide bearing Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while a 
minimum of 49.62% to a maximum of 75.91% in case temozolo-
mide bearing PEGylated nanoparticles. It is clearly indicated that 
the PDE is strongly affected by the variables selected for the study. 
It is observed that as on increasing the concentration of PLGA 
polymer in the matrix of nanoparticles the percent drug entrap-
ment was found to increased up to the level of medium (i.e., 50 
mg) at 5 mg of drug concentration then very little change in PDE 
was observed which could be due to completely entrapment of the 
drug into the polymer matrix. </p>

<p>lip. The camera lens was adjusted to be parallel to the apparent occlusal 
plane and the camera focused only on the portion between the nose 
and chin. The subject was instructed to sit and hold the head naturally 
after leveling with the Frankfort horizontal plane during the study 
period (Figure 1). In addition, one millimeter scale was placed adja-
cent to the subject's right tragus and used as an external reference. A 
laptop (INSPIRON 1545, Dell, Austin, TX, USA) was placed at the 
subject's eye level behind the camera. In order to prompt spontaneous 
smiling, the subjects were provided three 1-min-long comedic films to 
watch during video recording. Three complete processes of sponta-
neous smile including rest position to full smile were recorded with 
minimal intrusion of the subject while subjects were watching the 
films. 
The video clip was downloaded to a computer and processed with a 
video-editing software (Sony Vegas Pro <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">10.0</rs>; Sony Creative Software 
Inc., Middleton, WI, USA). Each frame was reviewed and analyzed. 
Two frames including the subject's lip at rest position and a maximum 
commissure-to-commissure dynamic smile were captured. These 
frames were converted into a JPEG file and renamed in <rs id="software-2" type="software">Windows 
XP Professional</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Microsoft</rs>, Redmond, WA, USA) with the subjects' 
numbers. Each file was opened in Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe 
Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and the image size of each file was 
adjusted by using the millimeter ruler as a reference. 
In order to categorize smile patterns of subjects, Rubin classifica-
tion 
1 was adapted and shown in Figure 2. In the commissure smile, the 
corners of the mouth turn upward due to the pull of the zygomaticus 
major. In the cuspid smile, the upper lip is elevated uniformly without 
the corners of the mouth turning upward; the entire lip rises like a 
window shade. In the complex or gummy smile, the upper lip moves 
superiorly, as in the cuspid smile. But the lower lip usually moves 
inferiorly in a smile fashion. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
A <rs id="software-0" type="software">Can-pro</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">4.0</rs> (computer-aided nutritional analysis program, 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Korean Nutritional Society</rs>, 2011; Seoul, Korea) was used to 
calculate nutrient intakes from the 8-day food records and FFQ, 
and the reproducibility and validity were analyzed using the 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">Statistical Analysis System</rs> program (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 9.2</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, 
Cary, NC, USA). 
The reproducibility and validity of the FFQ were determined 
by calculating the Spearman rank-order and Pearson correla-
tion coefficients. Since the food records used as comparative 
data in the FFQ validity analysis might have attenuated the 
validity due to day-to-day variations, the de-attenuated correla-
tion coefficients were calculated. The data were divided into 
four categories according to the nutrient intake. Cross-
classification was then conducted to identify the consistency 
between the first and second FFQ data, as well as between 
FFQ and food record data. The corresponding weighted kappa 
values were calculated. In addition, the Bland-Altman plots 
were generated to examine the reproducibility and validity of 
the FFQ. The cutoff for statistical significance was 0.05 in 
two-tailed testing. </p>

<p>(Harland and Birkin, chapter 5), find their place in this part of the book, but so do more general 
overviews about circular statistics (Rohde and Corcoran, chapter 7) or storage, management, and 
analysis of large space-time datasets (Miller, chapter 6). In part 3, "Making geographical decisions," 
the editors have compiled a set of geocomputational techniques used in real-world applications 
to solve specific problems. This comprises geodemographics (Alexiou and Singleton, chapter 8), 
self-organizing maps (Spielman and Folch, chapter 9), kernel densities (Lewis, chapter 10), and 
location-allocation models (Tomintz, Clarke, Alfadhi, chapter 11). These are usually illustrated with 
a practical application, rather than merely described in abstract terms, which makes the reading 
much more intuitive and serves as a good starter for the nonexperienced reader interested in 
discovering the "big picture" of the techniques. 
The fourth block of the volume, "Explaining how the world works," delves into confirmatory ap-
proaches that seek to provide insight into underlying social or natural processes. Two good examples 
are chapter 12 on Geographically Weighted GLMs (Nakaya) and chapter 13 on spatial interaction 
models (Morrisey). The final section, "Enabling interactions," covers several examples of new av-
enues for geocomputation that would have not normally been part of a more traditional book. Topics 
such as the use of crowd-sourced datasets (Brunsdon and Comber, chapter 16) or public participation 
through GIS (Kingston, chapter 18) can be found here. 
In addition to these thematic blocks, a most welcome feature of the book is the series of 
chapters intelligently inserted in each block that cover aspects of geocomputation referring to tools 
and software. In particular, it is refreshing to see how all of these relate to open-source projects freely 
available to use. The landscape where the only choices to perform geocomputational analyses were 
proprietary, desktop, point-and-click, GIS programs, or custom routines in low-level languages such 
as C or <rs type="software">FORTRAN</rs> is no longer the norm. Instead, an entire ecosystem of open-source software, more 
flexible than traditional desktop GIS and more accessible than low-level computer programming 
has emerged. Just a few years ago, it was not very clear that one day it would be possible to carry 
out serious research in geocomputation using only free and/or open-source software. That the field 
has evolved in this direction to a point where there is a full stock of tools (Rey, 2009) that realize 
such a vision is greatly inspiring and it is something that the larger community of researchers who 
have made it possible should feel proud of. The book contains an overview of open-source software 
for GIS (O'Brien, chapter 17), and two other chapters are devoted to the most common programming 
languages used in geocomputation, R (Cheshire and Lovelace, chapter 1) and <rs type="software">Python</rs> (Rey, chapter 
14). An additional chapter (15) by Brunsdon and Singleton elaborates on the idea of reproducibility, 
describing the concept, why it should be adopted, and how it can be realistically implemented. 
This bit echoes a larger debate that relates to the very core of what Science is about and how to 
keep it serving society in the 21st century, and its inclusion in the book is a reassuring sign of the 
forward-looking attitude of the editors. 
There is much to like in this book. For a domain so wide, diverse, and eclectic as geocomputation, 
the selection of topics does a remarkable job of capturing some key themes, applications, and domains 
where geocomputational approaches are used and useful. This is further enhanced by the fact that 
the text lives up to the "practical" in its title: instead of delving into the thorough math underlying 
many of these techniques, each chapter presents the intuition and application, making it a very 
suitable companion for a graduate seminar in social sciences (e.g., economics or sociology), or for 
researchers from different disciplines with an interest in what geocomputation has to offer to them. 
Part of this success in meeting its own goals is undoubtedly related to the fact that the authors are 
among the key leaders in the field they are writing about, and thus are particularly well placed 
to write introductory texts that get to the essence without much of the underlying math. However, 
this is nicely complemented by a short section at the end of each chapter with a few key references 
for the interested reader to continue learning about the topic. Most of these do include some of the 
equation-heavy books and articles required to master these techniques, making the book a perfect 
introduction-a primer after all-with a clear path forward for the interested minds. 
At a more global level, the book recognizes and embraces many of the "big picture" shifts 
occurring in the field and accommodates them throughout the book. In addition to the already 
mentioned new approaches to geocomputational software and tools, there is an explicit recognition 
that the data landscape is changing and that this will require adaptation to be able to extract 
the most value and knowledge. This is very clear in parts of the book, such as chapter 9 (Miller), </p>

<p>which recognize the need to accommodate and properly represent these new forms of data. But 
it is also more subtly present in the choice of methods reviewed. For example, the inclusion of a 
chapter on self-organizing maps, a machine learning technique to reduce data dimensionality and 
visualize large complex datasets, is very much in that same spirit. Very welcome is also the role 
given by the editors to visualization. One could argue that graphics have always been an essential 
part of GIS and, by extension, geocomputation. However, it is easy to get lost in the complexity and 
computational aspects of some of the methodologies and assume that because the results come from 
very complicated techniques, the presentation of such results is of secondary importance. The book 
takes a clear stance on this and recognizes not only its importance, but its nontriviality, including 
chapters that walk the reader through some of the cutting-edge tools such as R, <rs type="software">Python</rs>, or <rs type="software">JavaScript</rs> 
libraries for the web. 
As much as there is to praise about this edited volume, one can always wish for more. Arguably, 
the following are a reflection of my own interests and preferences, but I do think they would have 
made the book a slightly more complete and consistent one. I have two main remarks: one relating to 
the structure and the other one to the content. I think there could have been a bit more consistency 
in the structure of each chapter. While some chapters are practical applications of a particular 
method, others are a more conceptual overview. To some extent, this is unavoidable in an edited 
volume with so many and varied authors, and some would argue even desirable as it exposes the 
reader to a larger range of approaches and ways of understanding the field, and I agree. However, 
I think a more consistent presentation of different methods provides a better way to introduce the 
unfamiliar reader to a family of new techniques. I would have also enjoyed some discussion of how 
geocomputation does or should engage with the nascent discipline of data science. Data science is in 
some ways a buzz term around which there is much hype and in that sense, it is correct not to give 
it much attention as the risk of the fashion fading soon is too high. However, the strong emphasis 
it places on practical applications and the use of data and quantitative techniques in industry and 
policy warrant some respect. A chapter on how geocomputation fits into the field of data science and 
how this can help make the discipline even more useful and valuable would have been very welcome. 
Geocomputation is a vibrant field that is constantly reimagining and reinventing itself, in-
fluenced by several technological and scientific advances, but also feeding back into those arenas. 
Because of that, the discipline should be of interest not only for experts on these computational 
techniques, but also to a wide variety of students and researchers in the natural and social sciences. 
Particularly for those, the book is an excellent introduction that will provide a good overview of what 
is on offer, and how to make the most of it. </p>

additionally uses the average of the log2-transformed 
signal values (M) corresponding to one gene and, 
roughly speaking, generates a bias function, possibly 
different for every mEM. LOWESS parameters used

Because a majority of the data did not follow a normal 
distribution, all results presented herein are expressed as 
the median and interquartile range (IQR) or the number 
(percentage) of patients. Categorical variables were

Continuous variables were analyzed using a <rs type="software">Mann-
Whitney U-test</rs>. Multiple logistic regression was per-
formed to assess the effects of independent factors on 
final treatment outcome (excluding uncertain outcomes). 
Variables with a p value less than 0.2 in the univariate

<p>Background: The lung cancer mortality rate in Xuanwei city is among the high-
est in China and adenocarcinoma is the major histological type. Lung cancer has 
been associated with exposure to indoor smoky coal emissions that contain high 
levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; however, the pathogenesis of lung 
cancer has not yet been fully elucidated. 
Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing with lung adenocarcinoma 
and corresponding non-tumor tissue to explore the genomic features of Xuanwei 
lung cancer. We used the <rs type="software">Molecule Annotation System</rs> to determine and plot 
alterations in genes and signaling pathways. 
Results: A total of 3 428 060 and 3 416 989 single nucleotide variants were 
detected in tumor and normal genomes, respectively. After comparison of these 
two genomes, 977 high-confidence somatic single nucleotide variants were identi-
fied. We observed a remarkably high proportion of CÁG-AÁT transversions. 
HECTD4, RCBTB2, KLF15, and CACNA1C may be cancer-related genes. Nine 
copy number variations increased in chromosome 5 and one in chromosome 
7. The novel junctions were detected via clustered discordant paired ends and 
1955 structural variants were discovered. Among these, we found 44 novel chro-
mosome structural variations. In addition, EGFR and CACNA1C in the mitogen-
activated protein kinase signaling pathway were mutated or amplified in lung 
adenocarcinoma tumor tissue. 
Conclusion: We obtained a comprehensive view of somatic alterations of Xuan-
wei lung adenocarcinoma. These findings provide insight into the genomic land-
scape in order to further learn about the progress and development of Xuanwei 
lung adenocarcinoma. </p>

<p>Genomic reads were initially mapped to the reference 
genome using a fast algorithm. These initial mappings were 
both expanded and refined by a form of local de novo 
assembly in all regions of the genome that appeared to 
contain variations based on these initial mappings. The de 
novo assembly fully leverages mate-pair information, 
allowing reads to be recruited into variants with higher 
sensitivity than genome-wide mapping methods alone typi-
cally provide. Assemblies were diploid, and sequencing 
produced two separate result sequences for each locus in 
diploid regions. Variants were called by independently 
comparing each of the diploid assemblies to the reference. 
The original computational methods for small variant 
detection are available at: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/ 
full/10.1089/cmb.2011.0201. These methods have evolved 
over the development of further <rs type="software">Analysis Pipeline</rs> versions. </p>

<p>Predicted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 
compared using National Center for Biotechnology Infor-
mation (NCBI) dbSNP version 137 to annotate known 
SNP information. Each SNP was mapped on the genomic 
features of the UCSC gene table, such as coding region, 
untranslational region, and intron. Non-synonymous SNP 
information was extracted by comparing UCSC reference 
gene information (http://genome.Ucsc.edu/). Information 
on cancer-related mutations was obtained from the cosmic 
cancer information database (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/ 
cancergenome/projects/cosmic/). The Ingenuity <rs id="software-2" type="software">Molecule 
Annotation System (MAS</rs>) (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/mas3</rs>/) was used for functional interaction analysis of the 
genes affected. The MAS is a whole data-mining and func-
tion annotation solution used to extract and analyze bio-
logical molecule relationships from a public knowledge 
base of biological molecules and signification. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">MAS</rs> was used to determine and plot the alterations of 
genes and signaling pathways. Indeed, two genes in the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling path-
way, EGFR and CACNA1C, were found either mutated or 
amplified in lung adenocarcinoma tissue (Fig S2) and other 
cancer-related pathways also harbored multiple mutations 
(Fig S3). Activation of the MAPK pathway can result in a </p>

and December 2013 were analyzed. Prevalence trends 
refer to rates over time of diagnosed seropositive cases 
of hepatitis B. The carriage rate for a certain yea, or 
demographic group (gender, age group) was calculated 
by dividing the number of reported seropositive cases 
for hepatitis B for that year, or demographic group by 
the corresponding estimated population for that year, 
or demographic group, then multiplied to give the rate 
per 100,000. All data were analyzed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical

and the respective 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
the decline in hepatitis B prevalence between 2004 and 
2013. We used the 2004 prevalence for reference to 
calculate the OR and p-values compared with this year.

<p>with an already present receiving hand. The conditions were love 
(hands caressing), pain (one hand hitting the other), social exclusion 
(one hand pushing away the other friendly hand), and neutral videos 
(approaching hand touching the other and getting a non-emotional 
response). A duplicate of every video was left-right mirrored (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Adobe</rs> 
<rs id="software-4" type="software">Premiere</rs>) to ensure that hands entered equally often from both sides. 
Subjects were instructed to watch the videos as if they were watching 
one of their favourite videos. They were told that a question would be 
asked later and that they could answer it if they had watched (not 
memorized) the videos carefully. Two event-related runs ($8 min) con-
sisted of 36 videos (nine instances of each condition), separated by a </p>

<p>Whole cerebrum activity was measured using a Philips Intera 3 T 
Quaser, eight-channel head coil, 32 axial gradient-echo slices, 3 mm 
thickness, no gap, single shot echo planar imaging, echo time: 30 ms, 
repetition time: 1.5 s. Slices were aligned to the anterior commissure-
posterior commissure line. The first five scans were discarded (T 1 equi-
libration). A T 1 -weighted image was also acquired (repetition time: 
7.55 ms, echo time: 3.5 ms, flip angle, field of view: 224; 160; 256, 
matrix 256 Â 229, voxel size: 1 Â 1 Â 1 mm). The total acquisition 
lasted $47 min. 
Images were analysed with <rs id="software-5" type="software">SPM5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5</rs>). For each subject, echo planar images were 
aligned to each other; the T 1 co-registered to the mean echo planar 
image and normalization parameters (obtained from T 1 segmentation) 
applied to all echo planar images (3 Â 3 Â 3 mm resolution), followed 
by smoothing (9 mm Gaussian kernel). Echo planar images were high-
pass filtered at 300 s. A separate general linear model was used for 
each experiment. 
At the subject level, observation was modelled with separate pre-
dictors for love, pain, exclusion, and neutral videos as boxcar functions 
convolved with the haemodynamic response function. The same was 
done for experience, with the addition of a fifth predictor modelling 
the rating epochs. For empathy, four separate regressors were used for 
empathizing with the receiving and approaching hand in the love and 
pain conditions. 
Summary volumes per condition, subject and experiment were then 
brought to the population analysis level to assess whether the groups 
differed for at least one condition (Pain, Love, Neutral, Exclusion for 
Experience and Observation; Pain-Receive, Pain-Approach, Love-
Receive, Love-Approach for Empathy). This was done in an ANOVA 
including two groups and four conditions, using the F contrast [1 0 0 0 
À1 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0 0 À 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0 0 0 À1 0; 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 À1] 
(first four columns represent conditions of the control group, last four 
those of the psychopathy group). We then explored the interaction 
Group Â Condition (F-contrast: [1 À 1 0 0 À 1 1 0 0; 0 1 À1 0 0 À1 
1 0; 0 0 1 À1 0 0 À 1 1]). Given that this interaction was not sig-
nificant in observation and empathy, we summed the four conditions 
to explore the main effect of group (F: [1 1 1 1 À1 À1 À1 À1]). We 
then performed T-tests to determine which group had stronger activa-
tions (T: [ À 1 À1 À1 À 1 1 1 1 1] and the reverse contrast). ANOVAs 
in SPM use a general linear model approach, which pools the error 
variance, and are valid for inferences across groups with different n. 
To assess whether the instructions to empathize significantly 
changed the group differences, we performed an interaction analysis </p>

<p>(i) We selected studies and meta-analyses that included an experi-
ence and an observation condition of actions, sensations or emo-
tions and selected the regions most consistently activated by 
experience and observation. Whenever possible we then used 
the <rs type="software">Anatomy ToolBox</rs> (Eickhoff et al., 2007) or the <rs corresp="#software-7" type="creator">AAL</rs> atlas 
of the <rs id="software-7" type="software">WFU Pickatlas</rs> (Maldjian et al., 2003) for regions not yet 
included in the Anatomy ToolBox and then combined them into a 
single composite anatomical region of interest using a logical 'OR' 
(Fig. 2, blue transparent regions). These anatomical regions, 
defined using <rs type="software">Anatomy ToolBox</rs> included the premotor cortices 
(Brodmann area 6 in Anatomy ToolBox) (Gazzola and Keysers, 
2009; Caspers et al., 2010), the primary and secondary somato-
sensory cortices (SI = BA3a + b + BA1 + BA2 and SII = OP1 + 
OP2 + OP3 + OP4) (Keysers et al., 2010). Those defined using 
the AAL included the insula and the anterior/mid cingulate 
(Wicker et al., 2003; Singer et al., 2004, 2006; Jabbi et al., 
2007; Bastiaansen et al., 2009; Lamm et al., 2011). 
(ii) We used the results from our localizer experiment (i.e. experi-
ence) to select voxels that were significantly activated by at least 
one of our stimuli by either one of the groups (Fig. 2, red

comparing the four summary volumes (love, pain, neutral, exclu-

Viral RNA profiling. RNA was isolated and analyzed by real-
time qPCR for all KSHV mRNAs as previously described (18). All 
primers have a predicted melting temperature (T m ) of 60 Ϯ 1°C. 
Real-time qPCR was conducted under universal cycling condi-
tions (40 cycles) with SYBR green dye as the method of detection. 
The final primer concentration was 250 nM in a total 20.0-l 
reaction. Total RNA was isolated using triazole (Sigma, Inc.) and 
subjected to DNase I treatment (Zymed, Inc.). RNA was reverse 
transcribed using a cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). 
RNA integrity was evaluated using an <rs id="software-0" type="software">Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer 
series C and software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Agilent, Inc.</rs>.) and qPCR conducted on an 
Opticon-2 MJR instrument (Bio-Rad Inc.). The instrument error 
was Յ6%. Control reactions (reverse transcriptase [RT] negative) 
were uniformly negative. All measurements were conducted in 
triplicate. 
The mean cycle threshold (C T ) values, representing relative 
mRNA abundance on a log 2 scale, were first normalized to KSHV 
latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) mRNA and then stan-
dardized (Z-transformation [29]) to the median of each biopsy 
specimen. We did not find a correlation between variability of 
gene expression as measured by SD and overall expression levels 
(data not shown). This demonstrates that the data were not bi-
ased. 
Unsupervised clustering was conducted using Arrayminer 
(Optimaldesign, Inc.). Additional calculations were performed in 
R, version 2.5.0. The linear trend was computed using robust re-
gression (30). </p>

<p>Moreover, the cost of prescription contraception 
is relatively expensive, especially for young 
adults whose incomes tend to be lower than 
other groups. For example, Trussell et al. (2013) 
estimates the average annual cost of short-acting 
prescription contraception to be $390.53 for 
injections, $654.30 for the birth control pill, 
and $1,023.86 for the birth control patch. 1 The 
reported spike in requests and <rs type="software">Google</rs> searches 
for intrauterine devices immediately after the 
2016 election is strong, although admittedly 
anecdotal, evidence of the importance women 
place on having the cost of their contraception 
covered (Ross 2016). 
Health insurance policies that include contra-
ception coverage are likely valued more highly by 
young women than policies that do not, which in 
turn may lead to greater take-up and strengthens 
the effects of a YAD mandate. Similarly, Raissian 
and Lopoo (2015) note that CMs only help those 
women who have insurance; thus, a CM may have 
stronger effects in states where young women 
have better access to health insurance, such as 
provided by a YAD mandate. Even if these man-
dates do not combine to increase health insurance 
coverage, they could still combine to affect the 
care women receive and their health outcomes. 
For example, a woman covered by a YAD may 
not bother going to the doctor for routine care if 
she is using nonprescription contraception (e.g., 
condoms, spermicide); the addition of a CM may 
encourage her to seek prescription contraception 
and lead her to get such routine care, care which 
could potentially diagnose, treat, or prevent other 
health conditions (like depression). 
There are other, more indirect mechanisms 
too. Depew (2015) and Colman and Dave (2015) 
find that YADs reduce labor supply; the latter 
also find a decrease in time spent waiting for 
or receiving health care and an increase in "so-
cializing." Such second-order effects could lead 
YADs to affect both care received and health 
outcomes (indeed, Colman and Dave 2015, find 
an increase in subjective well-being) as well as 
influence reproductive behavior and the desire 
for contraception. These scenarios suggest that 
the effects of these mandates can operate through </p>

<p>Objectives: The aim of the present study was to develop a plate to treat mandibular angle fractures using the finite element 
method and mechanical testing. 
Material and Methods: A three-dimensional model of a fractured mandible was generated using <rs type="software">Rhinoceros 4.0 software</rs>. 
The models were exported to ANSYS </p>

<p>The computer model of the mandible was constructed 
using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Rhinoceros 4.0 software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">McNeel North America, Seattle, WA</rs>) and was based on a previous 
three-dimensional model of a mandible taken from 
a data bank. The data bank model was created using 
images from the Multislice Helical Computed 
Tomography of human jaws (volunteers), with a 
cutting thickness of 1 mm [6]. The mandible was 
cut in the right side angle area to simulate a fracture 
with bone loss. In this model, the teeth were removed 
to simplify the modelling, and a geometric reference 
was created in the location of the right first molar </p>

<p>(Tóride Indústria e Comércio Ltd, Mogi-Mirim, São 
Paulo -Brazil). The three-dimensional geometry of 
the plates and screws was created using <rs type="software">Rhinoceros 
4.0 software</rs>. One 2 mm locking plate was developed 
based on information acquired from the literature 
regarding stress distribution and the use of a single 
tension band plate in mandibular angle fractures [7,8]. 
The plate was modelled using SolidWorks 
® 2012 X64 
edition SP02 (Dassault Systèmes S.A, USA). This 
model was imported to Rhinoceros 4.0 and adjusted 
for the mandible model. 
The mandibular fracture was fixed by three techniques 
of internal fixation: in Group I, one 4-hole 2 mm 
superior border plate was fixed with four screws with 
a 2 mm outer thread diameter (OTD) and a length of 
6 mm, while one 6-hole 2 mm inferior border plate 
was fixed with six 2 mm OTD, 12 mm long screws; 
in Group II, one 4-hole 2 mm locking superior 
border plate was fixed with four 2 mm OTD, 6 mm 
long locking screws, while one 6-hole 2 mm locking 
inferior border plate was fixed with six 2 mm OTD, 
12 mm long locking screws; in Group III, one newly 
designed 8-hole 2 mm locking plate was fixed with 
eight 2 mm OTD, 6 mm long locking screws. 
Each plate and screw needed to be in perfect contact 
with the bone. An attempt was made to place the 
plates according to standard clinical practice. Screws 
connecting the plates to the mandible were modelled 
without threads, with a diameter of 2 mm and a length 
that was appropriate for monocortical penetration 
(6 mm) on the superior border and bicortical 
penetration (12 mm) on the inferior border. 
The geometry was imported to the Ansys 
® 14.0.1. 2.0 
Framework (ANSYS 
® Inc., Houston, USA) to pre-
process the finite element model. All of the materials 
were considered to be homogenous, isotropic and 
linear elastic [9]. We elected to model the bone 
geometry as one homogeneous phase, similar to 
the synthetic material used to produce the mandible 
applied in the mechanical tests (polyurethane). The 
properties used for the polyurethane mandibular 
substratum were based on an isotropic Young´s 
modulus of 624.42 MPa and a Poisson´s ratio of 
0.2817 [10]. The properties of the titanium plates 
and screws followed the data provided by the 
manufacturer: the screws were made of Titanium alloy 
(Titanium-6Aluminum-4Vanadium; ASTM F-136) 
and the plates were made of commercially pure 
Titanium (ASTM F67) (Table 1). </p>

<p>Statistics 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">MedCalc</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">MedCalc Software</rs>, Ostend, Belgium) 
was used for statistical analysis. 
Reliability was assessed using 10 randomly selected paired 
scans, each measured in triplicate by 2 independent observ-
ers at different times. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 
scores showed highly reliable intra-rater and inter-rater reli-
ability for all measurements using CTS and LLR (defined by 
ICC &gt; 0.81 according to guidance set out by Altman, 1990) 
(Table). 
The correlation between CTS and LLR was quantified using 
Pearson's correlation coefficient. Paired-samples t-tests were 
used to assess the statistical significance of the mean difference 
seen in measurements between CTS and LLR. The agreement 
between CTS and LLR was quantified using Bland-Altman 
plots, demonstrated by 1.96 standard deviation limits of agree-
ment (LOA). These plots are shown in Figures 2-5. </p>

<p>A 0.5-ml aliquot of hexane (Sigma) was added to the samples 
and vortexed for 30 sec. Samples were left on ice for 10 min and 
the vortexing was repeated 2 times. At the end of the extraction, 
samples were removed from the ice and centrifuged at 12,000 
rpm for 1 min. A 0.2-ml aliquot of the organic layer was spiked 
with trans, trans-2,4-nonadienal (Sigma) as internal standard at 
a final concentration of 200 ppm, and 1 μl of the spiked sample 
was injected into the GC-MS running in the full scan mode. 
Overall, 6 plants and 6 leaves from each were used for each treat-
ment and two runs/replicate were performed. 
GC-MS analysis 
Citrus leaf volatiles were analyzed using a Clarus 500 GC-MS 
system (Perkin Elmer) fitted with an HP-5MS column (cross-
linked 5% Ph Me siloxane, 50 min × 0.22 mm × 0.025 μm film 
thickness). The flow rate for the helium carrier gas was 0.7 ml/ 
min. The following GC temperature program was used: hold at 
50 °C for 3 min, then increase to 200 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, 
increase further to 250 °C at 10 °C/min, and finally hold at 250 
°C for 2 min.22 The injector and the detector temperatures were 
250 °C and 180 °C, respectively.

<p>180 eyes of 140 consecutive patients were evaluated in 
this retrospective cross sectional pilot study. Copernicus 
SD-OCT with resolution of 3 mm obtained through the 
ONH were included. All examined eyes were divided into 
four groups. The size of the disc, the volume of cup, cup/ 
disc ratio (E/D), size of the rim and the thickness of the 
RNFL were observed in 50 normal eyes ( control group 
without glaucoma), 50 eyes with the signs of initial open 
angle glaucoma, 50 eyes with developed simple glaucoma 
and 30 eyes with terminal glaucoma signs (final glauco-
matous atrophy). 
Mean anatomical values within diagnostic categories 
were compared using one way analysis of variance and 
multivariable analysis. Bivariate analysis was used to in-
vestigate relationships between evident variables and sig-
nificant ( p&lt;0,05) relationships. These results were incor-
porated in the final statistical conclusion. 
All variables were expressed for categorical data as the 
means±s.e.m. or medians and interquartile ranges for 
continuous data with or without a normal distribution, 
respectively. Normally distributed continuous variables 
were compared between groups using two-tailed-tests. 
Nonparametric data was compared between groups using 
the independent samples Mann-Whitney U-test. P-value 
&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statisti-
cal analyses were performed using the computer software

4 years for a latent duration of childhood thyroid cancer, 
corresponding to the time between the Fukushima accident 
and thyroid cancer detection, for which the maximum dura-
tion was 3 years and 10 months.

For live-cell imaging of yeast strains carrying a plasmid, cells 
were grown at 25°C in SC media lacking a specific amino acid to 
select for the presence of a plasmid. For imaging yeast strains car-
rying a chs2 phosphomutation, cells were first grown in SC-LEU me-
dium to keep them healthy and then washed twice with rich me-
dium YM-1 without carbon source. Cells were then incubated 
further for 1-3 h at 25°C before being concentrated by centrifuga-
tion and spotted on a slab of YM-1 medium containing 2% agarose 
for live-cell imaging. For live-cell imaging at 37°C (Figure 6), the 
wild-type and the dbf2-1 dbf20Δ strains were grown in liquid YM-1 
media containing 2% raffinose at 25°C to the exponential phase 
and then shifted to 37°C for additional 3 h. A 2.0-ml culture was 
then transferred to a 3.5-mm dish coated with polylysine (MatTek, 
Ashland, MA), which was incubated in the 37°C chamber of the 
microscope for 20 min to let the cells settle down. A 1.5-ml culture </p>

<p>was then removed from the dish, which was 
followed by the addition of a 1.5-ml pre-
warmed YM-1 medium containing 2% 
raffinose, 3% galactose, and 1.5% low-melt-
ing agarose. Images were acquired at 25 or 
37°C on a spinning disk confocal micro-
scope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU 10 
scan head combined with an Olympus IX 71 
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and 
an Olympus 100× objective (1.4 numerical

EMCCD camera (model C9100-13, Bridge-
water, NJ) was used for capture. Diode la-
sers for excitation (488 nm for GFP and 561 
nm for mCherry/RFP) were housed in a 
launch constructed by Spectral Applied Re-
search (Richmond Hill, Canada). Images 
were taken every minute with z-stacks rang-
ing from 11 × 0.3 to 12 × 0.5 μm. A maxi-

els in different chs2 phosphomutants (Figure

tensity at the bud neck was divided by 
Chs2-GFP signal intensity at the bud neck. 
For the experiments involving FRAP, 
cells were grown to exponential phase in 
SC-HIS media at 23°C. Cells were then cen-
trifuged and resuspended in 10 ml YM-1 
medium and grown for at least another 3 h 
in a 50-ml flask at 25°C in a water-bath 
shaker. One milliliter of this culture was 
taken to concentrate the cells by centrifuga-
tion. Cells were then spotted on YM-1 me-
dium containing 2% agarose for FRAP and 
imaging analysis. FRAP was performed us-
ing a Micro Point computer-controlled abla-
tion system (Photonic Instruments, St. Charles, IL) consisting of 
a nitrogen-pumped dye laser (wavelength, 435 nm) controlled by 
<rs type="software">MetaMorph</rs>. In some cases, sequential photobleaching was ap-
plied (Figure 5A, S217D). Images were captured and processed us-
ing the same microscope, camera, and software as described ear-
lier. Images were taken every 20 s with a z-stack consisting of 12 ×

after the cautery operation, as described above. After washing the surface by gentle 
vortexing in PBS, the tissue was soaked in PBS containing Fluo-4 AM (Dojindo, 
Kumamoto, Japan) at a final concentration of 10 mM with brief sonication. Fluo-4 
AM was allowed to enter the cells for 20 min, and the tissue was then washed in PBS. 
The tissue was sandwiched by two thin glasses in PBS and observed. The real-time 
confocal microscope imaging system used in this study was composed of an inverted 
epifluorescence microscope Eclipse Ti-U (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), a CSU-X1 laser-
scanning unit with a 520612.5 nm band-pass filter (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan), and 
an ImagEM EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The

set at 100 ms with a 1.0 s interval. Autofluorescence from non-damaged tissues with 
or without fluo-4 loading and from damaged tissues without loading was found to be 
minimal or null. </p>

<p>thematic saturation) (Ritchie and Lewis, 2003). R.K. interviewed 
the neurologists at a time and place of their choosing, the 
interview taking between 35 and 70 min. These were 'depth 
interviews' which employed a topic guide to provide a bare 
structure, with the material covered adapted to each interview. 
The subject was 'conversion disorder' and no definition of this 
was offered by the interviewer. The topics included the neurolo-
gist's background, training and current practice, examples of 
memorable or current patients considered to have 'conversion 
disorder', the neurologist's definitions, exclusions, models and 
diagnostic practices. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded and 
transcribed, and were inductively analysed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">NVIVO</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">7</rs> 
software. Transcripts were coded by question, and, iteratively, 
by emerging themes, consistent with an approach known as 
grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). The study was 
approved by the local research ethics committee, and all the 
participants gave written, informed consent. 
Twenty-two neurologists were interviewed, from a potential 
pool of 35 in the region. Their ages ranged from 39 to 
63 years, with a median age of 45. Seven were female, 15 
were male. Seventeen were white, two were from the Middle 
East and three from the Indian subcontinent. They had been 
medically qualified for 14-39 years (median 20 years), received 
their medical training in the UK (15), other developed countries 
(five) and the Indian subcontinent (two). Two had been mature 
medical students. Five had worked as psychiatrists earlier in their 
training (for between 6 weeks and 3 years), eight had worked on 
a national neuropsychiatry service (as neurologists) and two had 
pursued research in psychiatry. In terms of current work, all were 
attached to a regional neuroscience centre in London, with most 
working in district general hospitals in other counties for the bulk 
of their practice. Three held academic appointments, but all with 
substantial clinical commitments. All were 'general' neurologists, 
except for one who saw only headache, one who worked only 
with movement disorders and three who worked largely or 
exclusively with epilepsy. </p>

<p>IIV was assessed on all structural model parameters, as was 
interoccasion variability (the occasion variable was derived 
based on the visit number: it was assumed that concentra-
tions measured at different study visits represented distinct 
occasions). The pharmacokinetic parameters (k a , volumes, 
and clearances) were assumed to be log-normally distrib-
uted around the population mean, but the random effects to 
describe both IIV and interoccasion variability were assumed 
to be distributed with a mean of zero. The effects of covari-
ates (age, BMI, creatinine clearance, sex, FEV 1 % predicted 
at baseline, and weight) on the pharmacokinetic model were 
investigated once an adequate structural and stochastic model 
had been finalized. Age was categorized into three groups: 
6-11, 12-17, and ≥18 years. Each covariate was tested indi-
vidually against the key structural model parameters k a , V d /F, 
and CL/F in a stepwise fashion (forward inclusion). After each 
step, the strongest covariate relationship was incorporated 
into the model, and the others sequentially and individually 
retested, until no further covariates could be added with statis-
tical significance. The inclusion of a covariate term was consid-
ered statistically significant if it produced a difference of 3.84 
(P = 0.05, given a single degree of freedom) in the <rs type="software">NONMEM</rs> 
objective function value during the forward inclusion and if it 
produced an objective function value difference of 6.64 (P = 
0.01, given a single degree of freedom) during the backward 
elimination. A combination of proportional and additive error 
models was used. The visual predictive check was used to 
provide an assessment of the model's ability to describe the 
data and the model's suitability for simulation. For the covari-
ates identified after the stepwise process, 1,000 simulations 
were performed to evaluate their effect on the drug exposure 
at steady state using the following metrics: C max and C trough . The 
sensitivity of each metric to a given covariate was evaluated 
by simulation using different percentile values of the covariate 
distribution in the pharmacokinetic population, while keeping 
values of the other identified covariates in the model fixed at 
their median values in the pharmacokinetic population. These 
simulations were undertaken using the population parameter 
estimates from the final model and the IIV values of pharmaco-
kinetic parameters, and they yielded the metrics of interest and 
their 95% predictive intervals. Further details of the modeling 
methods can be found in the Supplementary appendix. </p>

We measured waist circumference just

using a Hoechstmass measuring tape 
(Hoechstmass Balzer, Sulzbach, Ger-
many). Research assistants followed stan-

biannual in-service training to ensure 
measurement validity (IJ Shorr; Shorr

<p>Functional annotation for iRC1080 was performed using a consensus 
of two separate approaches. In the first approach, gene models (http:// 
augustus.gobics.de/predictions/chlamydomonas/augustus.u5.aa) from 
the Augustus update 5 (Au5) of C. reinhardtii genome assembly 
version JGI v4.0 were functionally annotated by assigning enzyme 
classification (EC) terms using BLASTP results against UniProt (http:// 
www.uniprot.org/) and AraCyc (http://www.arabidopsis.org/biocyc/) 
enzyme protein sequences and their EC annotations as the basis. The 
second approach followed from mapping of Au5 gene models 
to annotated JGI v3.1 gene models, for which EC terms and Gene 
Ontology annotation were assigned using a combination of BLASTP, 
AutoFACT, <rs type="software">InterProScan</rs>, and PRIAM. The comprehensive annotation 
is presented in Supplementary Table S3. See Supplementary informa-
tion for full details. </p>

<p>ORF amplicons were generated from C. reinhardtii cells by RT-PCR 
from RNA or PCR from Gateway clones. The Roche 454FLX Titanium 
sequencing system was used for sequencing of the generated ORF 
amplicons according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gener-
ated data were processed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">GS FLX</rs> data analysis software v<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">2.3</rs>. 
Minimum overlap length of 40 nucleotides and minimum overlap 
identity of 90% were used to align the sequencing reads against the 
Au5 reference sequences. ORFs encoding transporter proteins were 
verified by capillary Sanger sequencing. </p>

<p>The target accrual for the correlative serum study was 
160 patients to give an 80% power to detect a 0.5 standard 
deviation (SD) difference in mean serum levels of any of 
the cytokines between patients with severe and non-severe 
symptoms, using Wilcoxon rank sum test with a 0.05 two-
sided type I error. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and rank sum 
test were used to examine the difference between groups for 
continuous variables. Fisher's exact test was used to test the 
association between categorical/binary variables. Multivari-
able linear and logistic models and generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) models were used for regression analysis. 
No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons in this 
exploratory analysis. All p values were two-sided and a p 
value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs>

<p>Quantification of consumed diet. Eggs were harvested from females caught in the 
field in Okinawa as above, and 5 larvae were randomly chosen and reared at ambient 
temperature (approximately 27uC), each in a plastic columnar centrifuge tube with an 
airtight screw cap (10 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height) to prevent leaves from 
drying. The quantity of leaves eaten by each larva was monitored every day. One piece 
of leaf removed from the stalk was supplied at a time. Before being given to a larva, the 
leaf piece was weighed. Additionally, its image was taken by an image scanner, and its 
area was measured using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageJ</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">1.44p</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">U. S. National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</rs>/, 1997-2012). After being 
eaten, the remaining leaf was replaced every day with a fresh leaf. The area of the 
remaining leaf was measured every day, and its value was converted into weight, based 
on the proportion of the original leaf represented by the remnant. This process 
ensured that the weight eaten each day was recorded as the weight of the fresh leaf. </p>

<p>Mortality and abnormality rates. The mortality rate was defined as the percentage of 
dead individuals at all stages relative to the total number of individuals reared. Thus, 
the mortality rate excluded only normal adults. In contrast, the abnormality rate 
reported here could be more accurately called the total abnormality rate. This rate was 
the percentage of dead individuals at the larval, prepupal, and pupal stages plus the 
adults that had morphological abnormalities relative to the total number of 
individuals reared. Thus, the abnormality rate excluded only normal adults that 
lacked any morphological abnormalities. Correlation analysis was performed using 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">Microsoft Excel</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2013</rs>) and <rs id="software-2" type="software">JSTAT</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">13.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-date">2012</rs>) (Yokohama, Japan). </p>

<p>Mathematical modeling. We first used the built-in mathematical fit function of 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">Microsoft Excel</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-date">2013</rs>) to obtain the best-fit curves among available models. All 
possible models were examined including linear, exponential, logarithmic, 
polynomial, and power function models, and the best possible fit in terms of R 
2 values 
and biological justification was considered to be the most appropriate. Based on 
equations obtained in this way, we manually calculated the half lethal dose and the 
half abnormal dose by setting y 5 50(%). Additionally, linear and nonlinear models 
were examined using the model analysis software <rs id="software-4" type="software">JMP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">11.0.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-date">2013</rs>) (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, 
Cary, NC, USA). We reasoned that the simplest mathematical equation with the 
highest R 
2 value, the lowest RMSE, or the lowest information criterion, such as AIC, 
BIC, and MDL, would be accepted. We examined linear models (including 
logarithmic scales for power function) and nonlinear models (including logarithmic, 
square root, quadratic, polynomial, logistic, and exponential equations). Among the 
model fits performed, logistic 4 P models also showed high R 
2 values (R 
2 5 0.9972 
and BIC 5 19.93 for mortality rate; R 
2 5 0.9997 and BIC 5 12.31 for abnormality 
rate) in addition to the power function models, but the complicated equations with 
relatively high BIC values discouraged the use of these equations for further analysis. 
The numerical values associated with the models and calculations are shown together

<p>Abstract We present an algorithm and a corresponding <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> numerical 
toolbox to solve any form of infinite-planning horizon affine linear quadratic open-loop 
differential games. By rewriting a specific application into the standard framework one 
can use the toolbox to calculate and verify the existence of both the open-loop non-
cooperative Nash equilibrium (equilibria) and cooperative Pareto equilibrium (equi-
libria). In case there is more than one equilibrium for the non-cooperative case, the 
toolbox determines all solutions that can be implemented as a feedback strategy. Alter-
natively, the toolbox can apply a number of choice methods in order to discriminate 
between multiple equilibria. The user can predefine a set of coalition structures for 
which they would like to calculate the non-cooperative Nash solution(s). It is also 
possible to specify the relative importance of each player in any coalition structure. 
Furthermore, the toolbox offers plotting facilities as well as other options to analyse 
the outcome of the game. For instance, it is possible to disaggregate each player's 
total loss into its contributing elements. The toolbox is available as a freeware from 
the authors of this paper. </p>

<p>Many situations in, for example, economics and management are characterised by 
multiple decision makers/players who can enforce decisions that have enduring 
consequences. This often invokes coordination problems and so a natural frame-
work to analyze these kinds of problems involves dynamic game theoretical set-
tings. Dynamic game theory tries to arrive at appropriate models describing a 
dynamic process affected by different players. Depending on the specific problem 
such models can sometimes be used by an individual decision maker to opti-
mise her performance. In other cases it may serve as a starting point to intro-
duce new communication lines which may help to improve upon the outcome of 
the current process. Furthermore it is possible to analyze the robustness of play-
ers' strategies w.r.t. worst-case scenarios. To this end one can introduce "nature" 
as an additional player which tries to work against the other decision makers in a 
process. 
In, for example, policy coordination problems two basic questions usually arise: 
(i) whether policies are coordinated and, (ii) which information the participating par-
ties have. Both these points are rather unclear and, therefore, strategies for differ-
ent possible scenarios are calculated and compared with each other. Often, one of 
these scenarios is the so-called open-loop scenario. In this open-loop information sce-
nario it is assumed that all players know just the initial state of the process and the 
model structure. More specifically, it is assumed that players simultaneously deter-
mine their actions for the whole planning horizon of the process before it starts. 
Next they submit their actions to some central authority who then enforces these 
plans as binding commitments. In other words, players cannot react on any devi-
ations occurring during the evolution of the process. Obviously, since according 
to this scenario the participating parties can not react to each other's policies, its 
economic relevance is mostly rather limited. However, as a benchmark to see how 
much parties can gain by playing other strategies, its role is fundamental. Due to its 
analytic tractability the open-loop Nash equilibrium strategy is in particular very pop-
ular for problems where the underlying model can be described by a (set of) linear 
differential equation(s) and the individual objectives can be approximated by func-
tions that quadratically penalise deviations from some (equilibrium) targets. Exam-
ples and additional references of differential games in economics and management 
science can be found e.g. in Dockner et al. (2000), Jørgensen and Zaccour (2003) 
and Plasmans et al. (2006). 
Under the assumption that the parties have a finite-planning horizon, the linear 
quadratic differential game was first modeled and solved in a mathematically rigorous 
way by Starr and Ho (1969a,b). A recent exposition (and additional references) on lin-
ear quadratic differential games can be found in Engwerda (2005), whereas Başar and 
Olsder (1999) give a good overview and introduction on dynamic games in general. 
In the rest of this paper we will concentrate on the case that the players base 
their decisions on a performance criterion that has an infinite-planning horizon. We 
will present an algorithm and a corresponding <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> numerical toolbox which 
solves any form of an infinite-planning horizon affine linear quadratic open-loop 
differential game. The software, called <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs>, is available as a freeware </p>

<p>Step A2 in the above algorithm verifies whether the algebraic Riccati equations 
(20) have a stabilizing solution. Of course one can use here <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> to verify this. 
Concerning the numerical stability of Algorithm 5 we notice that various sugges-
tions have been made in the literature to calculate solutions of Riccati equations in 
a numerically reliable way (see e.g. Laub (1979, 1991), Paige and van Loan (1981), 
van Dooren (1981), Mehrmann (1991) and Abou-Kandil and Bertrand (1986) for a 
more general survey on various types of Riccati equations). These methods can also be </p>

<p>Next we proceed with an outline of the numerical toolbox. The software verifies the 
existence of and, provided that a finite number of equilibria exists, calculates the 
outcome of the N -player extension of the game (1-3). The scheme presenting all 
the components of the toolbox software is displayed in Fig. 1. The main file, called 
<rs type="software">LQDGsolver.exe</rs>, solves the LQDG which is to be defined in the input. The input file 
can be created by the user using an intuitive input interface provided (file <rs type="software">TBXinput-
GUI.exe</rs>). Alternatively, more proficient users might choose to create the input file 
directly (in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> or text formats). <rs type="software">LQDGsolver</rs> produces the following output 
for every coalition structure considered: </p>

<p>The above output is saved in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> and text formats in a directory that corre-
sponds to the chosen name of the project. The following output files are created: </p>

<p>• PROJECT_NAME_model.txt: text file containing the structural and reduced form 
of the dynamic system; 
• inputPROJECT_NAME.m: binary <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> file containing (processed) input to 
the project; 
• PROJECT_NAME_validation.txt: text file containing all the information about the 
various stages of model validation; 
• PROJECT_NAME_output.txt: text file containing all the output produced; and 
• outputPROJECT_NAME.m: binary <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> file containing all the project's 
output. </p>

<p>The plotting tool is provided that uses the above output to draw the dynamics of 
every variable in the model for a chosen coalition structure and equilibrium. Less 
advanced users can use a simple output interface (file <rs type="software">TBXoutputGUI.exe</rs>) that allows </p>

<p>Step T1: <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> Initialisation To define the LQDG problem the user is sup-
posed to provide a number of compulsory components of the model. As it has been 
mentioned before, it is the most convenient to use the interface provided in order to 
create the project. The main window of the user interface is shown in Fig. 2. More 
proficient users also may create the input file directly in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> or text formats. 
Compulsory components of the LQDG problem include: 
• the name of the new project; 
• number of players, number of state and output variables, whether the model include 
constant or not; 
• the number of control instruments per player; 
• the nonzero P i and P i j matrices from the structural form model (30-31); 
• the parameters from the performance criterion (32); 
• the initial condition p 0 ; and 
• the coalition structures to be considered. 8 
• If the model includes constants, i.e., at least one element of matrices P 5 and P 10 
is non-zero, then it is mandatory to specify a strictly positive discount rate. </p>

<p>8 For less than 6 players <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> has predefined sets of all coalition structures so that the user does 
not have to define them himself. </p>

<p><rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> offers an opportunity to control and verify every important 
intermediate step of the solution process as well as the results obtained. The list of all 
the available options can be edited in the user interface. </p>

<p>Step T2: Model Validation by <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> Based on the input that is provided in 
Step A1, the toolbox verifies various regularity conditions: </p>

<p>Step T1: <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> Initialisation The above maximisation problems can be 
rewritten in terms of (32) as: </p>

<p>Step T2: Model Validation by <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> With this input the toolbox next cal-
culates the standard form (17-18) by considering the new variables: </p>

<p>Step T1: <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> Initialisation We can rewrite the above example to fit our 
standard model (30-31) by specifying: </p>

<p>Step T2: Model Validation by <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> With this input the toolbox next calcu-
lates the standard form (17-18). Clearly, (i) R ii &gt; 0; (ii) (A, B i ) is stabilizable; and 
(iii) G is invertible (see Appendix A for a definition of G). </p>

<p>Step T1: <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> Initialisation We can rewrite the above example to fit our 
standard model (30-31) by specifying: </p>

<p>Step T2: Model Validation by <rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> With this input, the toolbox next cal-
culates the standard form (17-18) and checks that both Q i and R i are positive definite, 
(A, B i ) are stabilizable and G is invertible. </p>

<p>In this paper we considered a dynamic linear affine structural form model that is 
affected by different players who all like to minimise their own performance criterion 
that is a quadratic affine function of the variables occurring in the model. The costs 
are assumed to be discounted over time and the considered planning horizon by the 
players is assumed to be infinite. Under the assumption that in the minimisation of 
their performance the players do not cooperate, we presented both necessary and suffi-
cient conditions under which this problem has a unique open-loop Nash equilibrium, a 
multiple but finite number of equilibria and or an infinite number of equilibria. A com-
putational framework was provided for how one can numerically solve the problem. 
The algorithm has been implemented in a form of a numerical toolbox available on 
the internet. Users, starting from the structural model, can calculate for their specific 
application the equilibrium strategies and involved cost (if they exist). The toolbox 
also provides the possibility to calculate for different coalition structures whether the 
corresponding game will have an open-loop Nash solution. For that purpose the user 
has to define which coalition structures they like to analyze and what the relative 
importance is of each player within a certain coalition. We demonstrated both theoret-
ically and numerically in a worked example on dynamic duopolistic competition the 
use of the toolbox. 
<rs type="software">LQDG Toolbox</rs> is implemented in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs>. In particular, it uses some standard 
functions of <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> to calculate the eigenstructure of a (|N |n) × (|N |n) matrix, 
where |N | is the number of involved players andn is the state dimension of the model. 
Since no additional efforts are taken to calculate this eigenstructure in a numerically 
efficient way, the practical use of the current toolbox is limited to some extent. This is 
because for either a large number of players and/or a large state dimension, the accu-
racy and efficiency is restricted by that of the implemented <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> functions. So 
for large N and/orn the user should look for an own code to implement the algorithm. 
Another way one might choose to calculate the equilibrium strategies is by using iter-
ative algorithms. In the literature a number of iterative schemes have been suggested 
(see e.g. Engwerda 2007). A disadvantage of these schemes is that on the one hand 
they do not provide an answer to the question whether the game will have a unique 
equilibrium. On the other hand these schemes may converge without providing the 
appropriate equilibrium strategy. If this happens one is stuck with the question how to 
proceed. 
For the corresponding problem with a finite planning horizon, at least from a the-
oretical point, it is clear under which conditions there exists a unique equilibrium </p>

<p>(see e.g. Engwerda 2005). From a computational point it is also clear how one can 
calculate this equilibrium. Either one can solve the involved set of nonlinear differen-
tial two-point boundary-value equations directly using standard <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> functions. 
Another possibility is to transform the involved set of Riccati differential equations 
(in the spirit of Reid (1972)) to a set of linear differential equations and then solve 
this set first (see e.g. Tabak 1975; Engwerda 2007). Since the calculations require 
the numerical solution of a set of (nonlinear) differential equations the dimension of 
the games for which one can still calculate the equilibrium actions (using standard 
<rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> functions) without problems is usually smaller than in the infinite horizon 
case. 
In the literature, also different equilibrium concepts have been studied for games 
considered above. Probably the most well-known is the feedback Nash concept. Unfor-
tunately, for this case there are no general conditions known, except for the scalar case, 
i.e.,n = 1 (see e.g. Engwerda 2005) under which the game has a unique feedback 
Nash equilibrium. 
Finally, we would like to mention that for discrete time systems much work has 
been done by <rs corresp="#software-58" type="creator">Neck et al.</rs>. in the development of the numerical software OPTGAME 
for the calculation of Nash equilibria in (non-)linear systems in case the performances 
of players are quadratic (see e.g. Neck et al. 2001). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
A power analysis was performed to ensure adequate power to 
detect differences between the WC patients who returned to 
work without restrictions and those who failed to do so. WC 
patients who returned to work without restrictions were com-
pared with those who failed to do so. WC patients were also 
compared with controls. Comparative statistical analysis of 
continuous variables was performed utilizing independent 
samples paired and unpaired t-tests. An analysis of covariance 
was subsequently performed on post-operative outcome 
scores to ensure that the observed statistical effect was not 
influenced by pre-operative baseline values. Contingency ana-
lysis was carried out with chi-squared or Fisher's exact test for 
nominal variables. A P values of less than 0.05 was considered 
to be statistically significant (<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 21</rs>, Chicago, IL). </p>

were used to evaluate the hormonal levels. The Mann-
Whitney method analysis of variance was used to evaluate 
the other parameters. Values of p＜0.05 were considered 
to be statistically significant. </p>

<p>Methods 
In the autumn of 2010, an online questionnaire was 
emailed to all the Dutch gastroenterologists (n=262) 
and residents-in-training (n=140), followed by two 
reminder emails. Eight months later, a postal mailing 
was sent to the non-responders. 
The 42-itemed questionnaire (see online supple-
mentary appendix), which was designed by a urolo-
gist (HWE) and a gastroenterologist (HHF), addressed 
pelvic floor-related complaints and the gastroenter-
ologists' beliefs and overall perceptions of pelvic floor 
complaints in relation to sexual functioning. The 
results obtained by the questions about sexual abuse 
will be published separately. 
We carried out a small pilot survey with eight gastro-
enterologists to evaluate the questionnaire and adjusted 
it accordingly. Validation of the questionnaire was not 
performed. The survey was accompanied by a letter 
explaining the objectives of the study. All data were 
collected anonymously. Demographic data included 
type of practice, medical degree (resident or gastroen-
terologist), gender and age. 
Data analysis was performed with the help of the 
medical statistics department in our centre (HP), mak-
ing use of <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> release V.<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18.0</rs> . Frequencies were used 
to estimate the prevalence of inquiring about the differ-
ent domains of the pelvic floor. Bivariate associations 
between the groups and the types of answers were cal-
culated using the Pearson χ2 procedure; two-sided p 
values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
Some questions with more than one possible answer, 
and with open answers, were grouped together for 
analysis. In The Netherlands, ethical approval is not 
required for questionnaires of this kind. </p>

<p>The teaching project based on the learning platform used 
at the University of Duisburg-Essen, "<rs id="software-0" type="software">moodle</rs>" (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://www.moodle.de</rs>/), (http://moodle.uni-duisburg-essen.de/ 
course/category.php?id=101) consists of two parts: </p>

<p>The first part allows students to reproduce the nuclear 
medicine seminars, the films used, and useful references 
and links are provided. In the second part of interested 
students can participate in a voluntary online-POL seminar 
and deepen their knowledge. The first part allows stu-
dents to revise the nuclear medicine seminars by 
providing the slides, sources and further references. In 
the second part interested students can participate in a 
voluntary online POL seminar and deepen their know-
ledge. This part of the offer was -because it is teaching 
project -deliberately designed to be passive; except for 
a forum and feedback tools there are no plans for inter-
active teaching at this level. The concept plans that 
moodle pages accompanying the seminar draw attention 
to the "active offer" (the POL area) and serve as a "lure". 
Therefore, the method of problem-oriented learning is 
described at the bottom of the page and the first POL 
case is made available on this page. Students interested 
in working on this POL case in a virtual seminar are asked 
to register by email to receive more information. Once 
there are at least 4 people interested in working on a POL 
case, a small group is formed. To conduct a virtual POL 
seminar, some basic technical knowledge or preparation 
is required from each participant. Due to the costs, a 
deliberate decision was made not to use virtual 
classrooms or a similar platforms. In our context the on-
line 
communication 
software 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">Skype</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.skype.com</rs>) and the word processing application 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">Google Docs</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://www.google.com/google-d-s/intl/de/tour1.html</rs>) were used. Both programs available free of 
charge and are already used by many people in everyday 
life. While <rs type="software">Skype</rs> provides the basis for the online meet-
ings with conference calls, the application <rs type="software">Google Docs</rs> 
has the advantage that a multitude of documents can be 
edited by different people, simultaneously or one-at-a-
time, so simple synchronous and asynchronous online 
collaboration is possible. For this purpose the tutors cre-
ate an account and provide login information for the 
students. The case process is inspired by the classic POL 
principle, which means the starting point for the students 
is a real case study from nuclear medicine. To date, three 
cases have been completed dealing with thyroid diagnos-
is, oncological positron emission tomography (PET) and 
myocardial scintigraphy. As an example, the POL module 
"Energised" on thyroid diagnosis and treatment, including 
the background information for students and tutors, the 
intended learning goals and guidelines for online 
presentation is shown in the appendix . The case is 
worked upon -following the classical POL model [12] -in 
seven steps, which are carried virtually for the most part 
(online): 
The steps to clarify basic questions of understanding, 
defining the problem, the collection of ideas and ap-
proaches, the systematic ordering of ideas and ap-
proaches are made online in a <rs type="software">Skype</rs> conference call 
under the moderation of a tutor (a specialist in nuclear 
medicine or a medical physics expert, each with at least 
5 years of teaching experience but without dedicated 
training), which ends in the formulation of learning object-</p>

<p>The educational project "Molecular Imaging"" was con-
ducted in summer 2008 for the first time. It was found 
that the "passive" part of the offer was well received in 
the last four semesters. A total of 539 students used the 
slides for revising the seminars. The "active part", which 
expects a lot of participation from the students, was 
viewed by 21 students from the 2 
nd (n=11), 3 
rd (n=8) and 
5 
th clinical semester (n=2) in five POL groups of 4-5 stu-
dents each. Except for two students all participants have 
completed the relevant course. Both drop-outs indicated 
that the course was too effort-intensive and one student 
complained that the technical conditions are inadequate. 
The technical difficulties consisted of initial problems with 
the <rs type="software">Skype</rs> conference, causing the start of the first POL-
event to be delayed by 30 minutes. Amongst the other 
19 participants, the seminars became a very active forum 
in which the students became increasingly independent. 
This was reflected, among other things, in the activity of 
the tutor who only had to intervene in one seminar on 
myocardial scintigraphy when the group wanted to place 
its main focus on coronary angiography rather than put 
nuclear medical diagnostics. Otherwise, the tutor essen-
tially only had to carry out moderating duties. Working 
through the cases on average took 6 to 7 weeks and in 
respect to the intended learning goal, the factual results 
were positive. Due to the (so far) relatively small number 
of participants, no valid comparison between the "classic 
face-to-face POL seminars" can be made. From the per-
spective of the tutors it can be said, however, that both 
the results of the students' work and the subsequent 
discussion were at a very high level. 
The virtual POL seminar had the character of a teaching 
project, so far with only relatively few participants. Accord-
ingly, our evaluation interest was not only quantitative 
but also qualitative. The starting point of this approach 
was the social scientific criticism of the quantitative sur-
vey with questionnaires, which allow mathematisation of 
the results presentation and reproducibility but with res-
ults that often remain superficial due to the suppression 
of factors or that may produce a false picture [13]. In the 
context of a complex teaching-learning situation a of lack 
of proximity to the problem and a lack of practical relev-
ance can be the result. With a qualitative survey, however, 
we chose an open results approach, which highlights the 
teaching-learning situation in its inner argumentative and </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Categorical variables were reported as percentages and 
compared by χ 
2 test, whereas continuous variables 
were reported as means and SDs and compared by ana-
lysis of variance, if normally distributed, or by the 
Kruskal-Wallis test, if not. Temporal trends were tested 
using the Cochran-Armitage test for binary variables 
and the Kendall Tau rank correlation coefficient with 
the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for continuous variables. 
The 95% CIs of the difference of percentage changes 
were evaluated using the R package <rs type="software">proCIs</rs>. Since the 
baseline patient characteristics showed significant 
changes in the five registries, we calculated a risk score 
for the 2010 MANTRA population using a logistic regres-
sion model resulting statistically significant at univariate 
analysis or considered of clinical interest. These variables 
included gender, age, diabetes, history of heart failure, 
prior stroke/transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), periph-
eral vascular disease, prior renal failure, systolic blood 
pressure, heart rate, Killip class and atrial fibrillation at 
admission. This score, evaluated on the 2010 MANTRA 
population, was also used to standardise the death rates 
for each of the previous surveys. The standardised death 
rates therefore represent the rates that would have been 
expected if the distribution of the baseline characteristics 
of each of the first four surveys had been similar to that 
of the most recent one. 
Finally, a multivariate analysis (logistic model) was 
conducted to identify the independent predictors of use 
of coronary angiography during index hospitalisation; 
variables statistically significant at univariate analysis 
were also inserted in the model: gender, age, smoking 
habits, prior acute myocardial infarction (AMI), prior 
revascularisation, history of heart failure, prior stroke/ 
TIA, prior renal failure, systolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, Killip class and atrial fibrillation at entry, admission 
to a hospital with catheterisation laboratory facilities, as 
well as study cohort (2001 as referral). 
All tests were two-sided; a p value &lt;0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. All analyses were conducted with 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">SAS</rs> system software <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">V.9.2</rs> and with the 'R' Development 
Core Team 2012. </p>

<p>The EIN is a provider-based network of practicing adult and 
pediatric infectious diseases (ID) physicians from all 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, and Canada [13]. A 10-item survey 
(Appendix 1) to evaluate current practices and knowledge was 
developed in consultation with ID physicians, hospital pharma-
cists, immunologists, and key stakeholders of the EIN. The 
survey was piloted amongst staff of the EIN. The EIN distribu-
ted the survey and study objectives between September 15 and 
October 13, 2015. An opt-out option and 2 e-mail reminders at 
1-week intervals were provided. Demographic information was 
available for each EIN respondent. 
Survey responses were analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Stata</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 13</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">StataCorp</rs>, College Station, TX) using the χ 
2 test for categorical </p>

<p>The models were built using three different approaches: 
1. Tree-based predictive models 
i. Decision trees (<rs type="software">Cubist</rs>) 
ii. Random forests (<rs type="software">randomForest</rs>) 
2. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) (<rs type="software">monmlp</rs>) 
3. Symbolic regression (<rs type="software">rgp</rs>). 
Extensive combinations of algorithm parameters in all 
the approaches were tried. The data set was divided into 
10 folds, where nine of the folds were used for training and 
one for testing. Tenfold cross-validation (10cv) is a renowned 
method to create a "real-world" depiction of a problem from 
the data representing it. 
24 Models were selected based on their 
RMSE values calculated according to Equation 1. The RMSE 
values are a measure of the differences between the predicted 
and the observed values and are completely independent of 
the modeling technique. Hence, they are reliable and widely 
accepted measures for evaluating a model. R statistical envi-
ronment was used to create the models. </p>

<p>CI methods 
Decision trees -<rs type="software">cubist</rs> </p>

<p><rs type="software">Cubist</rs> is a tree-based modeling approach wherein a linear 
model is fit iteratively, resulting in a set of linear models at 
each node starting from the root to the last node of the tree. 
<rs type="software">Cubist</rs> is an ensemble-based technique. All variables that are 
covered by a linear function at a single node are then dis-
carded from the future iterations for that particular tree. This 
process is recursively continued until all the input variables 
have been covered by a single or a set of rules in a tree. This 
is also known as the separate-and-conquer approach. At every 
step, the response of the model is analyzed and adjusted to 
be used by the next model, until the final model is achieved. 
The final prediction is a simple average of the predictions 
from each tree in the ensemble. </p>

<p>Random forests are well known tree-based models. One 
model is shaped by numerous trees in the collection. Indepen-
dent trees are generated based on sample data randomly taken 
out of the training data set. Errors exhibited by individual 
trees are collectively representative of the generalization 
error of the <rs type="software">randomForest</rs> model. 
26 An extensive search for 
the best architecture was carried out using a 10cv scheme, 
followed by training of the best-performing architecture on 
the full data set. </p>

<p>anns -<rs type="software">monmlp</rs> </p>

<p><rs type="software">Monmlp</rs> is the implementation of ANN in <rs type="software">R</rs>. ANNs with 
<rs type="software">monmlp</rs> are generalized feed-forward ANNs that work in a 
monotone fashion using the backpropagation (BP) algorithm </p>

<p>enhanced by the nonlinear minimization algorithm (nlm) for 
training. Neural networks imitate the structure of the human 
brain, whereby information is passed on between neurons 
in the form of synapses. <rs type="software">Monmlp</rs> allows two hidden layers 
of neurons, with hyperbolic tangent and linear activation as 
transfer functions. 
27 In <rs type="software">monmlp</rs>, signals move forward from 
the input layer through sigmoid neurons before reaching the 
linear output layer. 
Neurons in each layer consist of N inputs (X i ), which 
multiplies by the proper generated weight element (W i,j ) for 
the layer named j. Summation of the weighted inputs plus bias 
(b j ) produces the input (n j ) for the activation function, using 
which the output of each neuron (y i ) can be calculated. 
Moreover, different activation functions, such as hyper-
bolic tangent sigmoid (TAN-SIG) transfer function, loga-
rithm sigmoid (LOGSIG) transfer function, and pure linear 
(PURELIN) transfer function, are the potential transfer 
functions that can be used in each layer. 
28 The neural net-
work package <rs type="software">monmlp</rs> was run extensively to find the best-
performing network architecture with 10cv. The whole data 
set was used to retrain the model on the best architecture. </p>

<p>symbolic regression by <rs type="software">rgp</rs> </p>

<p>Genetic programming (GP) is a bioinspired algorithm based 
on evolution principles to solve complex problems. A com-
plex problem is broken down into smaller, simpler problems 
with random solutions. These solutions are then evolved 
through the biologically mimicked process of variation and 
selection until the end condition is reached or a workable 
solution is generated. Thus, <rs type="software">rgp</rs> is an implementation of GP 
methods in the R environment. 
29 Package <rs type="software">rgp</rs> results are 
simple representations of the problem without being exposed 
to a priori information. <rs type="software">rgp</rs> offers various options for initial-
ization, variation, and selection procedures inherent in GP. 
GP implements a tree structure representation to show the 
mathematical equations. The tree structure is composed of 
two parts: function set (nodes) and a terminal set (leaves). </p>

<p>independent feature selection by <rs type="software">fscaret</rs> </p>

<p>The package <rs type="software">fscaret</rs> allows semiautomatic feature selection, 
working as a wrapper for the caret package in R. <rs type="software">Fscaret</rs> 
is specialized for in silico feature selection experiments, 
whereby approximately 120 different packages are used to 
fit models. 
37 Input feature ranking is extracted from trained 
models by using weighted averages. Sum of squared errors 
(SSE), mean squared errors (MSEs), and RMSEs are used to 
evaluate models. <rs type="software">fscaret</rs> has been successfully implemented 
in recent studies. </p>

<p>model, decision trees, ANNs, and GP algorithms were used. 
<rs type="software">RGP</rs> was performed as an early-stage experiment at this 
point. Nonetheless, <rs type="software">RGP</rs> shows results comparable to those 
from other methods, which is evidence that evolutionary 
computational methods are quite robust and can fit complex 
data well. </p>

<p>the models presented herein are able to extrapolate success-
fully in a small range. Regardless of the complexity in the 
external data set, the <rs type="software">rgp</rs> model represented by Equation 4 
makes accurate predictions of the test cases from all different </p>

<p>Plausible performance of the trained CI models on a signifi-
cantly different external data set could be an occurrence of 
chance. To study this in detail, important features from both 
the data sets were compared. Feature selection experiments 
using fscaret were run independently on the external data set. 
Confirmatory models were developed with a variation of 
input vectors using the tree-based learning method <rs type="software">Cubist</rs>. 
The resulting top features of the external data set are in agree-
ment with the features used to train the models. The results 
confirm that the die compaction force is the most important 
variable, with roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling, </p>

<p>12 We adjust family income to account for the number of adults and children in the household. This 
adjustment is explained below in the fifth section. 
13 Data come from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (<rs type="software">IPUMS</rs>) database (Ruggles et al., 2010). 
The ACS started in 2000, and was only a 0.13 percent sample in that year. For the next four years, it 
was approximately a 0.5 percent sample of the population. The questions used in this study are very 
comparable in the ACS and the 2000 long-form Census. This analysis combines the 2000 ACS with the 
1 percent 2000 Census sample in order to increase the sample size in that year. We also show that our 
main results are robust to dropping the 2000 data. 
14 Specifically, the question asked is: "LAST WEEK, was this person TEMPORARILY absent from a job 
or business?" Respondents can answer "Yes, on vacation, temporary illness, labor dispute, and so forth." 
or "No." The Current Population Survey (CPS) asks about maternity and paternity leave specifically and 
is used to identify the effect of CA-PFL on mothers' leave-taking in Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, and Waldfogel 
(2013). However, the sample of fathers on leave in California in the CPS is too small to produce meaningful 
estimates. </p>

<p>The chi-square test was used to determine whether there 
is a significant difference between two groups in Fig. 2 to 6. 
The p value (&lt;0.01) was used to test statistical significance 
of evidence. The <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs>21(Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">21.0</rs>) was used to analyzed. Overall, 75% of fusion 
rate was seen and 25% of non-fusion rate was seen. In alend-
ronate group, fusion was achieved in 66.7% compared to 
73.9% in control group (no medication) (Fig. 2). There was 
no statistical difference between the two groups (p=0.599). 
Alendronate seems to have no effect on the fusion rate. 
The endplate degeneration was classified by Modic </p>

<p>to male Wistar rats (body weight 150-250 g). The data are taken 
from Table 2 of [28] and are shown as means ± SEM, n = 9. The time 
points from 0.25-8 h were fitted to a one-phase decay model using 
the least squares method (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad</rs> <rs id="software-0" type="software">Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">6.0</rs> h for the Macintosh). 
The model returns the extrapolated plasma concentration at t = 0 
(C p(o) , 913 ± 16 nM), the value to which the curve asymptotes 
(44 ± 1 nM, i.e. the data ≥2 h), the rate constant (3.4 ± 0.06 h 
À1 ) </p>

<p>All relevant data were recorded by the pharmacist in an 
internal database, using IBM <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> for Windows <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">20.0</rs>. 
Patient data were documented by assigning an individual 
patient number, case number, gender, age and date of 
observation. In order to enable the evaluation, the initially 
documented ADRs were coded numerically according to 
the system organ classes (SOCs) of the MedDRA (Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology, and the 
specific symptom. Also, corresponding causality categories 
were entered numerically. For every documented ADR and 
week, a single data set containing patient details, medica-
tion, daily dosage and causality category for every given 
AED was generated. Where the same ADR was docu-
mented more than once for one patient, the first docu-
mented observation and accordingly the one with the 
lowest AED dosages was included for analysis only. For 
patients without ADRs, the highest AED dosage was 
considered. To rule out possible input errors, the data were 
entered twice at different times. Asserted discrepancies 
were clarified by re-checking the record forms. </p>

<p>with diabetes were included as were par-
ticipants with undiagnosed diabetes (fast-
ing glucose Ն126 mg/dl or GHb Ն6.5%) 
(10). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations 
were measured using a radioimmunoas-
say procedure. Serum PTH concentra-
tions were measured on the Elecsys 1010 
analyzer using an electrochemiluminescent 
procedure. The quintiles of 25(OH)D and 
PTH were created after taking into account 
the sampling weights. 
Plasma concentrations of fasting and 
2-h glucose, fasting insulin, and GHb 
were adjusted for differences in labora-
tory methodology between NHANES 
2003-2004 and 2005-2006. Oral glu-
cose tolerance test data were available 
only for NHANES 2005-2006. We de-
fined fasting hyperglycemia as a fasting 
glucose Ն100 mg/dl, 2-h hyperglycemia 
as a 2-h glucose Ն140 mg/dl, and high 
GHb as a value of Ն6.0%. HOMA-IR in-
dex was calculated as (fasting plasma in-
sulin [mU/l] ϫ fasting plasma glucose 
[mmol/l])/22.5. Hyperinsulinemia and 
high HOMA-IR were defined using the 
weighted 75th percentiles. 
Covariates in our analyses included 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smok-
ing, physical activity, alcohol drinking, 
BMI, abdominal obesity, and serum cal-
cium concentrations. From 3,551 partic-
ipants without physician-diagnosed 
diabetes, 3,206 (1,582 male subjects and 
1,624 female subjects) remained in our 
analyses after excluding those who had 
missing values for study variables. The 
prevalence of surrogate markers of IR was 
age-standardized to the 2000 U.S. popu-
lation. Linear trends across quintiles of 
25(OH)D and PTH were tested using or-
thogonal contrasts in <rs type="software">SUDAAN</rs> software. 
Multiple logistic regression analyses were 
conducted to test associations of 25(OH)D 
or PTH with markers of IR. </p>

<p>A standardized physical therapy protocol was initiated for each 
group on postoperative day 1. The physical therapy regimen con-
sisted of 2 hours of continuous passive motion machine twice daily, 
assisted standing, and assisted walking. All patients were dis-
charged when deemed medically stable, their pain was under 
control, and the physical therapy goals were met. 
Standard statistical Student's t tests were used to evaluate the 
mean outcome of continuous variables between groups, and chi-
square tests were used to evaluate categorical variables. Dedi-
cated statistical software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">22</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL) was used 
to perform the data analysis. The two groups were compared on the 
basis of length of hospital stay; amount of narcotic pain medication 
used over the first 24, 48, and 72 hours; and the distance walked on 
postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Statistically significant difference 
was considered at P .05 between groups. </p>

investigated using Mann-Whitney U test. The relation 
between categorical variables was tested either by the chi-
square test or by the Fisher's exact test. A linear regression 
analysis was performed to estimate the relation between the 
cost and duration of a hospitalization. The level of statisti-
cal significance was determined as 0.05. Analyses were 
performed using the MedCalc statistical software program

<p>Because the measure is very noisy in terms of its year-on-year fluctuations, we 
focus attention on the average number of convictions, for the period 1976-2002. 
We use this sample of years to keep comparability with the existing literature (e.g., 
Glaeser and Saks 2006, Alt and Lassen 2008). 
The baseline measure aggregates state-, federal-, and local-level officials, plus 
"others involved." This adds noise to the extent that the accountability logic we 
focus on pertains most directly to state governments. However, it adds much rel-
evant information, both because state officials are only a fraction of those implicated 
in corruption at the level of state politics, and because one would expect that a cul-
ture of corruption arising at that level would spill over to other domains of govern-
ment in the state. 
6 Still, we consider as an alternative approach a measure restricted 
to state-level officials. These are not discriminated on a state-by-state basis in the 
PIS Report, but some of the information can be recovered from the Transactional 
Records Access Clearinghouse (TRACfed) at Syracuse University, a database com-
piling information about the federal government. We have gathered yearly data for 
each individual state and (fiscal) year between 1986 and 2011, and averaged them 
over the entire available period. 
7 We also normalize the measure, using the number 
of state government employees (as of 1980). 
For the sake of robustness, we will also look at different approaches to measur-
ing corruption. First, we follow Saiz and Simonsohn (2013) in building a measure 
from an online search, using the <rs type="software">Exalead</rs> tool, for the term "corruption" close to 
the name of each state (performed in 2009). 
8 Lastly, we consider additionally (in 
the online Appendix) the measure of corruption perceptions in state politics intro-
duced by Boylan and Long (2003), based on a set of questions posed to report-
ers covering State Houses, and the TRACFed-based measure of convictions of 
local officials. The former is less objective, but gives us another measure of state-
level corruption; the latter provides a measure of spillovers across different levels 
of government. </p>

<p>5 Still, there obviously is variation related to the functioning of local District Attorney (DA) offices and federal 
agencies, introducing measurement error in the variable (Alt and Lassen forthcoming, Gordon 2009). 
6 As an illustration of the former, consider the case involving former Alabama governor Don Siegelman, who was 
convicted of corruption charges in 2006. As can be gleaned from the 2006 PIS Report, four people were convicted 
in addition to the governor, in relation to the same episode, and none of them were state officials. 
7 This restricted measure is much noisier, not the least because, since there are relatively few state-level officials 
compared to other levels, their share in aggregate convictions is relatively small-typically about 10 percent overall, 
as compiled in the PIS Report. The average number of convictions per state-year in the overall measure is about 14, 
whereas the number for the restricted measure constructed from TRACfed is just under one. 
8 The choice of <rs type="software">Exalead</rs> is due to its being one of the few engines offering reliable "proximity" searches (Saiz 
and Simonsohn 2013, p.138). They argue that this measure performs well in reproducing the standard stylized facts 
found by the literature on corruption, both at the state and country levels. 
9 These measures are typically significantly correlated with one another (see the online Appendix). In particular, 
the baseline measure of federal convictions is highly correlated with the measure restricted to state officials (just 
under 0.6), and somewhat less so with the measure restricted to local officials (about 0.4). The two restricted mea-
sures are significantly correlated with each other (0.33), consistent with the existence of spillovers. The <rs type="software">Exalead</rs> 
measure has a more tenuous correlation with the baseline (0.25, significant at the 10 percent level). </p>

<p>We then look at the alternative <rs type="software">Exalead</rs> measure of corruption. 
23 Columns 3 and 
4 again mimic the main baseline specifications, and again find very similar results. 
The estimated quantitative effect is now of about 0.7 standard deviation, once again 
very close to the baseline. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS-These data suggest that although Hp geno-
type is not associated with albuminuria per se, it may be an 
independent determinant of early renal function decline and 
progression to ESRD. Understanding these apparent contradic-
tory findings may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of 
renal disease in type 1 diabetes. Diabetes Urinary albumin was measured by immunonephelometry (23), and creati-
nine was assayed by an Ectachem 400 Analyzer (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, 
NY). Microalbuminuria was defined as albumin excretion rate (AER) of 
20 -200 g/min (30 -300 mg per 24 h) and macroalbuminuria as AER Ͼ200 
g/min (Ͼ300 mg per 24 h) in at least 2 of 3 validated timed urine collections. 
In 10% of the samples, urine collections were deemed inadequate based on 
creatinine excretion and albumin-to-creatinine ratio was used (microalbumin-
uria, 0.03-0.3 mg/mg; macroalbuminuria, Ͼ0.3 mg/mg) (24). ESRD onset was 
defined as starting dialysis or undergoing renal transplantation. Early renal 
function decline was defined as the incidence of a decline of Ն30 ml/min per 
1.73 m 
2 from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the 
Cockcroft-Gault equation (25) among participants with normal or mildly 
reduced renal function at study entry (stages I and II). 
High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated using the PureGene kit 
(Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and Hp was genotyped by an amplifica-
tion method (26). Genotypes were assigned visually by comparison with 
controls of known genotype and in a random sample showed excellent 
agreement (97%) with an Eliza method (27). 
Statistical analysis. Nonnormally distributed variables were logarithmically 
transformed. Univariate associations were determined using the Student t test 
and 
2 or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Cox proportional hazards models 
with backward elimination were constructed to assess the multivariable 
association between Hp genotype and the incidence of each outcome of 
interest adjusting for traditional risk factors (including eGFR and AER levels 
at study entry) and univariately significant variables. Survival time was 
defined as the time in years from study entry to either an incident event or 
censorship during the 18-year follow-up. Statistical analyses were conducted 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.1</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC). </p>

measurement data were shown as mean ± standard deviation, 
the mean value of the two samples was compared by t-test, 
and the rate was compared by χ 
2 test. Spearman correlation 
analysis was used to compare the correlation between the 
severity of fatty liver and the HOMA-IR index. All statistical 
tests were two sided and evaluated at the 0.05 alpha level. </p>

conducted if a significant difference was found. A paired t-test was 
conducted to compare area under curve (calculate by a trapezoidal 
method) between exercises. Statistical significance was set at P&lt;

<p>examples occur in many cellular pathways and it might be 
necessary in mammalian cells to pool RNAi reagents for mul-
tiple candidates to generate a loss-of-function phenotype. 
While this is technically possible, it will significantly increase 
the complexity of screens. 
More than 20 genome-wide (or genome-scale) screens in 
Drosophila cells have been published since 2003 and a key 
challenge remains to integrate and compare different datasets. 
Since many screens have been performed using different 
RNAi libraries and readouts, a proper annotation using 
minimal information for RNAi experiments would be req-
uired. The equivalent of a MIAME convention is currently 
lacking and the breadth and quality of data provided for 
screens varies. Data structures and databases will be needed 
to cross-correlate phenotypic information. 
As large-scale studies remain largely untested in follow-up 
experiments for a certain period of time, it is crucial to 
systematically integrate phenotypes and annotation informa-
tion to estimate false positive and false negative rates. A com-
parison across multiple screens can also be used to evaluate 
the reliability of a phenotype or a particular RNAi reagent 
used in these studies. Ultimately, phenotypic profiles of 
many screens can serve to cluster unknown genes and provide 
guideposts for follow-up analysis (12). Since most cell-based 
RNAi screens have been published using Drosophila RNAi 
libraries, these screens can serve as a model for the organi-
zation of data produced in large-scale RNAi experiments. 
Here we describe a publicly accessible database to inte-
grate annotation of RNAi reagents and functional information 
obtained from large-scale RNAi experiments. The database 
allows the user to access phenotype data from published 
screens and the sequences of their underlying perturbation 
reagents. Specificity and other sequence features are display-
ed in the context of the genomic location of the targeted 
gene model. <rs type="software">GenomeRNAi</rs> also facilitates the design of 
new experiments, using previously designed RNAi reagents 
from independent libraries and links to a design program of 
RNAi constructs for independent retests (13). The database 
structure is flexible and allows adding large-scale cell-based 
phenotypic datasets from other organisms once they become 
available. </p>

<p>The database integrates the sequence information of the 
RNAi reagents with phenotypic information based on 
genome-scale and genome-wide published RNAi screens. It 
contains 90 998 RNAi probes that have been designed by 
various groups. These include libraries used in Heidelberg 
and Boston (4,14), by groups in San Francisco and others 
(15). Using the sequence information, all RNAi constructs 
were computationally mapped onto the latest genomic 
sequence using <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> and <rs type="software">MUMmer</rs> (16,17) and gene 
and isoform annotations were derived through the mapping 
process. All probe information is visualized using an imple-
mentation of the <rs type="software">Generic Genome Browser</rs> (<rs type="software">GBrowse</rs>) 
(18). Additional information was added to describe the 
specificity of dsRNAs. To this end, we have generated all 
possible 19mer sequences of annotated gene models (in 
total &gt;40 Mio.) and identified homologous sequences in the </p>

<p>complete genome. These are annotated as 'tracks' in 
<rs type="software">GBrowse</rs> and allow evaluation of the specificity of RNAi 
probe sequences. In addition, <rs type="software">GBrowse</rs> tracks are included 
that show other types of non-specific regions, such as low 
complexity and repetitive elements in the gene model 
which should be avoided in the design of RNAi probes. Phe-
notypes mapping to such elements should also be treated with 
caution until further confirmatory data is available. Further-
more, for every single 19mer sequence we have calculated 
an RNAi efficiency score (19) which is shown as a 'RNAi 
efficiency' column in the database. The average predicted 
efficiency is shown for individual RNAi probes from various 
libraries as well as a 'track' for complete gene models in the 
<rs type="software">GBrowse</rs> interface. Specificity and efficiency information can 
also be used to guide the design of new RNAi probes for 
follow-up experiments. 
RNAi phenotypes of large-scale screens from our own lab 
and all to-date published screens were curated from the 
author's websites or the Supplementary Data. To date, the 
database contains 24 genome-scale screens which were 
performed with different genome-wide and subset RNAi 
libraries. A total of 5436 phenotypes are currently stored in 
<rs type="software">GenomeRNAi</rs>, which will be expanded as more data becomes 
available. Phenotype frequency varies among the screens 
from 23 to &gt;1000 hits per screen. A list of all currently avail-
able screens can be accessed at http://www.dkfz.de/signaling/ 
screens/. </p>

<p>The database can be accessed through various routes. Indivi-
dual gene entries can be directly accessed via a linkout 
('Heidelberg RNAi') from <rs type="software">Flybase</rs> (20). From the entry web-
page of the database, user can search by gene identifier, by 
RNAi probe ID (if known) or by phenotype (Figure 1). For 
all these search options more detailed web pages are available 
which offer advanced input options (e.g. sequence homology 
search). Through the 'phenotype' entry page a complete list 
of all phenotypes can be requested by clicking the 'Display 
list of all phenotypes' link. This can then be used to access 
an individual gene or probe list. A second way to search 
for phenotypes and RNAi probe information is by sequence 
similarity. In the 'Gene' or 'Probe' menu page, the user can 
enter a Drosophila (or heterologous) nucleotide or protein 
sequence which is mapped by using <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> against the 
BDGP transcript file or probe files. This allows for example 
to search for phenotypes of a homolog of human cdc2 or can 
be used to find all RNAi probes from various libraries that 
overlap with a query sequence. </p>

<p>transcripts are targeted (column 'Other Targets') by the 
dsRNA. The database allows then to drill down and retrieve 
more detailed information, including primer and amplicon 
sequences (Figure 2B) by following the 'RNAi probe' link 
as well as more detailed information on other targets by fol-
lowing the corresponding link. The completeness of available 
RNAi constructs in their genomic context is summarized in 
an interactive <rs type="software">GBrowse</rs> implementation, which shows the 
gene model, the RNAi probes of all available libraries and 
tracks that allow evaluating the efficiency and specificity of 
probe sequences (Figure 2C). Other <rs type="software">GBrowse</rs> functions can 
then be used to extract for example non-targeted regions, com-
mon exons, regions with high specificity or regions of low-
complexity. Information can be extracted as text or XML files. 
An example of a database session is shown in Figure 2. In 
this case, the user searched for RNAi probes that target 
CG6210 (FBgn0036141), a factor required for the secretion 
of Wg/Wnt ligands (3). Figure 2A shows that multiple 
RNAi probes are available in different libraries and also 
links to <rs type="software">FlyBase</rs>, if more information on CG6210 is reques-
ted. When the user selects the HFA10605 RNAi probe, the 
database shows more detailed information, such as primer

tion, the length and sequence of the amplicon. This page

<p>the RNAi experiment. When selecting the <rs type="software">GBrowse</rs> image, 
the user can locate other RNAi probes in relation to the 
gene model; for example, whereas for CG6210 six dsRNAs 
from different libraries have a similar location, a single 
dsRNA ('AMC-Amplicon') targets only one splice variant 
(CG6210-RA) and might give only a partial phenotype. 
These assignments are even more complex for gene models 
that have a larger number of splice variants and/or overlap-
ping transcripts. 
The database can also be accessed through searching for 
phenotypes or selecting from an all phenotypes list which 
can be retrieved from phenotype search menu. 
Through these pages, the database provides gene annota-
tion by comparing phenotypes in the light of the sequence 
content of probes targeting the gene of interest. Furthermore, 
individual gene models are linked to external databases such 
as <rs type="software">FlyBase</rs> and <rs type="software">FLIGHT</rs> for other functional information. A 
link to <rs type="software">E-RNAi</rs> (13) is provided to allow a direct redesign of 
independent RNAi probes. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">GenomeRNAi</rs> database presents phenotype information 
of large-scale screens in the context of associated sequence 
information. We believe that this is an important issue </p>

The <rs type="software">GenomeRNAi</rs> database is linked to other databases, 
such as <rs type="software">FLIGHT</rs> and <rs type="software">FlyRNAi</rs> (24,25). While all these data-
bases contain RNAi phenotype information, the focus of 
<rs type="software">GenomeRNAi</rs> is to present phenotypes in the context of 
genomic information, which should facilitate the analysis 
of RNAi phenotypes with respect to gene models and speci-
ficity information. <rs type="software">GenomeRNAi</rs> has an integrated pipeline 
for mapping of RNAi probes and phenotypes and integrating 
the information of different RNAi libraries, but the focus is 
less on the integration of different genomic datasets as 
provided by <rs type="software">FLIGHT</rs>. 
A major issue in representing RNAi phenotypes remains a 
lack of standards on minimal information which need to be 
provided for small and large-scale screening approaches, as 
well as an ontology to properly describe cellular phenotypes. 
With time we expect that the community will develop such 
standards which will become a prerequisite for publication. 
The same holds true for the analysis of numerical data asso-
ciated with phenotypic information, which can be analyzed in 
different ways and which may lead to different 'phenotype 
lists' depending on the arbitrary threshold that is being used 
as a cut-off. Compendia that include both primary data and 
the analysis route could alleviate analysis diversity and 
enable the re-analysis of datasets when new algorithms will 
be available or datasets will be cross-correlated (26,27). 
In the future, we plan to add cell-based phenotypes from 
other species, such as human, including sequence information 
which is currently largely not available due to proprietary restric-
tions. Cross-specific comparisons should provide a useful means 
to extract functional and highly confirmed phenotypes. </p>

mRNA expression was confirmed via reverse transcription PCR after 2 h of DA-9801 treatment. Also, we measured (C) NGF levels in the 
sciatic nerves and (D) the plasma of DA-9801-treated db/db mice. To investigate the NGF-mimetic activity of DA-9801, we treated PC12 
cells with 125 μg/ml of DA-9801. The neurite outgrowth per cell was observed every other day, and (E) images were taken of randomly se-

<p>The second stage of research occurs in Introduction to Econometrics, usually taken in the junior year. 
This course convenes in our econometrics lab, which has 28 computers. Enrollments are capped at 22 
students per section due to the heavy burden that draft editing imposes on the professor. The course 
covers standard econometric topics: estimation using OLS, hypothesis testing, serial correlation and 
time series, as well as introduction to more advanced topics such as panel data, instrumental variables, 
and logit/probit estimation. Data analysis is conducted with <rs type="software">STATA</rs>, which students begin using the sec-
ond week of class, and the instruction tends to be applied rather than mathematical/algebraic. A required 
one-hour lab was added 25 years ago to provide extra instruction time to cover research methods. The 
course also receives extensive support from our library staff who have developed instruction modules 
and resource guides to assist students with their research. </p>

<p>In addition to the curricular structure discussed above, we attempt to promote student research by allo-
cating resources in particular ways and structuring incentives to raise the return to research activity. 
We seek to hire faculty who are passionate about research and view themselves as both teachers and 
scholars. We find that those who do applied research are better able to involve students in their research, 
and we attempt to identify people who enjoy working collaboratively. Faculty are also incentivized to 
publish papers with students. For instance, they are asked to highlight Macalester student co-authors on 
their CV, and this type of collaboration is valued by the committee that makes tenure and promotion 
decisions. 
Faculty-student research is funded internally three different ways. First, faculty receive $1,750 each 
year for travel and research. Second, they can compete for Wallace Scholarly Activities grants that are 
often used to hire research assistants. Finally, Student-Faculty Collaboration &amp; Summer Research grants 
can also be obtained rather easily and, as the name suggests, promote co-authorship. 
A number of articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals by Macalester faculty and stu-
dents. For example, in 1998, Professor Gary Krueger and Marek Ciolko published, "A Note on Initial 
Conditions and Liberalization during Transition" in the Journal of Comparative Economics. Professor 
Liang Ding has written four articles with students, and in 2012 he and Macalester mathematics professor 
Vittorio Addona worked with Hao Zou, who is currently completing his PhD in finance at the Univer-
sity of Rochester, and published "Semi-Transparency, Dealership Market and Foreign Exchange Market 
Quality" in the Review of Financial Economics. Professor Amy Damon has published two papers with 
students, and she and Devon Kristiansen wrote "Childhood Obesity in Mexico: The Effect of Interna-
tional Migration, " which appeared in Agricultural Economics in 2014. Sarah West has written papers with 
several students, and in 2014 she and Needham Hurst published "Public Transit and Urban Redevelop-
ment: The Effect of Light Rail Transit on Land Use in Minneapolis, Minnesota" in Regional Science and 
Urban Economics. 
We look for ways to increase the efficiency of classroom teaching in order to free up time for research 
and one-on-one work with students. This includes reducing the overall number of course preps, teaching 
back-to-back sections of the same course in a given semester, and hiring student preceptors to grade 
problem sets and tutor peers. Our proximity to the University of Minnesota makes it relatively easy for 
us to hire part-time replacements and thus encourage sabbatical extensions. 
We are fortunate to have facilities that support student research. About three decades ago, the depart-
ment received an NSF grant to build a computer lab, and the college continues to invest in this space with 
new hardware (28 Macs) and software (<rs type="software">STATA</rs>). Our introductory and advanced econometrics courses 
benefit a great deal from the lab, and it is a hub for research activity throughout the year. The walls of 
the lab are covered with plaques that commemorate research-paper prizes our students have won, and 
we hope that they inspire the younger students. 
Throughout the year, each honors thesis writer has their picture and thesis title prominently displayed 
in the hallway leading to the economics department office. To further shine a spotlight on thesis writers 
and hopefully inspire younger students to follow in their footsteps, economics classes are canceled on a 
Friday in April and all honors defenses occur on that day. Extra credit and food are used to incentivize 
students to attend presentations, and parents and grandparents have been known to show up on occasion. 
Each year, we hold a ceremony to honor our seniors in late April. Those who have completed an honors 
thesis are given the podium for a few minutes to summarize their research. In addition, departmental 
awards with cash prizes are announced. These awards provide another incentive for students to invest 
time into research because they are based, in part, on course performance and term paper grades. </p>

<p>for a given field to that in the reference field with the same collimator opening (C0) to eliminate the collimator effect 
(4). Therefore, the formula in Figure 1, Eq.5. In this study, to maintain the collimator opening for all fields, the 
phantom surface can be pulled up (for L&lt;L0) or down (for L&gt;L0) (Figure 2). For example, for a field smaller than L0, 
L=AB, it is necessary to pull up phantom surface to J=(L/L0) ×SSD to achieve the same collimator opening. However, 
care must be which the dosimeter reading at J' needs to be corrected for SSD changes using Mayneord Factor. 
Therefore; we have to perform dosimetry in several SSDs and the main problem is phantom surface collision with 
Linac head for small fields. On the other hand, according to Eq. 3 and 5, the difference between the Sp and the total 
scatter factor is the amount of the collimator opening. Therefore, by considering a correction factor (for the effect of 
collimator) in the total scatter factor (Eq. 4), Sp can be achieved (Eq.5) as Figure 1, Eq.6. In Figure 2 with regards to 
the Pythagorean theorem, the trapezoid ABC"D" and A'B'C'D' are equal; therefore, the Sp is obtained by dividing the 
dosimeter readings at S' form two volume VA'B'C"D" and reference volume VEFGH. In this method, we propose to apply 
a factor (α) to correct scatter portion reached to the dosimeter (S') from VABCD to VABC"D". As mentioned in previous 
studies (15, 16), suppose that there is a parallel beam striking the surface of the phantom and consider a reference 
plane normal to the central axis, placed at depth d=10cm which the origin is on the central axis. Hence, each element 
(dx.dy) on this plane acts as a source of scattered radiation. The amount of scatter radiation reaching the central axis 
(dosimeter location, S') is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between surface elements and the origin. 
Therefore, with taking into account the photon attenuation µ, α is defined as Figure 1, Eq.7; Where µ is energy 
attenuation coefficient which depends on energy, field size and depth (17, 18). Therefore, the formula in Figure 1, 
Eq.8. α will be greater or lesser than 1 while phantom surface was pulled up or down respectively. Let us eliminate 
the small area at the origin of the coordinate with radius ε (refers to the ion chamber radius =3mm) to overcome 
singularity in nominator and denominator in Eq.7 and use polar system (Figure 3). Therefore, the scatter contribution 
to dosimeter location (S') for a rectangular field with dimensions (2Y × 2X) (Figure 3) is calculated as Figure 1, Eq.9. 
Finally, a general computer program using <rs id="software-0" type="software">MATLAB</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">7.12.0</rs> software was written to calculate α using the numerical 
method to solve Eq. 9. </p>

<p>incubated 37 for 48 h. One hour before harvesting i.e., 
after 47 h of incubation, cultures were centrifuged, culture 
volume was adjusted to 2.5 cm 
3 , and Calyculin A (50 nM) 
or Okadaic acid (500 nM) was added to the culture. After 
about 1 h of incubation with the drug, cultures were har-
vested and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 8 min to get a firm 
pellet with a clear supernatant. Supernatant was discarded 
and a pellet was disturbed and mixed thoroughly using a 
vertex. Pre-warmed (37 ) hypotonic solution (0.075 M 
KCl) was added to the pellet with constant vortex mixing. 
The pellets in the hypotonic solution were incubated at 
37 for 6 min in a pre-warmed water bath and then cen-
trifuged at 900 rpm for 8 min. The cells were fixed by 
cold fixative solution with 1: 3 mixtures of acetic acid 
and methanol after removing the supernatant and gentle 
agitation. To prepare the chromosome spread on slides, 
the cells were mixed thoroughly and dropped on a pre-
cleaned frozen slide from a certain height (~30 cm) fol-
lowed by quick warm and air blow on the slide surface to 
get better spread of metaphase chromosomes. The slides 
were stained using giemsa stain for 10 to 12 min by dip-
ping in staining solution and washing 3 to 4 times with a 
d.d.w. The slides were mounted with a cover slip using 
Deepex before scoring. PCC spreads were analyzed at 
100X magnification with an Olympus BX 51 fluorescent 
microscope coupled to a Jenoptik C5 cooled CCD camera 
with <rs id="software-0" type="software">ProgRes Capture Pro</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">2.8</rs> software. 100rings per dose

gested by Kanda et al.

shaped PCC rings, and another suggested by Lamadrid et 
al.

clearly defined open space. Extra fragments were re-
corded as those exceeding 46 pieces in G2/M PCC cells 
and 92 pieces in case of M/A PCC cells. For each ring, 
one fragment was not considered as extra fragment. For 
curve fitting, the minimum Chi-square method using Ori-
gin package was used. The distribution of PCC rings were 
analyzed by Papworth's u test

Artificial neural network and LR models were computed using the 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">MATLAB</rs>-software and the <rs type="software">Neural Network Toolbox</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Mathworks</rs>, 
Natick, MA, USA). Each ANN (feed forward network with error back 
propagation) had three layers: input layer with four neurons, hidden 
layer with two neurons and output layer with one neuron representing 
the nonBCR probability. Follow-up data after LRP were collected every 
6 months and respectively added into the separate models. Every 
6 months separate models (ANN and LR) were calculated with those 
patients still not having a BCR at this time-point (those with a BCR 
earlier were excluded) and those who were not censored. For all models, 
internal validation was performed with the leave one out method.

to compare all variables using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analyses regarding sensitivity, specificity and areas under ROC curve

<p>Apoptosis was detected by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl-
transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) using 
the fluorescein-dUTP-in situ cell death detection kit (Roche 
Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). For TUNEL assay, cells 
were seeded on microscope cover glasses pre-coated with 0.1% 
poly-D-lysine [prepared in 100 mM Na 2 B 4 O 7 .10(H 2 O) buffer 
at pH 8.2], and cultured over-night in the HG-medium. After 
confirming attachment of cells to the cover slips, medium was 
changed to LG-medium for over-night starvation. Glucose was 
added to the starved cells at different concentrations and for 
different time periods, after which TUNEL was performed accord-
ing to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and then washed in PBS. Cells were 
permeabilized in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% 
sodium citrate on ice, washed twice with PBS and incubated with 
TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 • C in a humidified 
atmosphere in the dark. Slides were washed twice with PBS, stained 
with DAPI for nuclei detection, and washed again with PBS. The 
cover glasses with cells were flapped on glass slides covered with a 
few drops of mounting media (DakoCytomation), photographed 
using an upright fluorescence microscope (Axioscop 2, ZEISS), 
and processed by the <rs type="software">Image Pro</rs> software. </p>

<p>Apoptosis was also detected by PARP cleavage from 116 kDa into 
89 kDa fragments using western blot analysis. Since PARP is a 
nuclear protein, we decided to test its cleavage in nuclear extracts 
and not in whole-cell extracts to prevent dilution. Nuclear extracts 
were prepared and collected as described previously (Schreiber 
et al., 1989). Proteins were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. 
Membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 
1 h, and subsequently probed with a primary monoclonal anti-
body: anti-PARP (SeroTec, UK) that detects the full length as 
well as the cleaved PARP. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-mouse 
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used 
as secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using 
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent-ECL (prepared locally) and 
visualized by autoradiography. AChE expression was also detected 
using western blot analysis. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 
(Schreiber et al., 1989), and separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as 
described above. A rabbit anti-human polyclonal AChE antibody, 
which detects all isoforms of AChE, was used (sc-11409, diluted 
1:500 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA). A mouse 
monoclonal antibody anti-α-Tubulin (T6199, diluted 1:4000 
from Sigma-aldrich, USA) was used for normalizing cytoplas-
mic protein loading. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-rabbit or anti 
mouse (1:5000 diluted in 50% glycerol, Jackson ImmunoResearch 
Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used as secondary antibody.

<p>Transcripts and notes of interviews were analysed with the

for qualitative data. The semi-structured interview sched-
ule was employed flexibly and was also grounded in that it 
was adapted as the study progressed. A preliminary analy-
sis on the first 12 patient interviews was undertaken by the 
first author (G.D.-W.), who also conducted the interviews. 
Subsequently, the conceptual framework was expanded in 
discussion with all the authors of this article. Although the 
original aim was to describe patient experiences relating to 
investigation and management of their ataxia, it rapidly 
became evident as the baseline interviews progressed that 
most people's contact with health services ended when 
diagnostic investigations were completed, whether or not 
an underlying aetiology was found. Accordingly, diagnosis 
became a focus in the interviews and in the analysis. This 
article focuses especially on the follow-up data as these 
experiences are likely to better reflect the current situation 
for users in services, as opposed to their own historical 
experiences of health services, which in some cases 
stretched back several decades. In the results to follow, 
interview extracts are labelled using two or three fields 
showing the participant ID, quotation number and (in base-
line interviews only) line numbers from the interview 
transcript (e.g. P14: 6: 74-78 or P37: 12). </p>

arc. The right legend specifies the evolutionary support (e.g., covariation, etc.) for each position in the align-
ment. The alignment and arcs at the top show the information for the terminator structure, whereas the bottom 
ones correspond to the anti-terminator structure for the same underlying alignment. The lines in each align-
ment correspond to the respective sequences with every box representing either a nucleotide or a gap in the 
respective sequence. Every arc represents a base-pair involving the respective two alignment columns. The 
arcs are colour-coded according to their percentage of canonical base pairs, whereas the evolutionary informa-
tion supporting each base pair is encoded in the colouring of the underlying nucleotides in the base paired 
alignment columns, see the right legend for details. Two green blocks connected by an arc implies that this is a 
canonical base pair (i.e., GC, AU or GU) which corresponds to the most abundant type of base pair for this pair 
of alignment columns. Cyan means this is a canonical base pair but that it has an one-sided mutation with 
respect to the most abundant (green) base-pair. Blue refers to a canonical base-pair which differs on both sides 
from the most abundant (green) base-pair. Red means this is a non-canonical base pair. Unpaired nucleotides 
are shown in black and gaps in grey. </p>

<p>Alignments 
We summarize the key fea-
tures of our alignments in 
Tables 1 and 2. A small multi-
ple sequence alignment (MSA) 
from a previous project pub-
lished by us 
14 was used to build 
a primary covariance model 
(CM) using the <rs type="software">INFERNAL</rs> pro-
gram 
92 to search the full align-
ments in RFAM 
1 and the NCBI 
TAXONOMY BROWSER. 
93 In our 
previous research, 
14 these small 
MSA were compiled using evolution-
arily related sequences for these four 
RNA families, respectively. These small 
MSAs are of a high-quality with posi-
tive covariation and few gaps, making 
them convenient starting points to 
build the corresponding primary CMs. 
For each of our four alignments, we 
aligned the sequences of the seed align-
ment in RFAM with the primary CM 
first and then curated this against all 
experimentally verified structures which 
were first mapped to a reference 
sequence. We then build a secondary 
CM incorporating sequences from the 
RFAM seed alignment which we used to 
align the hits returned by the search </p>

<p>with the primary CM. These hits were 
clustered to reduce primary sequence 
redundancy, choosing a representative 
sequence for each cluster based on 
structural fit and covariation. Hits pass-
ing this selection strategy were retained 
only if they contained all alternative 
structures. We then calculated quality 
measures for the resulting hits to deter-
mine which ones to add to the existing 
small MSA. The resulting alignment 
was then curated recursively according 
to the aligning results returned by 
<rs type="software">INFERNAL</rs> using the secondary CM for 
each of the alternative structures. </p>

<p>Primary covariation model: Initial 
Small Alignment 
A primary covariation model (cm) is 
constructed using a small good-quality 
alignment assembled previously by our 
group; 
14 repeat the CM compilation (i.e., 
build and calibrate in <rs id="software-17" type="software">INFERNAL</rs>-<rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-number">1.1rc2</rs>) 
for each of the alternative structures. If the 
structure contains pseudo-knots, it must 
be split into non-pseudo-knotted sub-
structures in order to process it in INFER-
NAL; if possible, compatible helices of such 
non-pseudo-knotted substructures and the 
remaining alternative structures are com-
bined into one structure so as to simplify 
the subsequent curation (e.g., in HDV, a 
non-pseudo-knotted substructure of the 
active conformation is added to the alt2 
structure). The aforementioned pre-
assembled alignments of Trp operon 
leader, Levivirus, HDV and SAM ribos-
witch have 10, 7, 10 and 15 sequences, 
respectively. </p>

<p>Secondary covariation model: pre-
assembled alignment + unique RFAM seed 
alignment sequences 
Firstly, the primary CM is used to align 
the sequences from the RFAM seed align-
ment (or only part of it, e.g., the alterna-
tive structures of HDV are only valid for 
the genomic sequences, so only genomic 
sequences are aligned here). This aligning 
procedure is repeated for the primary CM 
built from each of the alternative struc-
tures. Secondly, redundant sequences are 
removed from this expanded alignment 
(i.e., sequence from pre-assembled align-
ment + RFAM seed alignment), which is 
subsequently manually curated to opti-
mise the covariation for all alternative 
structures. Curation is initiated on the 
alignment generated by the CM with the 
structure with the largest number of base 
pairs, and the other alternative structural 
features are mapped onto the same align-
ment. During curation, <rs type="software">RALEE</rs> 
94 is used to 
visually compare the resultant alignments 
generated by the covariation models per-
taining to each alternative structure, and </p>

to add into the original 
small MSA 
Overlapped hits 
Firstly, the primary CM for each alter-
native structure is used to search the RFAM 
full alignment via <rs type="software">INFERNAL</rs> (alternatively, 
for Levivirus, NCBI TAXONOMY BROWSER 
is used by downloading the branch of the 
tree of life in which this non-coding RNA 
resides; for SAM riboswitch, we start our 
curation from an alignment provided by 
Winkler et al. (2003) 
11 and the SAM-
bound structure is also annotated by 
them). A sequence is retained only if the 
searches using the CM of each individual 
alternative structure all return this 
sequence as a hit, and if this sequence 
spans the full length of all the CM without 
truncated ends. A hit is defined as a candi-
date sequence that yields log-odds score 
greater than 0 in the search result. Sec-
ondly, the secondary CM is used to align 
the overlapped hits; repeat the aligning 
step for all secondary CM corresponding 
to each of the alternative structures. Since 
the alignment constructing the secondary 
CM is optimised for all alternative struc-
tures, aligning the hits using the secondary 
CM facilitates the following curation 
among all alternative structures. 
The search for homologs to add is only 
conducted on the RFAM full alignment 
rather than searching the NCBI from 
scratch, which is due to the fact that the 
qualified sequence to add must satisfy the 
requirement for all alternative structures. 
Thus, it would be more efficient but with-
out loss of generality to start from the can-
didates fitting well with at least one of the 
alternative structures, i.e., the RFAM full 
alignment. </p>

<p>primary sequence conservation via 
<rs type="software">USEARCH</rs>; 
95 different percentage iden-
tity cutoffs are tested to obtain around 50 
to 100 clusters. For each alternative struc-
ture, a best-fit sequence is chosen for each 
cluster using home-made scripts scoring 
the covariation. Best-fit sequences over-
lapped among all of the structures are 
identified as common hits. These com-
mon hits are then ranked and filtered 
based on the fit of the sequence to a struc-
ture and the extent of insertions relative to 
the reference sequence, which gives rise to 
a MSA for each structure. </p>

<p>history of hip disease in childhood or adolescence and peri-
pheral vascular disease have been excluded. No patient was 
using platelet aggregation inhibitors, coumarin derivate or was 
subjected to heparin prior to surgery. Anesthesia of patients was 
performed with lumbar spinal block, using heavy bupivacaine 
20 mg and 0.1 mg morphine. Patients were placed in contra-
lateral lateral position to perform a posterior-lateral approach. 
After opening the fascia lata and muscle and repair of tendons 
of the external rotator muscles of the hip, articular exposure 
with the opening of the posterior capsule was performed. The 
posterior hip dislocation with maximum flexion and internal ro-
tation exposes the femoral head for visualization of the four 
quadrants (anterior, posterior, superior and inferior). (Figure 1) 
After completion of the exposure of the joint surface, a puncture 
was performed in the middle of each quadrant with a 3.2 mm 
drill with a 10 mm depth lock. The bleeding was observed and 
qualified by registering it as early bleeding (EB: immediate to 
10 seconds), late bleeding (LB: after 10 seconds) or without 
bleeding (WB). (Figure 2) This study was approved by the Ins-
titutional Ethics Committee and the patients signed a Free and 
Informed Consent form. 
Among the variables analyzed, gender, age, laterality, body 
mass index (BMI), degree of osteoarthritis and bleeding 
according to the quadrant of the femoral head were included.

Statistical analysis of primary screen data. To identify compounds 
that inhibited B activity without affecting L. monocytogenes growth, 
opuCA-directed GUS activity in the presence of each compound was cal-
culated by dividing relative fluorescence units (RFU) by cell density in 
OD 600 units (RFU/OD) (61). Statistical analyses were conducted in col-
laboration with the Broad Institute and performed as previously described 
(62, 63). Raw and analyzed data were deposited in ChemBank (64, 65). 
The software package <rs id="software-1" type="software">Spotfire DecisionSite Analytics</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">TIBCO Spotfire</rs>, 
Somerville, MA) was used for two-dimensional data visualization. 
Secondary screen and dose response curve. Forty-one compounds 
that appeared to inhibit B activity (Z score of Յ-3 in both replicates) 
were selected for secondary cell-based screening using the assay and re-
porter fusion described above to calculate initial IC 50 s. Each compound 
was diluted in DMSO in a series of six 1/5 dilutions of the initial stock 
concentration [e.g., starting from 19.3 mM stock, (E)-N,2-
diphenylethenesulfonamide was diluted in a series of six 1 to 5 dilutions, 
yielding concentrations of 3.86 mM to 1.24 M]. The small molecules at 
these concentrations were then dispensedinto the assay plates. 
Small-molecule microarray screens. Two different arrays, each 
printed with 8,500 small-molecule (SM) spots and 1,500 DMSO control 
spots, were used to screen for binding of B to the small molecules. Small-
molecule microarrays (SMMs) were printed on glass slides at the Broad 
Institute as described previously (66-68). The immobilized SMs included 
8,500 compounds created by diversity-oriented synthesis and 8,500 com-
pounds representing natural products, FDA-approved drug-like com-
pounds, commercial compounds, and known bioactive compounds (Ta-
ble S1) (68; http://Chembank.broadinstitute.org). SMM screening (three 
replicates) was performed as described by Bradner et al. (66). His-tagged 
B was purified from E. coli M15, kindly provided by W. Goebel (69). Data 
analyses included (i) assessment of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spot 
feature; (ii) Z score calculations based on comparison of signals from 
compound spots to signals from DMSO control spots within a slide; and 
(iii) composite Z score calculations for data from the three replicates. 
Spotfire Analytics software was used for three-dimensional data visualiza-
tion. 
FPSS. (E)-N,2-diphenylethenesulfonamide, the compound identified 
by HTS as being responsible for the greatest inhibition of B activity, was 
not commercially available. Therefore, the analog fluoro-phenyl-styrene-
sulfonamide [IUPAC name (E)-N-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-phenylethenesul-
fonamide; ChemBank ID, 2063822; MW 277.3] was obtained from Enam-
ine Ltd. (Kiev, Ukraine). FPSS was dissolved in DMSO to a concentration 
of 10 mM. The solution was filter sterilized using with a 0.1-m filter 
(Omnipore membrane filter; Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) and a 
Swinney stainless 13-mm holder for syringe filtration (Millipore Corpo-
ration). 
Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity assay. As L. monocytogenes bsh, 
which encodes bile salt hydrolase, is B dependent (5, 7, 15), a qualitative 
BSH activity assay was used to determine the FPSS concentration needed 
for B inhibition. Four-well multidish plates (26 mm by 33 mm; Nunc) 
containing 6 ml of either BHI agar or de Man, Rogosa and Sharp (MRS) 
agar medium (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) containing 0.5% (wt/vol) 
glycodeoxycholic acid sodium (GDCA) salt (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) 
(70) with either no FPSS or 96, 193, or 290 M of FPSS [1.5, 3, or 4.5 times 
the 64.3 M concentration used for (E)-N,2-diphenylethenesulfonamide 
in the HTS] were prepared and allowed to dry overnight. L. monocytogenes 
10403S and ⌬sigB were grown in BHI broth to exponential phase, defined 
as an OD 600 of 0.4, and then 4 l of culture was spotted in parallel on MRS 
and BHI agars. The MRS agar plates were incubated anaerobically using 
the BD-BBL GasPak anaerobic system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, 
NJ), while BHI plates were incubated aerobically. Both sets of plates were 
incubated for 48 h at 37°C and then were visually assessed for growth (BHI 
plates) or the presence of a white precipitate comprised of deconjugated </p>

<p>bile salts indicating BSH activity (MRS plates). The assay was performed 
three times. 
RNA isolation. For RNA isolation, L. monocytogenes 10403S and ⌬sigB 
strains were initially grown overnight in 5 ml of BHI broth at 37°C with 
shaking (230 rpm), followed by subculturing twice, each time at an OD 600 
of 0.4, using a 1% (vol/vol) transfer into 5 ml of prewarmed BHI. When 
the second subculture reached an OD 600 of 0.4, cells were treated with a 
total volume of 76 l comprising FPSS (to yield final concentrations rang-
ing from 1 M to 128 M) and/or DMSO, followed immediately by 
addition of 324 l of either 5 M NaCl (to yield a final concentration of 
0.3 M NaCl, an osmotic stress that induces B activity [8]) or (ii) sterile 
distilled water. Treated cultures were then incubated at 37°C with shaking 
(230 rpm) for 10 min, followed by addition of 2 volumes of RNAprotect 
(Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and subsequent incubation at room temper-
ature for 10 min. The cells were harvested following centrifugation for 
10 min at 5,000 ϫ g, and cell pellets were stored at Ϫ80°C until RNA was 
extracted and DNase treated using an Ambion RiboPure kit (Ambion, 
Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concen-
trations and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectro-
photometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Rockland, DE). RNA quality was 
analyzed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, 
CA), and only RNA with an integrity number of Ն8 was used. Each treat-
ment was performed 3 times. 
TaqMan qRT-PCR. Transcript levels for the B -dependent genes 
opuCA and gadA and the housekeeping genes rpoB and gap were quanti-
fied with TaqMan primers and probes (13, 58, 71) using RNA prepared as 
described above and an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Ap-
plied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as previously described (71). qRT-PCR 
was also used to determine the FPSS IC 50 . Inhibition was measured using 
opuCA transcript levels determined with RNA isolated from cells treated 
with a series of 1:2 dilutions of FPSS, with concentrations ranging from 
128 to 1 M. These data were assessed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SigmaPlot</rs> 10.0 (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SYSTAT Software Inc.</rs>., Evanston, IL) standard curve analysis under the pharma-
cology function. 
Whole-genome microarray. cDNA labeling for microarray analyses 
and microarray hybridization were performed as previously described (5) 
using L. monocytogenes whole-genome microarrays (8, 72). Raw intensity 
values for all probes on each array were normalized using pin-tip <rs id="software-3" type="software">LOW-
ESS</rs> (8) in R <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">version 2.2.1</rs> with the LIMMA package. Signals from two 
replicate probes on each array were then averaged and log 2 transformed. 
Differences in transcript levels between strains were determined using a 
linear model, and P values were determined using eBayes. Differences in 
transcript levels were considered meaningful if they met the following 
three criteria: (i) adjusted P values of Ͻ0.05 (ii) absolute fold changes of 
Ն2 and (iii) a probe cross-hybridization index (CHI) of Ͼ90%. One gene 
(i.e., lmo0263) fulfilled criteria (i) and (ii) but not (iii) (probe CHI was 
80%) and therefore was not included in our analyses. 
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; Broad Institute, Cambridge, 
MA) (73) was used to identify gene sets that were significantly enriched 
among up-or downregulated genes. GSEA was run on the ranked list of 
log fold change values obtained from the fitted normalized data in 
LIMMA with 1,000 permutations and exclusion of gene sets with Ͻ5 or 
Ͼ2,000 members. Genes were classified into sets based on the TIGR Com-
prehensive Microbial Resource (http://cmr.tigr.org) subrole categories 
for L. monocytogenes EGD-e. False discovery rate q values of Ͻ0.25 were 
considered significant (73). 
Caco-2 invasion assay. L. monocytogenes invasion assays using the 
human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line Caco-2 (ATCC 
HTB-37) were performed as described by Garner et al. (9). L. monocyto-
genes 10403S and ⌬sigB strains were initially grown overnight in 5 ml of 
BHI broth at 37°C with shaking (230 rpm), then were subcultured twice, 
at an OD 600 of 0.4, using a 1% (vol/vol) transfer into 5 ml of prewarmed 
BHI. When the second subculture reached an OD 600 of 0.4, cells were 
treated with (i) FPSS to yield final concentrations of 64 M or 8 M 
(lowest concentration with full efficacy according to qRT-PCR) or (ii) </p>

<p>Pathogen experiments 
Staphylococcus aureus was cultured overnight at 37°C in BHI 
media, after which the culture was diluted 1:10 with the same 
media. This diluted solution (100 μl) was spread onto plates 
and incubated at 37°C for 6 h, followed by 6 h of cooling at 
20°C. For treatment with heat-killed pathogens, plates were 
incubated at 65°C for 6 h to kill the pathogen. Worms were 
transferred to prepared media (previously seeded with heat-
killed or live pathogens) and the live worms were counted every 
6 h until no living worms remained. Data are presented as 
mean survival days, which were calculated using the <rs type="software">OASIS</rs> 
program (Yang et al., 2011). </p>

each experiment. WT, wild type; ucp-4, ucp-4 mutant; egg, ani-
mals were exposed to the pathogen at the egg stage; L1-2, at L1-
2 stage; L3-4, at L3-4 stage; adult day 1, 5, and 10, at day 1, 5, 
and 10, respectively. Error bars = SD. *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01, based 
on a Student's t-test. </p>

<p>tants upon exposure to either live (pathogenic) or heat-killed 
(non-pathogenic) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). As seen 
in Fig. 4, the ucp-4 mutant had high ψ m compared to that of the 
wild type without pathogen exposure (Figs. 4A and 4C, respec-
tively). After pathogen exposure, there was no significant 
change in ψ m between live and heat-killed pathogen exposed 
ucp-4 mutants (Fig. 4D). In contrast, wild type worms showed 
an increase in ψ m upon exposure to live pathogens (Fig. 4B). 
This increased ψ m could be related to pathogen resistance; 
we therefore assayed worm survival. We placed animals on 
pathogen-seeded plates during each developmental stage, 
specifically egg, L1-2, L3-4, and adult day 1, 5, and 10. After 
the worms were transferred, surviving animals were counted 
each day until all were dead. We used the <rs type="software">OASIS</rs> program to 
calculate mean survival days based on the raw data (Yang et 
al., 2011). As seen in Fig. 4E, the ucp-4 mutant survived 
longer than the wild type when exposed to the pathogen at 
the egg stage, L1-2, L3-4, and the young adult stage (day 1). 
However, exposure at the aged adult stages (days 5 and 10) 
produced different results. Specifically, the ucp-4 mutants 
were more susceptible to the pathogen compared to wild type 
at this stage. 
Considering the increase in ψ m in wild type animals upon 
pathogen exposure, the resulting increase in ROS could serve 
to initiate an immune response. However, the ucp-4 mutant 
displayed high ROS levels without the presence of the patho-
gen, which could account for the observed resistance. As 
shown in Fig. 4, ucp-4 mutants exposed to pathogens at an 
early stage showed increased resistance, but were susceptible 
when exposed to the pathogen in an aged adult stage. This 
inconsistency between young and aged animals might be due 
to the free radical aging process and/or gradual ROS response 
(Hekimi et al., 2011). It was shown that silencing UCP2 in mac-
rophages resulted in increased ROS production that could kill 
the pathogen via direct oxidative damage. As a result, the 
UCP2 knocked-down macrophage showed enhanced re-
sistance to the Leishmania parasite (Basu Ball et al., 2011). 
When young ucp-4 mutants were exposed to the pathogen, the 
increased ROS could function as microbicidal molecules. In 
addition, increased ROS could facilitate an immune response-
during pathogen attack. Indeed, a recent study showed that 
moderately increased ROS in the mitochondria enhances im-
munity against pathogens via a feedback mechanism involving 
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) in C. elegans (Hwang et al., 2014). 
Alternatively, high levels of ROS can cause oxidative damage. 
It was observed that various organisms accumulated oxidative 
damage of macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids 
during aging (Back et al., 2012; Harman, 1956; 1972; 2009; 
Sohal and Weindruch, 1996). When ucp-4 mutants aged, their 
macromolecules could be progressively damaged by increased 
ROS. The cumulative damage via ROS and aging in the ucp-4 
mutant could cause susceptibility to the pathogen. ROS in-
creases can thus function in two opposite ways. The initial ROS 
increase against a pathogen attack could be beneficial to kill the 
pathogen and trigger an immune response. However, the con-
stant high level of ROS could cause deterioration of structures 
consisting of physical barriers to infection by pathogen. Since 
ROS can exert both positive and negative responses, the regu-
lation of ROS levels could be critical for innate immunity. This 
dual role is probably tightly linked to ROS balance; therefore, 
further studies are necessary to elucidate how the ROS bal-
ance in the innate immune system is sensed and regulated 
during pathogen exposure. </p>

However, evaluation of specifi c complications of interest 
included all cases with LOS of &gt; 4 days or re-admission. For 
multiple logistic regression analysis, we included variables 
previously found to infl uence outcome after fast-track THA 
and TKA (use of walking aids, preoperative anemia etc.) or 
related to increased BMI (hypertension, diabetes etc.). The 
model included 11 variables, with hospital of surgery added 
as a random effect. Analyses were done with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 20.</rs>. 
95% CI values for percentages were calculated at http://vas-

<p>This is the first randomized controlled trial report to date 
of using NIV ventilator equipped with built-in software to 
monitor the ventilator parameters in home setting in stable 
hypercapnic COPD patients. In order to estimate the accuracy 
of built-in software in ventilators, data downloaded from 
software were compared using the <rs type="software">PowerLab</rs> system. The 
finding showed that the estimation of leak and pressure was a 
low mean bias value between built-in software and <rs type="software">PowerLab</rs> 
system. Previous study showed that the rate of abnormali-
ties was 66% and leak was the most common abnormality 
(34.2%) followed by desaturation dips (23.8%) in home 
NPPV. 
19 In addition, studies have further reported that leak 
increases ineffective trigger, patient-ventilator asynchrony, 
and hypoventilation in patients.

estimation of leak was 37.99 L/min and 87% of the leaks </p>

<p>All nine protein kits were divided into a 5-plex panel and two 
2-plex panels with different dilution rates for each patients' 
samples. All samples were randomly divided into different 
plates to perform the Luminex test. The random number allo-
cation and grouping was done using <rs id="software-1" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">12</rs> software. </p>

<p>machine (SVM), and logistic regression -were performed 
with the R program package. The <rs id="software-3" type="software">R</rs> project of statistical 
computing (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Wirtschaftsuniversität</rs>, Wien, Austria) was used 
for classification analysis to develop the algorithms. 
The RF ensemble learning method, proposed by Breiman, 
is a combination of tree predictors where each tree depends 
on the values of a random vector sampled independently and 
with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. 
29 The 
idea behind SVMs is to construct a separating hyperplane 
or set of hyperplanes in a high or infinite dimensional space 
for classification. 
30 After obtaining results with the training 
set, each classification algorithm with different groups of 
classifiers was cross-validated with the validation set. The 
prediction performances with accuracy (number of patients or 
controls identical to the result of the classification/examined 
total number), sensitivity, and specificity were analyzed. The 
receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and 
the areas under the curves were calculated. A P-value of 0.05 
was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>A panel consisting of 25 microsatellite markers was selected for the 
diversity analysis of Tibetan sheep population. These were chosen from 
literature related with sheep diversity studies aiming to analyze highly 
polymorphic markers spread across the genome. These markers also 
adhere to the guidelines of International Society for Animal Genetics 
and FAO (http://dad.fao.org/en/refer/library/guidelin/marker.pdf). 
Detailed information on primers is presented in Table 1. Forward primer 
of each marker was 5′ labeled with fluorescent dye, i.e. FAM, NED, PET 
and VIC. PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 
25 μl on i-cycler. Reaction mixture consisted of 50-100 ng of genomic 
DNA, 200 μM of each dNTP, 50 pM of each primer and 0.5 units of Taq 
DNA polymerase. The amplification was carried out using a Touchdown 
program for all microsatellite loci, which consists of initial denaturation 
of 95°C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 60°C for 1 min, 3 cycle of 
95°C for 45 s and 57°C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 54°C for 
1 min, 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 51°C for 1 min and 20 cycles of 95°C 
for 45 s and 48°C for 1 min. The PCR amplification was confirmed by 
electrophoresing the products in 1.8% agarose gel followed by staining 
with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml). PCR products were multiplexed 
(Table 1) and genotyping was carried out on an automated ABI-3100 
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) using LIZ 500 as the 
internal size standard (Applied Biosystems, USA). Allele sizing was 
done using <rs id="software-0" type="software">GeneMapper™</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v 3.7</rs>. Stutter related scoring 
error, often seen in dinucleotide repeats, was absent and alleles could 
be scored unambiguously. </p>

<p>Basic genetic parameters including allele frequencies, observed (No) 
and effective number of alleles (Ne), observed (Ho) and expected 
heterozygosity (He) and heterozygote deficit (F IS ) in the whole popula-
tion were calculated by analyzing the genetic data with GenAlEx 6.2 
software (Peakall and Smouse, 2008). Tests of Hardy-Weinberg equilib-
rium and Ewens-Watterson Neutrality were applied using <rs id="software-1" type="software">POPGENE</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">1.31 version</rs> (Yeh et al., <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">1999</rs>). Bottleneck events in the population 
were tested by three methods. The first method consisted of three ex-
cess heterozygosity tests developed by Cornuet and Luikart (1996): 
(i) Sign test, (ii) Standardized differences test, and (iii) a Wilcoxon </p>

<p>7 femoral zones described by Gruen. Osteolysis was defi ned 
as a non-linear lucency of 3 mm or more around the prosthesis 
(Claus et al. 2003). Loosening of an acetabular component was 
determined from evidence of migration and a radiolucent line 
(Hodgkinson et al. 1988, Johnston et al. 1990). An acetabu-
lar component was diagnosed as "loose" when it had migrated 
more than 4 mm in either the horizontal or the vertical direc-
tion, or if it had tilted by more than 5°. Cemented acetabular 
components that had continuous radiolucent lines with any 
thickness in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Unce-
mented acetabular components that had radiolucent lines wider 
than 2 mm in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. 
Loosening of an uncemented stem was defi ned by whether the 
stem was considered to be unstable according to the criteria of 
Engh et al. (1990). Loosening of a cemented stem was defi ned 
by whether we found a continuous radiolucent line around 
the stem, or stem subsidence of &gt; 5 mm. Bone defects were 
assessed using Paprosky's classifi cations (Paprosky et al. 1994, 
Della Valle and Paprosky 2004). Bone areas with reduced den-
sity in the acetabulum and proximal femur were recorded as 
"atrophy" (Wangen et al. 2008). Thinning of the femoral cortex 
adjacent to a well-fi xed stem was recorded as "cortical atro-
phy" (Figure 2). Heterotopic ossifi cation was defi ned using the 
classifi cation of Brooker et al. (1973). In 3 hips, the proximal 
femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, so we evaluated 
the acetabular component only. In 1 hip, all the implants had 
been removed, so we assessed bone defects only. Leg-length 
discrepancy (LLD) was assessed by comparing the heights of 
greater or lesser trochanters relative to the line connecting the 
teardrops of the acetabulum. If the deformity was severe or if 
the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, we 
did not evaluate the patient's LLD. For analysis radiographs, 
we used <rs id="software-1" type="software">Mdesk Orthopaedics</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">RSA Biomedical</rs>,

<p>Statistics 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the 
survival after the primary THR and the fi rst revision surgery. 
We performed time-trend analyses to assess changes in the 
revision rate between the periods 1987-1995 and 1996-2010.

<p>Statistical Analysis 
The pre-and postoperative clinical outcomes were com-
pared using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. 
The Mann-Whitney test was used to assess differences re-
gard ing gender, age, range of motion and muscle strength 
in the groups, as divided according to the tear size, and the 
as sociation between the preoperative Global fatty de gen-
eration index (GFDI) and the final outcome. Correlation 
between the preoperative tear size and the retear rate was 
assessed using Pearson's chi-square test. Statistical analyses 
were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver.12.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago,

were compared with 6 other species, and conservation was 
recorded. Splice site mutations were analyzed in silico using the 
<rs type="software">BDGP Splice Site Prediction</rs> by Neural Network program, </p>

<p>transfection with a single mutation and an empty vector. A

created using the homology modeling program <rs type="software">ESyPred3D</rs> 
based on the crystal structure of holo glycine decarboxylase 
from Synechocystis (Protein Data Bank ID: 4LHC).

were viewed using the program <rs id="software-1" type="software">RasTop 2.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.genein-finity.org/rastop</rs>/). </p>

<p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. The dif-
ference between severe and attenuated variables is evaluated by 
Student t test for variables that have normal distribution, and 
by Mann-Whitney U test for variables that are not normally 
distributed as evaluated with Wilk-Shapiro. Subcategories of 
attenuated NKH were evaluated by 1-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). The significance of a difference in proportion is cal-
culated by the chi-square test. Pearson and Spearman correla-
tion tests were conducted to identify the correlation between 
outcomes and predictors, and identify colinearity among the 
predictors according to the data distribution. Multiple linear 
regression was performed to model the DQ in relation to pre-
dictors. Multiple ordinal logistic regression was performed to 
model the relationship between predictors and disease severity 
or AEDs. <rs id="software-4" type="software">SPSS</rs> Statistics package <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 21</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">IBM, Armonk,NY</rs>) and <rs id="software-5" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">version 9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">SAS, Cary, NC</rs>) were used to per-

significant. </p>

<p>Data analyses 
The number of persons passing through the staircases 
was expressed per 24 h. Because the absolute number of 
passages differed substantially between the 15 different 
measurement sites, counts were expressed as percentage 
of baseline average. Baseline average was defined as the 
mean number of passages per 24 h over all days of the 
baseline period at each measurement site. After rescal-
ing, all separate observations were included in linear 
regression models that were used to calculate the average 
percentage change in stair use over all measurement sites 
during the intervention period and during the 2 weeks 
thereafter. To increase model precision, a variable 
'weekend day (yes/no)' was included to account for the 
reduced number of staff during the weekends. Similar to 
one previous study, 
16 results are presented with and 
without additional adjustment for the number of hospital 
restaurant customers on each day, reflecting variations in 
building occupancy. Results were stratified by hospital 
wing and floor level to assess the consistency of our find-
ings. Recordings of the number of passages through the 
staircases from one measurement site were missing on 
three separate days (0.4% of all measurements) owing to 
technical failure of the person counter. These were 
excluded from the analyses. 
The average numbers of clear soup cups and cream 
soup cups purchased on weekdays during each study 
period were expressed per 1000 restaurant visitors and as 
the ratio between the two. Similarly, the average numbers 
of butter and margarine servings purchased on weekdays 
during each study period were also expressed per 1000 
restaurant visitors and as the ratio between the two. The 
average numbers of butter croissants and lean croissants, 
however, were expressed as the average number pur-
chased until the first type was sold out and the ratio 
between those two. p Values for difference between the 
intervention period and the baseline period and between 
the after-intervention period and the baseline period 
were based on unpaired t tests. Few missing data on con-
sumption of croissants (n=2; 7%), soup cups (n=1; 3%) 
and margarine or butter (n=1; 3%) that occurred due to 
study personnel's incidental incompliance with the study 
protocol were excluded from the analyses.

<p>Biases in the rates at which duplications form in different 
genomic regions or a greater propensity for selection to 
favor duplications in specific functional classes can result in 
a bias in gene ontology (GO) categories among duplicated 
genes. We used <rs type="software">DAVID GO</rs> analysis software to identify over-
represented functions among duplicate genes in D. yakuba 
and D. simulans. In D. yakuba, we observe 678 duplicated 
genes with orthologs in D. melanogaster. Overrepresented 
functional categories include immunoglobulins, extracellular 
matrix, chitins and aminoglycans, immune response and 
wound healing, drug and hormone metabolism, chorion de-
velopment, chemosensory response and development, and 
morphogenesis (supplementary table S13, Supplementary 
Material online). In D. simulans, we observe 478 duplicated 
genes with orthologs in D. melanogaster. Overrepresented GO 
categories include cytochromes and oxidoreductases plus 
toxin metabolism, immune response to microbes, phosopho-
lipid 
metabolism, 
chemosensory 
processing, </p>

<p>The sequencing reads were aligned to the appropriate refer-
ence genome (Drosophila Twelve Genomes Consortium 
2007; Hu et al. 2013) using bwa <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 0.5.9</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Li and Durbin</rs> </p>

<p>2009) with the following parameters, bwa aln Àl 13 Àm 
50000000 ÀR 5000. The resulting paired-end mappings 
were resolved via the "sampe" module of bwa (bwa sampe 
Àa 5000 ÀN 5000 Àn 500), and the output was sorted and 
converted into a "bam" file using <rs id="software-2" type="software">samtools</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 0.1.18</rs> 
(Li et al. <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-date">2009</rs>). In the alignment and resolution commands, 
Àl is the hash sized used for seeding alignments, and the 
ÀR, Àa, ÀN, and Àn refer to how many alignments are 
recorded for reads mapping to multiple locations in the ref-
erence. After the paired-end mapping resolution, the bam 
files from each lane of sequencing were merged into a 
single bam file sorted according to position along the refer-
ence genome. A second bam file, sorted by read name, was 
then created for use as input into our clustering software. </p>

<p>We used <rs id="software-5" type="software">DAVID GO</rs> analysis software (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov</rs>/, last accessed March 2013) to determine whether 
any functional categories were overrepresented at duplicated </p>

<p>genes. Functional data for D. yakuba and D. simulans are not 
readily available in many cases, and thus we identified func-
tional classes in the D. melanogaster orthologs as classified in 
Flybase. GO clustering threshold was set to low and signifi-
cance was defined using a cutoff of EASE ! 1:0: The <rs type="software">DAVID</rs> 
clustering software uses Fuzzy Heuristic Partitioning to iden-
tify genes with related functional terms at all levels of GO 
from cellular processes to known phenotypes. </p>

<p>Mediterranean Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) is used for treatment of inflammatory conditions 
and neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently C. tinctorius lignans arctigenin and trachelogenin but not 
matairesinol were described to interfere with the activity of tryptophan-degrading enzyme indoleamine 
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro . We examined a potential direct 
influence of compounds on IDO enzyme activity applying computational calculations based on 3D ge-
ometry of the compounds. The interaction pattern analysis and force field-based minimization was 
performed within <rs id="software-3" type="software">LigandScout</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">3.03</rs>, the docking simulation with <rs id="software-4" type="software">MOE</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">2011.10</rs> using the X-ray crystal 
structure of IDO. Results confirm the possibility of an intense interaction of arctigenin and trachelogenin 
with the binding site of the enzyme, while matairesinol had no such effect. 
The herbaceous Asteraceae plant Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) 
has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to promote circula-
tion and menstruation [ 1 ] and to treat neuropsychological disorders 
such as major depression [ 2 ]. In the Mediterranean area, C. tinctorius 
extracts play a role in the treatment of cancer and are known for an-
tihelmintic, antiseptic, diuretic and febrifugal properties [ 3 ]. Most of 
the clinical conditions mentioned are associated with immune activa-
tion and inflammation which is characterized by specific biochemical 
alterations. Among them alterations of tryptophan metabolism ap-
pear to be most prominent. Tryptophan breakdown due to enzyme 
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is involved in several physiologi-
cal and pathophysiological conditions. IDO is an iso-enzyme of trypto-
phan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), and both enzymes catalyze the first and 
rate limiting step of tryptophan catabolism namely the conversion of </p>

<p>During the docking simulation the previously energetically mini-
mized molecules were placed within the binding pocket of a protein, 
generating a set of energetically favorable poses. These poses are then 
ranked according to a score that the docking program assigns to each 
pose, estimating the binding free energy. The best ranked pose of each 
molecule was then further optimized and a three dimensional repre-
sentation of its interaction pattern, a pharmacophore, was calculated 
to analyze the structure-activity relationship. 
The possible direct interaction of the three lignans with IDO 
was simulated, 3D geometries of trachelogenin, arctigenin, and 
matairesinol were calculated with Discovery Studio [ 13 ] and ener-
getically minimized with <rs id="software-6" type="software">Omega</rs> <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">2.2.1.</rs>. [ 14 ]. The docking simulation 
was performed with the software package <rs id="software-7" type="software">MOE</rs> <rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">2011.10</rs> [ 15 ] using 
the X-ray crystal structure of IDO (Protein Data Bank entry 2d0t ) [ 16 ]. 
A pharmacophore of the metal binding feature was generated within 
LigandScout 3.03 [ 17 ] based on the ligand (4-phenyl-imidazole) co-
crystallized in the crystal structure and used as a constraint in the 
docking simulation. This means that the docked ligand must form a 
coordinated interaction with the heme iron ion from the IDO active 
site. For the docking, the A chain of 2d0t, which was crystallized as 
a dimer, was used. The original ligand 4-phenyl-imidazole, the two 
co-crystallized detergent molecules of 2-[ N -cyclohexylamino]ethane 
sulfonic acid, and water were removed. The binding site of the origi-
nal ligand was chosen for the docking. The program defines the open 
space in the binding pocket with so called alpha spheres that rep-
resent available atom positions. Placement was done by the triangle 
matcher algorithm using standard settings. The triangle matcher al-
gorithm generates poses by aligning triplets of ligand atoms with 
triplets of alpha spheres to find possible binding orientations of the 
ligand within the binding site. 
Rescoring was performed with London [ 18 ] and GBVI / WSA 
(Generalized-Born Volume Integral / Weighted Surface area) [ 19 ] scor-
ing functions to rank the resulting poses of each molecule. The London 
scoring function estimates the free energy of a pose by forming a sum 
of energy term (considering ligand flexibility, H-bonds and desolva-
tion) and geometric imperfections. The GBVI / WSA estimates the elec-
trostatic solvation using a weighted solvent-accessible surface area. 
For structure activity analysis the best ranked docking pose of each 
molecule was energetically minimized within LigandScout using the 
Merck Molecular Force Field 94 (MMFF94) force field for optimiza-
tion of the intermolecular interactions. 3D Protein-ligand interaction </p>

<p>SMART Project during a regu-
larly scheduled clinic appointment. 
Informed assent and parental 
consent were obtained, partici-
pants were oriented to the SMART 
Project, and adolescents completed 
a demographics and medical his-
tory questionnaire. Participants 
were registered in the <rs type="software">SMART 
Project program</rs>, a two-way text 
message software program con-
tracted through Reify Health of 
Baltimore, Md., and the timing of 
texts was customized according to 
their schedules. Participants were 
instructed to choose morning (before 
school), afternoon (after school), 
evening (before bed), and weekend 
mid-morning times. Glucose meters 
were downloaded, and medical 
charts were reviewed for A1C results. 
Participants were compensated with 
a $25 gift card. 
Subsequently, participants 
received text messages for 6 weeks. 
During Week 1, participants were 
prompted to text their blood glucose 
levels three times per day (morning, 
afternoon, and evening). During 
Weeks 2-5, they received text mes-
sages 2 times per day (morning and 
either afternoon or evening) regard-
ing topics related to type 1 diabetes, 
including blood glucose monitoring 
(Week 2), nutrition (Week 3), physi-
cal activity (Week 4), and sleep/mood 
(Week 5). Texts included two parts: 
type 1 diabetes-related information 
and tips and a request to respond to 
a specific question. During Week 6, </p>

<p>Cell phone use. A four-item ques-
tionnaire was developed by our team 
to assess adolescents' cell phone use. 
Participants reported how many days 
per week they used their cell phone 
to text, how many texts they sent per 
day, how many days per week they 
talked on their cell phone, and how 
many hours they talk on the phone 
per day. 
Text message data. Participants' 
responses to SMART Project text 
messages were collected via the <rs type="software">Reify 
Health</rs> software program, and the 
time and verbatim text of text mes-
sages were downloaded. From these 
data, response rates and response 
latency were calculated. Overall 
and weekly response rates were 
calculated as the percentage of texts 
to which an adolescent responded. 
For Weeks 1 and 6, adolescents 
were supposed to text their blood 
glucose levels three times per day 
(morning, afternoon, and evening); 
thus, the denominator in the Week

<p>Complications were divided into minor and major compli-
cations. Minor complications were defined as seroma, 
hematoma and fat necrosis without compromised flap 
perfusion. Major complications were defined as flap 
compromise due to venous congestion or arterial insuffi-
ciency at the anastomosis site and thrombosis of the 
microvascular bed with the need for immediate reexplo-
ration to prevent partial or total flap loss. Furthermore, 
deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were 
defined as major complications. Data analyis was per-
formed using the Chi-square-test. A p-value less than 0.05 
was considered statistically significant. SPSS statistical

<p>flammatory response (85 altered genes), and obesity (23 altered 
genes) were found (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these results, the 
gene SCD5, which had the greatest difference between the two 
groups (fold change, 6.239; P ϭ 0.00005), encodes primate-
specific stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase, which has a key 
function in the catalysis of monounsaturated fatty acids from sat-
urated fatty acids. The promoter region of SCD5 was more meth-
ylated in the HighFirm group and had an undetectable methyl-
ation in the HighBact group. LPS (P ϭ 0.00208) was one of the 
upstream regulators of genes identified in the network (see Ta-
ble S3), which further strengthens the role of microbial molecules 
in epigenetic modifications. 
Some of the epigenetically regulated genes include the genes 
encoding USF1 (P ϭ 0.00805), ACOT7 (P ϭ 0.035), ASAH2 (P ϭ 
0.0367), TAC1 (P ϭ 0.00972), and LMNA (P ϭ 0.03081). USF1 is 
one of the key regulators of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and is also a 
key enzyme in lipogenesis (14). USF1 and LMNA have also been 
linked with the onset of coronary heart disease (15, 16). The ex-
pression of ACOT and microRNAs 103/107 was also found to be 
upregulated in obese rats and mice, respectively (17, 18). Simi-
larly, gut microbiota or its metabolites are directly linked to obe-
sity and associated metabolic pathways. However, the association 
with epigenetic regulation of these genes should be further con-
firmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and in vitro experiments. 
These findings are consistent with previous studies, which have 
linked higher levels of Firmicutes to the development of over-
weight, obesity, higher energy extraction, and metabolic func-
tions, including lipid metabolism. Additionally, deviant gut mi-
crobiota composition could also be one of the risk factors which 
may contribute to metabolic syndrome. Our findings are novel, 
but due to the small sample size, larger studies and interventions, 
and possibly animal experiments also, are required to assess the 
mechanisms. Nonetheless, this approach is intriguing and could 
offer a new basis for prevention and treatment strategies involving 
the gut microbiota and its impact on long-term genomic modifi-
cations. 
Microbial phylum comparisons. All the OTU tables were re-
trieved from our earlier study (10).The percentages of relative 
abundance for all phyla were used to compare the mothers (di-
vided into two groups). Statistical package <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> was used for the </p>

<p>t test and to make box plots of the percentages of relative abun-
dance. 
DNA methylome analysis. The DNA methylome analysis was 
carried out from 5 g of genomic DNA that was extracted from 
EDTA blood with a QIAamp DNA blood maxikit (Qiagen) and 
fragmented into an average size of 150 bp with a Covaris S2 soni-
cator. Methylated DNA was enriched with a MethylMiner meth-
ylated DNA enrichment kit (Invitrogen) by following the high-salt 
(2 M NaCl), single-elution workflow. The sequencing libraries 
were prepared from 500 ng of enriched DNA with a SOLiD frag-
ment library construction kit (Life Technologies), and the SOLiD 
fragment library barcoding kit module 1-16 (Life Technologies) 
was used for multiplexing. The libraries were purified (AMPure 
XP beads; Agencourt) and size selected (150 to 300 bp) from 1% 
agarose gels (QIAquick gel extraction kit; Qiagen). The bead prep-
aration was carried out according to the SOLiD 4 System Tem-
plated Bead Preparation Guide. The SOLiDEZ bead system was 
used for automated templated bead preparation. The libraries 
were sequenced with a SOLiD 4 or SOLiD 5500XL sequencer (Life 
Technologies) by using 50-bp chemistry. 
Methylation sequencing data analysis. The raw sequence data 
were mapped to hg19 reference genome sequences with <rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Life Tech-nologies</rs> <rs id="software-4" type="software">Bioscope</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 2.0</rs>) software using the default param-
eters, yielding on average 56.7 M mapped reads per sample (stan-
dard deviation, 14.26 M reads). The read counts for proximal 
promoters (region between 1,000 bp upstream and 500 bp down-</p>

<p>stream from the transcription start site, coordinates derived from 
RefSeq gene annotations) were calculated using bedtools (version 
2.17.0). Statistical analysis for comparing differentially methyl-
ated promoters between sample groups was carried out using 
R/<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Bioconductor</rs> <rs id="software-6" type="software">limma</rs> package on TMM-normalized and voom-
transformed count values as suggested in the limma manual (19, 20). 
The promoters with absolute fold changes above 2 and P values 
below 0.05 were listed as significantly differentially methylated. </p>

<p>whole-blood epigenetic profile and the composition of the gut microbial population of the mothers with a predominance of either Bacteroidetes and Proteobac-
teria (group HighBact) or Firmicutes (group HighFirm). Green indicates decreased and red indicates increased gene promoter methylation in group HighFirm 
compared to the promoter methylation in group HighBact. (B) Based on <rs id="software-3" type="software">Pathway Analysis</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Ingenuity Systems</rs>), the gut microbial composition affects the DNA 
methylation status of genes primarily linked to cardiac diseases, with associations to lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and obesity. The affected genes 
linked to the particular functional or metabolic syndrome displayed in the network had fold changes of Ն3 in the promoter DNA methylation status between the 
HighBact group and the HighFirm group. The symbols and their colors are defined in Table S4 in the supplemental material. </p>

<p>. The data was batch-
normalization for compatibility of experiments. Microarray data are submitted to 
GEO/NCBI (GSE26520). Two shRNA were used for the majority of TFs and we 
treated them as biological replications using ANOVA. Some of these experiments 
included also 2 technical replications where cells were split after transfection cultured 
separately and RNA was hybridized to separate microarrays. Further details on cell 
manipulation and data analysis can be found in the project website: 
http://esbank.nia.nih.gov/. For statistical analysis we used <rs type="software">NIA Array Analysis</rs>, which 
estimates the False Discovery Rate (FDR) to account for multiple hypothesis testing 
24 . 
All genes shown as significant in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S2 satisfy stringent 
statistical criteria (FDR , 0.05, fold change .2). Response of genes to the knockdown 
of TFs was measured as a logratio (i.e., difference between mean log-transformed 
expression in the knockdown experiment and global median expression). Principal 
component analysis (PCA) of log-transformed gene expression was done using genes 
that showed statistically significant change in their expression (FDR , 0.05) with 
SVD method applied to the covariance matrix of log-transformed gene expression 
values within the <rs type="software">NIA Array Analysis</rs>. 
Published ChIP-seq data on binding of 28 TFs (Supplementary Table 4) was 
compiled from either provided lists of gene symbols, or genome locations of binding 
sites. We used a distance of 15 Kb from the TSS as a generic threshold for associating 
binding sites with specific genes. TFs associated with ES cell pluripotency are often 
co-localized on DNA, making multiple transcription factor-binding loci (MTLs) 
16 . 
Because these loci are associated with the binding of at least 4 TFs, they are highly 
reliable and can be used for detecting enhancers located far from the TSS. We used 
MTLs to add information on enhancers located within 200 Kb from the TSS for 
Pou5f1, Sox2, Nanog, Esrrb, Tclcp2l1, Klf4, Stat3, and Sall4 (Supplementary Table 4). 
For the TFs that have multiple sets of targets in our database, we selected the data that 
yielded highest enrichment scores (PAGE, see below) for sets of genes affected by 
manipulation of TFs, or combined multiple data sets. 
Enrichment of target genes in subsets of genes that are upregulated and/or 
downregulated following the manipulation of a TF is quantified using a modified 
Parametric Analysis of Gene Enrichment (PAGE) 
25 . PAGE is based on the 
comparison of the average expression change in a specific subset of genes, x set , with 
the average expression change in all genes, x all : </p>

<p>. Thus, it is reasonable to use 
equation (1) as approximation. 
For the heatmap (Fig. 5b), we selected 2046 named genes (excluding olfactory 
receptors and Riken clones) with .1.5 fold median change following the knockdown 
of Pou5f1 and Sox2 (trajectory 1) or knockdown of Esrrb, Sall4, Nanog, and Tcfap4 
(trajectory 2). These genes were then classified into 6 response groups as follows: if the 
logratio of gene expression change was .2 fold greater following one trajectory that 
another trajectory, then the gene was considered specific to the former trajectory. A 
small number of genes (N 5 18) responded in opposite directions following 
trajectories 1 and 2. We classified them according to the strongest absolute value of 
the median logratio of gene expression change. Within each group, genes were sorted 
using hierarchical clustering, <rs id="software-2" type="software">TMEV</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">ver. 3.1</rs>

<p>Flow cytometry based binding assays. Mid-log phase P. aeruginosa 
strains were concentrated in PBS to an OD 650 of 2.0. After incubation of 
antibody (10 µg/ml) and bacteria (1e7 cells) for 1 h at 4°C with shaking, 
washed cells were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-human IgG 
antibody (Invitrogen) for 0.5 h at 4°C. Washed cells were stained with 
BacLight Green Bacterial Stain as recommended (Invitrogen). For ex vivo 
binding, 0.1 ml of bacterial inocula was prepared from an overnight TSA 
plate and delivered intraperitoneally to BALB/c mice. 4 h after challenge, 
bacteria were harvested, and RBCs were lysed, sonicated, and resuspended 
in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 1% BSA. Samples were 
stained and run on an LSR II flow cytometer (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">BD</rs>) and analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">FAC-
SDiva</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v. 6.1.3</rs>; BD) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">FlowJo</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">v. 9.2</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Tree Star</rs>). </p>

<p>Octet measurements. Affinity of antibodies was analyzed using the 
ForteBio Octet 384 instrument with 384 slanted well plates (ForteBio). 
PAO1 was grown overnight at 37°C at 200 RPM, followed by removal of 
cells by centrifugation. The culture supernatant, which served as the Psl 
source, was then loaded onto Octet aminopropylsilane (hydrated in PBS) 
sensors (300 s). The sensors were blocked with PBS-B (300 s), followed by 
the addition of anti-Psl mAbs that ranged from 7.8 to 10,000 nM (400 s). 
Disassociation was performed with PBS-B (400 s). For Octet carbohydrate 
capture experiments, antibodies were loaded onto aminopropylsilane 
(hydrated in PBS) sensors (300 s) at 10 µg/ml, followed by blocking with 
PBS-B (100 s). Enriched carbohydrate solution was then flowed over the 
sensors (300 s), followed by washing to remove unbound material (100 s). 
Unlabeled antibodies (10 µg/ml) were then flowed over the sensors. All 
steps were performed using a 3-mm sensor offset with 0.6 Hz sensitivity. 
Data were exported to <rs id="software-2" type="software">Prism</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">GraphPad</rs>) for analysis of binding and for 
Global Association/Disassociation affinity curve fitting. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-3" type="software">GraphPad 
Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">version 5.01</rs> software. For survival studies, data are presented as 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and were analyzed by the log-rank test. For 
comparison of the numbers of viable bacteria obtained from lung, spleen, 
kidney, and eye homogenates, Cam-003-treated animals were compared 
with R347-treated animals using the Mann-Whitney U test. </p>

<p>Confocal microscopy analysis. Drosophila S2 cells were plated in 12-well plastic 
tissue culture plate in 1 ml of Schneider's medium with 10% FBS. FITC-labeled 
(Invitrogen, USA) microbes were added to each well containing S2 cells at a density of 
5 3 10 
6 , followed by incubation for 1 hr at 28uC. After washes with PBS, the S2 cells 
were transferred to Poly-Prep glass slides (Sigma, USA) and fixed. Then the S2 cells 
were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen, USA) or DAPI (Sigma, USA) 
to label actin or nucleus DNA, respectively. Fluorescent images were taken with a 
Zeiss Laser scanning systems LSM 510 Meta (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and processed 
using <rs type="software">Zeiss LSM Image</rs> Examiner Version software. </p>

<p>Analyses of gene expressions with oligonucleotide microarray. S2 cells (1 3 10 
6 ) 
were inoculated with DCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 hr. 
Inactivated DCV was treated in the same way. The WSSV virions (1 3 10 
7 copies/ 
mL) or inactivated WSSV virions (1 3 10 
7 copies/mL) were inoculated into S2 cells 
(1 3 10 
6 cells/mL) for 1 hr. Then total RNA was extracted from treated S2 cells by 
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
The total RNA samples were then analyzed by CapitalBio Corp for Chip (Affymetrix) 
assay. Gene expression analysis was performed by using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, 
CA, USA) Drosophila GeneChip, using the laboratory methods in the Affymetrix 
GeneChip expression manual. Gene expression analysis was performed using 
multiple arrays and multiple independent mRNA samples for each treatment. 
Microarray data were analyzed by using Bio MAS (<rs id="software-4" type="software">molecule annotation system</rs>) <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">3.0</rs> 
software (CapitalBio Corporation, Beijing, China). Using the criterion of cutoff 
limitation as a fold change $2 or #0.5 and q-value #5%, differential expression genes 
were screened and clustered. </p>

<p>Biological pathway analysis. Through array analysis, the commonly altered genes 
were screened from DCV, and WSSV treatments. The selected genes were further 
analyzed in the context of Gene Ontology (GO) biological process and Kyoto 
Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biological pathway. Then the results 
of signaling pathway and protein interaction about these genes were analyzed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">MAS</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.0</rs> software. To reveal the functions of predicted target genes, we used the ontology 
classification of genes based on gene annotation and summary information available 
through DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery). </p>

using rp49 as an internal control in S2 cells. Real-time PCR was carried out in a final 
volume of 20 ml, which contained 10 ml Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Japan), 1 ml diluted 
cDNA template, 7.2 ml distilled water, 0.3 ml of each TaqMan probe and 0.4 ml of each 
primer. PCR conditions were as follows, 95uC for 30 seconds, followed by 50 cycles of 
95uC for 5 seconds and 60uC for 30 seconds. Resultant data were analyzed using the 
<rs type="software">iQTM5</rs> software. </p>

<p>WSSV quantitative analysis by TaqMan real-time PCR. TaqMan real-time PCR 
was performed by using a Perfect Real Time premix (Takara, Japan) containing a 
high-performance Taq antibody, Takara Ex Taq HS, for hotstart real-time PCR. 
<rs type="software">Primer 3</rs> software was used to design primers and the TaqMan probe with the WSSV 
whole sequence (GenBank accession no. AF332093). Primers WSSV-RT1 (59-TTGG 
TTTCATGCCCGAGATT-39) and WSSV-RT2 (59-CCTTGGTCAGCCCCTTGA-
39) produced a fragment of 154 bp after amplification. The TaqMan probe was 
synthesized and labeled with the fluorescent dyes 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) (59-
FAM-TGCTGCCGTCTCCAA-TAMRA-39). The reaction mixture consisted of 
DNA aliquot, 200 nM of each primer, 100 nM of each TaqMan probe, and 1 3 PCR 
reaction buffer containing DNA polymerase in a final reaction volume of 20 ml. PCR 
amplification was performed for 4 min at 50uC, followed by 45 cycles of 45 s at 95uC, 
45 s at 52uC and 45 s at 72uC. Thermal cycling was performed on an iCycle IQ5 real-
time PCR detection system (Bio-RAD, USA). </p>

(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). T-tests were performed to 
compare the exposed and control groups, and multiple linear 
regression analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis was 
used to analyze the relationship between parameters. In the 
multiple logistic regression analysis, subjects with results in the 
upper 25% of HOMA-IR were considered part of the group 
having insulin resistance, and the lower 75% was considered 
part of normal group. Subjects with fasting plasma glucose lev-</p>

<p>Statistical methods 
The HRQoL scores that form the raw data for this analysis 
are rank-order in nature. Means and SDs of the scores 
were estimated using generalised estimating equations 
for illustrative purposes only. Physical and mental com-
posite scores were calculated in the modified SF-36 
according to the SF-12 scoring guidelines.

comparison and covariate effect size calculation, OR 
(with 95% CIs and p values) were estimated using 
repeated measures of ordinal logistic regression, with cov-
ariates selected for inclusion by backward stepwise regres-
sion ( p-value for exclusion 0.22) from maternal age, Hb, 
ferritin, Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas ( based on 
the Collector District of residence of mothers), quality of 
sleep, use and duration of breastfeeding, hospitalisation 
of the baby, baby gender and mode of delivery. This 
included randomisation group covariate interactions in 
the starting model with exclusion of those interactions 
using the above criteria. When iron status was selected 
for inclusion in the model, the association between iron 
status (ferritin) and HRQoL was reported independently 
of the trial treatment group. p Values were corrected for 
multiple comparisons where necessary by the Holm 
method. The effect of intravenous iron versus oral iron 
on time of cessation of breastfeeding was compared by 
estimation of the HR with 95% CIs and p values by Cox 
proportional hazards regression adjusted for covariates 
selected for inclusion by backward stepwise regression 
( p-value for exclusion 0.22). The time to cessation of 
breast-feeding was taken from the subject's baby growth 
booklet for all participants. Neonatal growth in the treat-
ment groups was compared by multivariate third-order 
polynomial regression as an approximation to APEG 
growth assessment. The iron status variables used in the 
multivariate regression models were selected by stepwise 
regression. All HRQoL statistical analyses were performed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Stata SE</rs> for Windows <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.11.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">StataCorp</rs>, College

pH 7.4, for 2 h at 4°C. The tissues were then dehydrated in a series of ethanol 
solutions (10min washes in 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100% ethanol) and em 
bedded in LR white resin. Thin sections (85 nm) were prepared at a depth 
of 30-40 µm and were examined by transmission EM using a transmission 
electron microscope (model 1230; JEOL) at room temperature. The images 
were acquired using a bottommount chargecoupled device camera (Ultra 
scan 1000; Gatan, Inc.), and <rs id="software-0" type="software">Digital Micrograph</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Gatan, Inc.</rs>.)

<p>LysoTracker staining of dissected ommatidia 
Ommatidia from adult flies were dissected in glass culture dishes (MatTek) 
filled with Schneider's Drosophila medium (Wang et al., 2008). The disso 
ciated ommatidia were attached to polydlysine-coated glass surfaces by 
placing in an incubator for 12 h at room temperature. The ommatidia were 
washed once in PBS, and the cells were subsequently loaded with 100 nM 
LysoTracker red DND99 for 20 min under light condition. Live cell images 
were acquired using a microscope (Eclipse; Nikon) with a PlanApochromat 
40× air immersion objective, and images were acquired with a charge 
coupled device camera (CoolSNAP HQ2; Roper Scientific) at room tem 
perature and <rs id="software-1" type="software">NISElements</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Nikon</rs>). The images were transferred

<p>Anatomical and perfusion images were 
acquired on a 3T GE HDx MRI scanner 
using three-dimensional magnetization 
prepared rapid gradient echo, fluid atten-
uated inversion recovery, and three-
dimensional continuous arterial spin 
labeling sequences (11). Regional cerebral 
vasoreactivity to CO 2 challenges (CO 2 VR) 
was measured as blood flow response 
to hypercapnia (CO 2 rebreathing with 
95% air and 5% CO 2 ) and hyperventila-
tion (12,13). CO 2 VR was calculated as the 
slope of the regression between perfusion 
and CO 2 during normocapnia, hypercap-
nia, and hypocapnia. Flow augmentation 
during hypercapnia (i.e., vasodilation 
response, CO 2 VR-VD) and flow reduc-
tion during hyperventilation (i.e., vaso-
constriction response, CO 2 VR-VC) were 
quantified. Magnetization prepared rapid 
gradient echo and fluid attenuated inver-
sion recovery images were coregistered 
to a standard template and segmented 
to calculate regional brain tissue and 
WMH volumes normalized for intracra-
nial volume (SPM<rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">7</rs>, University College

maps were coregistered with anatomical 
images. </p>

<p>Animals and diets. The study was approved by Ben-Gurion University In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IL-35-2006) and conducted 
according to the Israeli Animal Welfare Act, following the guidelines of the 
Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 
1996). Male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) at 6 
weeks of age were fed a low-fat diet (LFD; 6% calories from fat; Harlan Teklad 
2018sc) or an HFD (60% calories from fat; Research Diets #12492), as pre-
viously performed (17). 
Mice were killed by CO 2 at the indicated times, and periepididymal fat was 
dissected out and immediately fixed in 4% formaldehyde or snap-frozen and 
stored in liquid nitrogen until further analyzed. A combination of two oligonu-
cleotides antisenses (AS) (TCAAAGGTCTCATTCCACA, GCTGTCAGGGGTTG-
TAG) and their corresponding senses, with phosphorothioate modifications 
on the last three bases at both 59 and 39 ends, was used as described pre-
viously (18). 
For insulin stimulation, insulin was administered intravenously 5 min before 
the mice were killed, and livers or epididymal fat pads were immediately ob-
tained and flash-frozen until analysis. Insulin doses of 0.5 and 2 units/kg gave 
identical signaling responses. LEAF-purified anti-mouse Ly-6G antibodies, LEAF-
purified anti-mouse tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a antibodies (MP6-XT22), and 
LEAF-purified anti-mouse CD54 antibodies and their isotype control IgG anti-
bodies (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) were used for neutrophil depletion, TNF-a 
neutralization, and ICAM-1 neutralization, respectively. 
Immunoblot analysis. Epididymal fat pads were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer 
exactly as done earlier (9). Samples underwent 7.5% SDS-PAGE (for each 100-
mg sample). The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto 
a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T (TBS containing 0.1% 
Tween-20), and incubated overnight at 4°C with goat anti-mouse MPO (1:100; 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-mouse b-actin (1:10,000), 
anti-phosphorylated (p)-Ser473 Akt (1:1000), anti-Akt (1:1000), anti-p-Ser9 
glycogen synthase kinase (GSK; 1:1000), anti-GSK (1:1000), anti-cPLA 2 a 
(1:200; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX; 1:1000; Cay-
man Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), or anti-cyclogenase-2 (COX-2; 1:1000; Abcam, 
Cambridge, U.K.). After being washed with TBS-T (four washes for 15 min 
each), the membranes were incubated with 1:10,000 dilutions of the respective 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1.5 h at 
room temperature. Proteins were quantified using video densitometry analysis 
(<rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageGauge</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 4.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Fuji</rs>), as described previously (19,20). 
Preparation of neutrophils. Heart blood was withdrawn before mice were 
killed. Neutrophils, at 95% purity, were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifu-
gation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Cells were 
counted, and their viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. 
Immunohistochemistry for neutrophil detection. Epididymal fat tissues 
were embedded in paraffin and sectioned using a Leica microtome (Leica 
Biosystem, Vienna, Austria). Neutrophil staining by rat anti-mouse monoclonal 
anti-NIMP-R14 antibody to identify neutrophils (Novus Biological Inc.) was 
analyzed as done before (9,13), based on an earlier study (21). Nonspecific 
reactivity was blocked by incubating the slides with 20% normal rabbit serum 
for 20 min with avidin-biotin VECTA-STAIN Kit Elite PK 6105 (Vector Labo-
ratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then incubated in 1:10 dilution of 
anti-NIMP-R14 antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and 
further incubated with 1:200 dilution of biotinylated anti-rat IgG, followed by 
avidin-biotin complex/HRP-DAB, which resulted in brown staining of neu-
trophils. For each treatment, a negative control was prepared without the 
primary antibody. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and 
analyzed in a blinded fashion using an Olympus BX-60 microscope. </p>

<p>Following red blood cell lysis and blockade of Fc receptors with 
anti-CD16/32 antibodies, spleen cells were stained with the fol-
lowing directly conjugated antibodies: CD11b (M1/70), CD11c 
(HL3), CD86 (GL1), I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2) and H-2K 
b (AF6-
88.5) (BD Biosciences); CD8a (53-6.7), CD80 (16-10A) and 
CD19 (eBio1D3) (eBiosciences); CD45.2 (104) CD45.1 (A20), 
and CD3e (145-2C11) (BioLegend). Rabbit anti-calreticulin 
monoclonal antibody and fluorescence-labeled goat-anti-rabbit 
IgG polyclonal secondary antibody were purchased from Abcam. 
Fixable viability dyes (Invitrogen) were used to exclude dead cells. 
Flow cytometry was performed on LSRII or LSRFortessa cytome-
ters (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">FlowJo</rs> soft-
ware (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Treestar</rs>). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was 
performed using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). 
For DC isolation, spleens were injected with 1 mg/mL collage-
nase IV (Sigma), 20 mg/mL DNAse I (Roche) were incubated at 
37 
C for 15-20 min, and passed through a 70-mm filter to generate 
single cell suspensions. Cells were stained with CD3e (145-2C11) 
and CD19 (eBio1D3) biotinylated antibodies, followed by second-
ary streptavidin staining to eliminate T and B cells. </p>

<p>Grouped data were analyzed via two-way ANOVA with Bon-
ferroni post-tests. Survival differences were analyzed with the 
Log-rank test. Statistics were performed using <rs type="software">GraphPrism</rs> 
software. Data are presented as mean  § SD unless otherwise 
indicated. A p value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. </p>

<p>Renal Histology 
Renal morphology was evaluated using Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS)-stained 5-m paraf-
fin sections, based on at least 50 glomeruli per kidney section. The percentage of glomeruli 
containing microaneurysms was counted in sections from rats terminated at day 7. The Glo-
merular Sclerosis Index (GSI) was calculated as previously described [14] in sections from 
rats terminated at day 28. For the GSI, glomeruli were scored based on the percentage of the 
glomerular area that was sclerotic (normal = 0, ! 25% = 1, 25-50% = 2, 50-75% = 3, 75-
100% = 4). Renal artery wall thickness of the cortical intrarenal arteries in PAS-stained kid-
ney sections was measured using <rs id="software-0" type="software">AnalySIS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Soft Imaging Systems</rs>, Münster, 
Germany), based on lamina externa and interna diameters and using the average of at least 
five vessels per kidney section. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis 
All values are expressed as mean 8 SEM. Data were analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 11.0</rs> 
software. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Student t test, and one-or 
two-way ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis post-hoc test if appropriate. A p value ! 0.05 was con-
sidered significant. </p>

<p>compared with differently expressed genes (P # 0.01) displaying an opposite 
modulation with their corresponding miRNA. The correlation analysis be-
tween mRNA and miRNA expression was evaluated by the quantitative trait 
tool in BRB-ArrayTools (P # 0.01). 
Pathway analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 8.8</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Ingenuity Systems</rs>) as reference set and assuming direct and in-
direct relationships. Fisher exact test P value ,0.05 without multiple-testing 
correction was deemed statistically significant. 
Cell cultures. Mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared and cultured as 
previously described (28) from CD-1 mice (Harlan Laboratories, Inc.). All 
animal procedures complied with the Guidelines of the Italian National Insti-
tutes of Health and with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 
(Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy of Sciences, 
Bethesda, MD) and were approved by the institutional animal care and use 
committee. Primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), hu-
man umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Clonetics Corp.), and human 
HEK293T cell line (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as 
previously described (25). For transforming growth factor (TGF)-b stim-
ulations, HUVECs were cultured in 1% FBS endothelial basal medium (Lonza 
Group Ltd.) for 14 h and then stimulated for 48 h with 0-50 ng/mL TGF-b 
(R&amp;D Systems). For hypoxia and high glucose stimulations, cells were cul-
tured in the presence of either 25 mmol/L glucose or 5 mmol/L glucose plus 
20 mmol/L mannitol (iso-osmotic control) for 72 h. Next, they were in-
cubated in hypoxia (1.0% O 2 ) or normoxia for a further 24 h, as previously 
described (25). 
Statistics. Continuous variables are expressed as mean 6 SE. Gaussian 
distribution was tested by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For group-wise 
comparisons, Mann-Whitney test (two groups), ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test 
(n groups), or t test (two groups) were used as appropriate. For categorical 
variables, x 
2 test was used. Spearman rank correlation was used to compare 
levels of miRNAs with clinical factors. All tests were performed two-sided and 
P # 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For statistical analysis and 
heat map data visualization, <rs id="software-1" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 4.03</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">GraphPad Software Inc.</rs>.) and <rs id="software-2" type="software">Genesis</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">1.7.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Graz University of Technology, Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics</rs>) software were used, respectively. </p>

<p>Velocity encoded phase contrast sequences were 
acquired from a MR axial dataset of the aorta at the 
level of the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery 
perpendicularly transecting both the ascending and des-
cending aorta. A non-breath-hold sequence was used 
and 128 phases were captured during the cardiac 
cycle. The transit time of the propagation of the vel-
ocity waveform was calculated between the ascending 
and descending aorta using the <rs type="software">Art-FUN</rs> software with 
the least squares minimisation approach using all data 
points on the systolic upslope of the aorta flows after 
peak flow normalisation.

calculated from the double-oblique view of the thoracic 
aorta. Pulse wave velocity (m/s) was derived as aortic 
path length divided by the transit time. </p>

<p>sion applied to the training sample consisting of a random 
sample of 220 of the 325 participants. Demographic and 
clinical variables assessed in the current study included 
age, sex, intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness, 
spherical equivalent, axial length, anterior chamber depth, 
optic disc area, VF mean deviation, and pattern standard 
deviation. Factors demonstrating a significant relationship 
(a p-value less than 0.1 as determined by univariate regres-
sion analysis) were further analyzed using multiple step-
wise regression analyses. A regression model for predicting 
SD-OCT RNFL measurements was established based on 
these results. Predicted SD-OCT RNFL thickness values 
were calculated according to this formula and compared 
with the actual SD-OCT RNFL thickness measurements 
to evaluate the performance of the prediction equation. 
The regression coefficients calculated from the train-
ing sample were then applied to obtain predicted SD-OCT 
RNFL thicknesses in a separate validation sample consist-
ing of 105 participants from the total sample group of 325 
participants. Statistical analysis was performed using <rs id="software-4" type="software">SPSS</rs>

The Levene's test was applied assessing the homogeneity of 
variances for between-group comparisons. Baseline overall 
cognitive state and differences in demographics between 
groups, selected and unselected participants of the CT, and 
drop-outs and completers of the CPT were compared between 
groups. We used t-tests for independent samples to compare 
the age, Mann-Whitney tests to compare performance in 
DemTect and education, and chi-square tests for the compari-
son of the sex distribution, each with a significance level of 
α=0.05. <rs id="software-1" type="software">G*Power</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.gpower.hhu.de</rs>) was used to

After centrifuging the lysates at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 
10 minutes, the supernatants were collected and stored at 
−80°C for future use. The protein concentrations of these 
extracts were determined by performing a bicinchoninic 
acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
USA). Equal amounts of protein samples (40 µg) were sepa-
rated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels 
(SDS-PAGE) and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose 
membranes (Amersham plc, Amersham, UK). Membranes 
were blocked with 5% nonfat milk buffer and incubated with 
anti-p-p38, anti-p-p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), anti-JNK 
(1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal antibodies; Bioworld Technology,

clonal antibodies; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, 
MA, USA), and anti-β-actin (1:1,000, a mouse polyclonal 
antibody), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, 
USA) at 4°C overnight, washed with Tris-buffered saline and 
incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit 
immunoglobulin (Ig)G/antimouse IgG secondary antibody at 
37°C for 1 hour. The antibody-bound proteins were detected 
using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (EMD Mil-
lipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Quantification of the Western 
blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) data 
were performed by measuring the intensity of the band using 
the <rs id="software-3" type="software">ImageJ</rs> analysis program (Image J, <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">NIH</rs>). </p>

<p>The data were analysed using Kruskall Wallis tests for non

resistance gene (Aba resistance gene) in yeast. The 11-mer TALE-VP16 library was then transformed into this stable clone and a surviving assay was 
performed on -Leu plates containing 100 nM Aba. (b) The RVD sequences of isolated TALE-VP16 fusions and their targets within the human SCN9A bait

isolated TALE-VP16 fusions induced overexpression of endogenous SCN9A in HEK293 cells and A431 cells. The mRNA levels of SCN9A were

induce the overexpression of SCN9A in HEK293 cells (n55). Columns 11-16: All TALE-VP16 fusions effectively induced the overexpression of SCN9A in 
A431 cells (n53). Columns 7-10: All 4 TALEs designed according to <rs id="software-2" type="software">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">2.0</rs> failed to induce the overexpression of SCN9A in HEK293 cells (n53).

sequence. The isolated clone M1 was predicted to target 59-TTTCTAGGTAT-39 within the miR-34b/c bait sequence. The full-length bait sequence 
(pAbAi-miR-34b/c) or bait with the predicted target site deleted (pAbAi-miR-34b/c (DTTTCTAGGTAT)) was stably integrated into yeast cells. TALE-
VP16 fusion clone M1 was then transformed into either cell line. Only cells which contained the intact bait sequence survived the 100 nM Aba selection. 
(f) The isolated TALE-VP16 fusion M1 effectively induced overexpression of miR-34b in a dose-dependent manner in both HEK293 and HeLa cells (n53 
for both cell lines). </p>

<p>. This is a considerable 
advantage as available algorithms may not yet fully capture the 
dynamics of TALE-DNA interactions. Indeed, we designed four 
11-mer TALE-VP16 constructs for the same SCN9A bait sequence 
using the <rs id="software-4" type="software">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">2.0</rs> program (Supplementary Table 3) and 
observed that all fusions, as well as combinations, failed to induce 
the overexpression of SCN9A mRNA levels in HEK293 (Fig. 2c, 
Supplementary Figs. 7 and 9). Additional insight can be gathered

Next, the pFUS_A and pFUS_B plasmid libraries were conjoined using the standard 
protocol. Similar procedures were used to prepare the p53-responsive element-
targeting TALE-VP16 libraries. For each position of the Golden Gate Assembly 
reactions, the amounts of the four building blocks were adjusted according to the 
desired nucleotide target. All libraries were then subjected to standard Sanger 
sequencing using the forward primer P23 and the reverse primer P24 (Supplementary 
Table 1). The sequencing profiles were then analyzed using <rs type="software">FinchTV</rs> (Geospiza). For

subjected to standard Sanger sequencing using the forward primer P23 and the

TALE potential target sequences were determined by the Target Finder function of 
<rs id="software-6" type="software">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">2.0</rs> 
28 using the setting ''upstream base T''. Since TALE-NT 2.0 only 
supports sequences which are between 12 and 31 RVDs, for each TALE we conducted 
four searches by adding one additional RVD (HD or NN or NI or NG) to the end of 
our RVD sequences. The lowest score from one of these four searches was defined as 
''the lowest possible score''. The targets were considered as potentially genuine only 
when the lowest possible score is less than 9, as lower scores indicate higher 
confidence of the bindings between TALE fusions and their predicted DNA target 
sequences. </p>

<p><rs type="software">FastPval</rs>ABSTRACT </p>

<p>Motivation: Resampling methods, such as permutation and 
bootstrap, have been widely used to generate an empirical dis-
tribution for assessing the statistical significance of a measur-
ement. However, to obtain a very low P-value, a large size of 
resampling is required, where computing speed, memory and 
storage consumption become bottlenecks, and sometimes become 
impossible, even on a computer cluster. 
Results: We have developed a multiple stage P-value calculating 
program called <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> that can efficiently calculate very low (up to 
10 −9 ) P-values from a large number of resampled measurements. 
With only two input files and a few parameter settings from the 
users, the program can compute P-values from empirical distribution 
very efficiently, even on a personal computer. When tested on the 
order of 10 9 resampled data, our method only uses 52.94% the 
time used by the conventional method, implemented by standard 
quicksort and binary search algorithms, and consumes only 0.11% 
of the memory and storage. Furthermore, our method can be applied 
to extra large datasets that the conventional method fails to calculate. 
The accuracy of the method was tested on data generated from 
Normal, Poison and Gumbel distributions and was found to be no 
different from the exact ranking approach. 
Availability: The <rs id="software-2" type="software">FastPval</rs> executable file, the java GUI and source 
code, and the java web start server with example data and 
introduction, are available at <rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://wanglab.hku.hk/pvalue</rs>Permutation and bootstrap are resampling procedures to assess the 
statistical significance of a measurement. They are non-parametric 
statistical tests that can convert a measurement (score) into an 
empirical P-value, even when the distribution of the measurements is 
unknown. Since resampling does not assume known distribution of 
the data, and biological data are usually complex, it has been widely 
used in the bioinformatics field, such as transcription factor binding 
site searching, pathway analysis and genome-wide association 
studies. </p>

<p>For simplicity, here we illustrate our method in a two-stage approach and use 
the right tail of the distribution to calculate the statistics. In the first stage, we 
randomly sample a subset N from the original large dataset O. N is usually 
less than one-hundredth of the size of O, thus saving processing time. We 
sort N and obtain a cutoff score S c representing the top P portion of N. Both 
N and P are parameters specified by the users, and are set to N = 100 000 and 
P = 0.001 by the default. We then scan the original set and put scores greater 
than S c into our second subset M, and we obtain the maximum score S m in 
M. The two subsets N and M are sorted, saved, and serve as our two models 
(M1 and M2). To calculate the P-value for a new score S, we compare S 
with S c . If S ≤ S c , we will find its P-value in M1. Otherwise we use M2. If 
S &gt; S m , indicating S is out of our resampling score range, we use theoretical 
distribution to calculate its P-value or simply set the P-value to 0, at the 
user's preference. The parameters of two theoretical distributions, normal 
and extreme value distributions, were obtained from dataset N. 
To evaluate the performance of our method, we compared <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> with 
the traditional approach (named Exact) on a linux machine (Intel Xeon CPU 
E5410 2.33 GHz; 16 G of memory, SuSE linux 10.1). In the 'Exact' approach, 
we used quicksort and binary search in c programming. <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> used the 
same sorting and searching algorithms for M1 and M2. 
To evaluate the accuracy of <rs type="software">FastPval</rs>, we compared the calculated 
P-values with the original P-values in three different distributions: Normal, 
Poisson and Gumbel. For each distribution, we tested the P-values in the 
−log 10 (P-value) ranged from 0 to 9 (corresponding P-value range from 1 
to 10 −9 , exclusively). We took 162 P-values (termed theoretical P-values) 
evenly distributed in each of the nine ranges (Supplementary Table S1). 
We converted these P-values into scores with the build-in functions in the R 
platform, using parameters for each distribution as shown in Supplementary 
Table S2. Under the same parameter setting, we randomly sampled one 
billion data points. We used FastPval to build models M1 and M2 from these 
data. Finally, we used FastPval to convert these 162 scores into P-values 
(termed FastPval P-values) with the models. The −log 10 (FastPval P-values) </p>

<p>As shown in Table 1, <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> shows significant improvement over 
the 'Exact' approach. Tested on 1 billion resampling data, <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> 
only used 0.11% of the memory and storage and 52.94% of model 
building and searching times. When we increased the dataset size to 
5 billion, the 'Exact' method failed to load due to the large memory 
requirement, while our method was able to calculate P-values 
successfully. <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> has speed, memory and storage consumption 
approximately linear to resembling size. The accuracies of <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> 
calculated P-values from three different distributions were compared 
with the theoretical P-values. The results are shown in the form of 
Log-Log QQ plots (Supplementary Fig. S1a-c). In all three tested 
distributions, the <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> calculated P-values and the theoretical 
P-values are highly matched, forming a 45 degree line in the 
Log-Log QQ plots. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests showed the 
P-value = 1.000 for Normal and Poisson distributions, and 0.998 for 
Gumbel distribution, indicating that the calculated P-values did not 
deviate from the original distribution. We therefore conclude that 
<rs type="software">FastPval</rs> is accurate for calculating P-values for data from a variety 
of distributions. 
The Java GUI interface of <rs type="software">FastPval</rs> is shown in Supplementary 
Figure S2a-c. In the 'Method' field, the user can either choose 
'FastPval' or the traditional 'Exact' method to calculate P-values. 
When the resembling size is greater than 10 million, FastPval is the 
only suitable choice. In the 'Step' field, the user can either 'Generate 
model', or 'Calculate P-value' or 'Do both'. The 'Generate model' 
step allows the user to generate M1 and M2 models from the 
background dataset O; the 'Calculate P-value' step allows the user 
to calculate P-values for all the scores saved in a text file. The 
interface changes according to the user's selection. In the 'Generate 
model' step, the user has to specify the background file and directory 
to save two models, by clicking on 'Background file' and 'Output 
folder', respectively. The user also needs to select two parameters, 
the 'Sampling size' (N) and 'P-value cutoff' (P). The selections of P 
and N are affected by the balance of accuracy and speed. Bigger Ns 
and Ps will give more accurate P-values but will be less efficient. We </p>

<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood 
samples of all patients. Mutations in the GJB1 gene were 
analyzed by targeted NGS. NGS panel covered all of the exons 
and their flanking sequences of genes known to be associated 
with hereditary neuropathies (gene list available on request). 
The exons and their flanking splice sites were captured 
and subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 
Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequencing

<p>Comparative models 
Models were built for the X-fA2 C-linker and BD (211 residues, 
consisting of bCNGA1 M401-G484 followed by fCNGA2 L455-
V581) and for several constructs and mutant forms studied. Each 
target sequence was aligned to a single template of D443-L643 
from mouse HCN2 (Protein Data Bank accession no. 1Q5O; 
Zagotta et al., 2003), which was the closest relative with struc-
tural data available; there was 27% identity with three gaps intro-
duced in the template sequence. Models were built using the 
"Fit Raw Sequence" function in <rs id="software-6" type="software">DeepView</rs> <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">4.0.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Guex and Peitsch</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-date">1997</rs>) and the Project mode of SWISS-MODEL (<rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">version 8.05</rs>) (Arnold et al., 2006). Root-mean-squared distance calcula-
tions and detection of atoms within 5 Å of particular side chains

<p>Electrophysiology 
Oocytes were harvested from mature female Xenopus laevis frogs 
(procedures approved by the Canadian Council on Animal Care), 
injected with in vitro-transcribed RNA, and assayed in the excised 
inside-out patch clamp configuration, with all procedures done as 
previously reported (Young et al., 2001; Young and Krougliak, 
2004; Chan and Young, 2009). Recording conditions are briefly 
summarized: Pipette and bath solutions both contained (in mM): 
67 KCl, 30 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, and 1 EDTA, pH 7.2 with 
KOH. Na salts of cAMP or cGMP were included by iso-osmolar re-
placement of NaCl. For Ni 
2+ potentiation experiments (Young et al., 
2001), the bath solution was modified to include 10 µM NiCl 2 
(Sigma-Aldrich), omit EGTA and EDTA, and increase KCl to 89 mM. 
Current measurements were acquired at room temperature 
(19-23°C) with either an Axopatch 200B or GeneClamp500 am-
plifier, filtered at 10 kHz using the amplifier's low-pass Bessel fil-
ter, and recorded at 0.1-1 kHz by a Digidata 1322 and <rs id="software-5" type="software">pClamp</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">9.0</rs> 
software (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Axon Instruments</rs>). 
Patches were held at 40 mV, and steady-state currents in the 
presence of cyclic nucleotide were corrected by subtraction of 
leak currents in the absence of cyclic nucleotide. Spontaneous ac-
tivity changes (run-up and run-down) of CNG channels in excised 
patches were typically complete after 10-20 min, somewhat lon-
ger than previously noted for bCNGA1 (Molokanova et al., 1997). 
With the exception of specific experiments examining this run-up 
(Fig. 3 B), all reported measurements were collected after run-up 
was completed, as shown by a difference of &lt;10% among multiple 
conductance measurements in 3 mM cGMP. Steady-state conduc-
tance in 3 mM cGMP after completion of run-up was used in each 
patch to normalize conductances in other conditions, including 
those before the completion of run-up (Fig. 3 B). Unless otherwise 
noted, means are reported ± SD with n the sample size, and con-
ductance ratios were compared with unity using t test. 
For selected constructs, the P o for the 3-mM cGMP normaliza-
tion condition (after run-up) was estimated as the conductance ratio 
g (3 mM cGMP) /g (30 mM cAMP+Ni) , where the denominator is the conduc-
tance in the presence of 30 mM cAMP and 10 µM Ni 
2+ ion 
(Varnum et al., 1995; Young et al., 2001). Ratio values recorded for 
constructs in this study were as follows: Construct 2, 0.180 ± 0.050 
(n = 3); Construct 3, 0.73 ± 0.15 (n = 3); Construct 8, 0.337 ± 0.092 
(n = 4); X-fA2 V457E, 0.359 ± 0.079 (n = 4). This method as-
sumes P o ≈ 1 in the nickel-potentiated fully liganded channel and 
that unitary open-channel conductance is unaffected by either 
cyclic nucleotide or Ni 
2+ . These two assumptions were vali-
dated for previously studied X-chimeras (Young et al., 2001); all 
X-chimera sequences are identical in the transmembrane domain 
(including the pore region determining unitary conductance; 
Goulding et al., 1993) and the C-linker (including the Ni </p>

<p>sequence context, because we did not find con action in 
Construct 4. We also acknowledge the impossibility of 
confirming the criticality of V457 in all possible sequence 
contexts. Thus, conceivably, con action might be restored 
to X-fA2 V457E by some as yet untested mutations out-
side position 457. However, any such mutations would 
have to introduce amino acids not found in the fCNGA2 
BD, because X-fA2 V457E currently possesses all fCNGA2 
BD residues except V457. (This contrasts with our suc-
cessful restoration of con action to Construct 4 by adding 
back noncritical fCNGA2 BD residues to make Construct 
5). Our identification of V457 as critical for con action is 
certainly consistent with known current evidence. Of 
broader importance, the low pro-action efficacy of X-fA2 
V457E (and, more clearly, Construct 8) refutes the suffi-
ciency hypothesis. Thus, con action does not arise as an 
unavoidable consequence of the rather inefficient pro 
action in fCNGA2; rather, con action can be removed or 
added on top of a preexisting pro-action mechanism by 
virtue of the amino acid at position 457. 
Could V457 then make contact with cGMP, forming 
counterproductive interactions during con action? This 
would constitute a noncanonical cGMP-binding site that 
is structurally distinct from known sites, based on analy-
sis of our comparative models as follows. We enumerated 
"first neighbor" residues located within 5 Å of the resi-
due 457 side chain in our comparative models (Fig. 6, 
black dashed lines), and then identified "second neigh-
bor" residues within 5 Å of each of the first neighbors' 
side chains (Fig. 6, gray dashed lines). The residues of the 
"neighbor network" are limited to three noncontiguous 
helices: helix A itself, plus helix D of the C-linker, 
and helix B at the C-terminal end of the BD (second 
neighbors only). All network residues other than V457 
were conserved in all constructs of this study. Based on 
corresponding residues in the HCN2 template structure, 
none of the network residues are proximal to ligand 
bound at the canonical site. Moreover, none of them 
correspond to residues forming the previously reported 
noncanonical cAMP-binding site in Escherichia coli catab-
olite activator protein (Passner and Steitz, 1997), which 
relies on the 4-5 loop along with the DNA BD that 
has no counterpart in CNG channels. 
The neighbor network includes multiple residues 
that could contribute to ligand binding in varied ways. 
Several first neighbors are hydrophobic, suitable for in-
teraction with the entire valine side chain or with the 
C and C methylene groups of glutamate. Additionally, 
however, the salt-bridged residue pair E458+K462 is in-
cluded, available for stabilizing polar contact with the 
carboxylate group of E457 (H bonds identified by <rs type="software">VA-
DAR</rs> software; Willard et al., 2003). The effect of the 
V457E mutation could thus be a result of any of multiple 
features such as side-chain packing, charge, or specific 
H bonds, and might be as subtle as a slight reorientation 
of one of the three helices. Addressing the large scope </p>

<p>9 In practice, the center of a tract is defined by its geometric center, or "centroid." Spherical coor-
dinates of Census 2000 tract centroids were downloaded from the US Census Bureau (http://www. 
census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/places2k.html) and converted to planar coordinates using <rs type="software">ArcGIS</rs> 
software. 
10 We do not disaggregate further because the sample is small. 
11 The idea behind dividing by T cδ is the following. Suppose that tract c is distance d from tract 
k, and the travel data imply that the proportion p of the trips of those residing in tract k cover 
distance d. Residents of tract k can travel in multiple directions, and we would not expect all 
those traveling distance d to travel to tract c. Instead, we count the number of tracts that are 
distance d from tract c, which we denote T, and assume that 1/T of those who travel distance d 
will travel to tract c. In principle one could try to refine this by taking account of roads and other 
travel infrastructure. Furthermore, this is a simplification, because one would really want to do this 
calculation separately for each tract k within distance d of tract c, calculating the share of those 
from each tract k around tract c that would travel to tract c. The simplified calculation we use, 
however, will still capture the variation in potential inflow from a surrounding tract depending on 
whether tracts in the area are geographically small or geographically large. </p>

<p>offered a short break between these two sessions. The 
BIC recording session comprised a single recording run 
of approximately 30 min, whereas the IPM-FR recording 
session comprised seven 5-min records (five IPM condi-
tions and two diotic controls). Here, subjects were pre-
sented with a single repetition of each condition, in a 
random order, during a single testing session. During 
all recordings, subjects sat in a comfortable chair in an 
acoustically isolated sound booth, were encouraged to sit 
as still as possible, and watched a subtitled film. 
Responses were differentially recorded primarily from 
silver or silver chloride disc surface electrodes; the refer-
ence electrode was placed on the vertex (Cz) and the 
ground electrode was placed on the right clavicle. 
Fourteen recording electrodes were placed around the 
scalp (F3, Fz, F4, C3, C4, T9, T10, P7, P3, Pz, P4, P8, 
O1, and O2-see Figure 2). Two additional electrodes 
were placed in the left and right ear canal (gold-coated 
foam insert ear tips-Etymotic ER3-26A; Etymotic 
Research Inc., IL, USA). Electrode impedances were 
kept below 5 kV and monitored throughout the record-
ing session. Stimuli were created in <rs id="software-0" type="software">MATLAB</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">2013b</rs> and 
presented via an RME Fireface UC sound card (24 bits, 
48 kHz sampling rate; RME, Haimhausen, Germany) 
connected to Etymotic Research ER-2 insert earphones 
(Etymotic Research Inc., IL, USA). Sound level was ver-
ified with a 2-cc ear simulator (Bru¨el &amp; Kjaer 4157, </p>

(RA-16LI; Tucker-Davis Technologies, FL, USA) and 
digitized with 16 bits per sample at a rate 
of 24.414 kHz (Medusa RA16PA; Tucker-Davis 
Technologies). The cutoff frequencies of the internal 
bandpass filters were 2.2 Hz to 7.5 kHz (6 dB per 
octave). Recordings were stored on a TDT RX5 
Pentusa before being passed to the hard disk of the 
host computer via custom software. Subsequent off-line

To determine the mass concentration of each of the 
size fractions, the three Respicon Particle Sampler filters 
were post-weighed on the same digital micro-balance as 
was used to pre-weigh the filters. The calculation of dust 
concentration of each size fraction namely respirable, tho-

10 Tris-phosphocreatine and 20 U/ml creatine phosphokinase, pH 7.3 with CsOH, 
290 mOsm. The resistance of recording pipettes in extracellular solution was 3.0-
4.0 MV. The membrane potential was held at 280 mV and series resistance 
compensated by 80%. Currents were evoked by applying test pulses of 275 mV to 
1100 mV with 40-s duration and an increment of 5 mV at 10-s intervals. The cell 
capacitance (32 6 12 pF) and series resistance (,20 MV) were monitored 
throughout the recording. Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. The 
leak currents were corrected using the online P/6 trace subtraction. </p>

neurons were incubated with 2 mM Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (Life Technologies) 
in DMEM culture medium at 37uC for 30 min, followed by washing three times with 
phosphate buffer saline. Cells bathed in MEM with 2% FBS were placed on the stage of 
an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a Xenon illumination system 
and an IMAGO CCD camera (Till Photonics, Germany). The fluorescence, excited 
alternatively with 340 nm and 380 nm and emitted at 510 nm, were recorded, stored

tracted from cultured HPCs and primary hepatocytes 
using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) fol-
lowing the manufacturer's protocol. Single-and dou-
ble-stranded cDNA was synthesized from qualified 
total RNA samples using the GeneChip 3' IVT Express 
Kit (Affymetrix). Three samples of total RNA (200 ng) 
pooled from five different specimens of each cell type 
were used for cDNA synthesis. After double-stranded 
cDNA cleanup and a quality check, in vitro transcrip-
tion was performed using the GeneChip IVT Labeling 
Kit (Affymetrix) to produce biotin-labeled cRNA from 
the cDNA. The Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays 
were hybridized at 45 °C for 16 h at 60 rpm with a 
hybridization cocktail containing 15 µg of fragmented 
and labeled cRNA in a hybridization oven (Affymet-
rix). The arrays were then washed and stained with 
streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SAPE, Molecular Probes, 
OR, USA). All hybridization assay methods, including 
the preparation of solutions, were performed accord-
ing to the manufacturers' instructions. The distribu-

Bootstrapping is used as well to confirm the significance of 
mediations exhibited in the model regardless of normality 
of our data (Byrne 2010). We use the following statistics in 
testing the goodness of fit: Chi square (c²) (Bollen 1989); 
normed fit index (NFI) (Bentler, Bonett 1980); comparative 
fit index (CFI) (Bentler 1990); root mean square residual 
(RMR) (Hu, Bentler 1995); and root mean square error of 
approximation (RMSEA) (Browne, Cudeck 1993). Those 
statistics will help to test for how good the model is in fit 
ting the collected data. 
Table 5 shows the results of the proposed model test 
ing. The values of RMR (0.036 &lt; 0.05) (Hu, Bentler 1995), 
CFI (0.958 &gt; 0.9) (Bentler 1990), and NFI (0.942 &gt; 0.9) 
(Bentler, Bonett 1980) indicate a good fit for the proposed 
model. However, RMSEA (0.88 &gt; 0.08) demonstrates a poor 
fit of the proposed model for our data (Jöreskog, Sörbom 
1989) -besides there are three insignificant paths: Social 
Role → Attitude (pvalue = 0.281 &gt; 0.05), Materialism → 
Attitude (pvalue = 0.218 &gt; 0.05), and Falsity → Attitude 
(pvalue = 0.176 &gt; 0.05). Therefore, our model needs to be 
revised, and then retested. <rs type="software">AMOS</rs> suggests adding two new

were analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">FlowJo</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">TreeStar</rs>, Ashland, OR). </p>

<p>Statistics: Arithmetic mean and standard deviation were used to 
present data. One-way ANOVA and Tukey test for multiple comparisons 
were conducted with Optical Density (OD) readings of sera from 
infected and treated mice from different groups, and two-way ANOVA 
and Bonferroni post test were used to compare larval recovery in tissues 
using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Prisma</rs> program, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 5.0</rs>. Differences were considered to

were then denatured at 95 
C for 10 min and polymer-
ization products were separated from substrates by 
denaturing gel electrophoresis using 14% acryl-
amide gels containing 7 M urea. DNA synthesis was 
analyzed by phosphorimaging using a GS-525 
Molecular Imager and <rs id="software-0" type="software">Quantity One Software</rs>

(ii) Inhibition of HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis was also 
evaluated to determine IC 50 values using a 
5 
0 -end-
32 P-labeled 19-nt DNA primer (5 
0 -TTGTAG 
CACCATCCAAAGG-3 
0 ) that was annealed to one </p>

<p>of three 36-nt DNA templates that contained five 
consecutive thymine, cytosine or adenosine bases. 
In this regard, inhibition of HIV-1 RT DNA syn-
thesis by analogs with adenine, guanine or thymine 
bases were evaluated using the templates (T1, 5 
0 -CA 
GACTTTTTCAGACCTTTGGATGGTGCTACA 
AGCT-3 
0 ), (T2, 5 
0 -CAGAGCCCCCGAGACCTTT 
GGATGGTGCTACAAGCT-3 
0 ), or (T3, 5 
0 -CTGC 
TAAAAACTGCCCTTTGGATGGTGCTACAAG 
CT-3 
0 ), respectively. The T1 template was used for 
inhibition of WT and mutant HIV-1 RT DNA syn-
thesis by each of the 6-modified-3 
0 -azido-ddGTP 
analogs. Reaction conditions and gel electrophoresis 
were identical to those described above except 
100 nM of WT or mutant HIV-1 RT was used to 
initiate the reaction. Reactions were quenched fol-
lowing incubation at 37 
C for 10 min. The amount 
of final product on the denaturing polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels was quantified by 
densiometric analysis using <rs type="software">Quantity One</rs> Software. 
The concentration of each 6-modified-3 
0 -azido-
ddGTP analog required to inhibit the formation of 
final product by 50% was calculated using non-
linear regression analyses (<rs id="software-2" type="software">SigmaPlot Software</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">Version 11</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA.</rs>) from at least three independent experiments. 
Two-tailed homoscedastic t-tests were used to calcu-
late the reported P-values. </p>

<p>A rapid quench instrument (Kintek RQF-3 instrument, 
Kintek Corporation, Clarence, PA, USA) was used for 
pre-steady-state experiments. The typical experiment was 
performed at 37 
C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) contain-
ing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 and varying concentra-
tions of nucleotide. All concentrations reported refer to 
the final concentrations after mixing. HIV-1 RT 
(200 nM) was pre-incubated with 20 nM T/P substrate, 
prior to rapid mixing with nucleotide and divalent metal 
ions to initiate the reaction that was quenched with 50 mM 
EDTA. The sequences of the template and 5 
0 -radiolabeled 
primer are shown in Table 1. The quenched samples were 
then mixed with an equal volume of gel loading buffer and 
products were separated from substrates as described 
above. The disappearance of substrate (20mer) and the 
formation of product (21-mer) were quantified using a 
Bio-Rad GS525 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 
Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Data were fitted by nonlinear 
regression with <rs id="software-3" type="software">Sigma Plot software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA.</rs>) using the appropriate equa-
tions (9). The apparent burst rate constant (k obs ) for 
each particular concentration of dNTP was determined 
by fitting the time courses for the formation of prod-
uct (21mer) using the following equation: [21mer] = 
A[1 À exp(Àk obs t)], where A represents the burst ampli-
tude. The turnover number (k pol ) and apparent dissoci-
ation constant for dNTP (K d ) were then obtained by 
plotting the apparent catalytic rates (k obs ) against dNTP </p>

<p>Molecular models of incorporation were constructed using 
the X-ray crystallographic coordinates (PDB entry 1 
RTD) for the RT-T/P-TTP ternary complex (10). The 
3 
0 -OH of the primer strand as well as the 6-modified-
3 
0 -azido-2 
0 ,3-ddGTP analogs and complementary bases 
in the template strand were built into the model to 
generate a pre-initiation complex, as described previously 
(11). Tautomerization and protonation potential of the 
entire system was calculated using the Generalized 
Born/Volume Integral (GB/VI) electrostatics method of 
Labute (12). Energy gradient minimization was carried 
out using MMFF94x force field in the Molecular 
Operating Environment (MOE 2008.02; Chemical 
Computing Group, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Ligand 
interactions were quantified and images generated using 
the LigX interaction function in MOE. Structural 
models comparing incorporation and excision of specific 
nucleotide analogs used the PDB co-ordinates 3KLF and 
3KLE that contain the excision product AZT adenosine 
dinucleoside tetraphosphate (AZTppppA) (13). To elimin-
ate the potential force field bias from alignment of bases, 
empirically derived angle relations were used for all analogs 
tested. 3KLF and 3KLE were fit to the p66 subunit of 
1RTD using the Matchmaker function in <rs id="software-4" type="software">Chimera</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 1.51</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">UCSF Chimera, Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco.</rs>). Aligned structures 
were opened in MOE and dihedral angles were measured 
from bases relative to the ribose ring O and C1 of both 
template and bound nucleotides for each complex. 
MOE's builder function was used to modify each 
template/bound nucleotide base pair retaining the experi-
mental dihedrals. Hydrogen-bonding potential between the 
aligned base pairs was quantified using the 'FindHBond' 
function in <rs type="software">Chimera</rs> with default settings. Parts of 
modeling workflow was automated using <rs id="software-6" type="software">Pipeline Pilot</rs>

<p>Prevalence was estimated for HIV, HBV, HCV, HSV-2 and syph-
ilis. Exact binomial or binomial 95% CIs were calculated for 
prevalence estimates. Characteristics were compared by registra-
tion status using χ 
2 or Fisher's exact test for categorical vari-
ables and t test or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. 
Prevalence ORs were estimated in a univariate analysis. 
Characteristics associated with syphilis in a univariate analysis 
( p&lt;0.20) were evaluated for correlation and entered in a multi-
variate logistic regression model. Characteristics that were not 
statistically significant ( p&lt;0.05) in the multivariate model 
were removed in a stepwise manner, and independent associ-
ation with syphilis was assessed after adjustment for other 
variables retained in the model. Double data entry for all ques-
tionnaire and laboratory data were conducted at the ICGES. All 
data management and analyses were conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.9.2</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc</rs>, Cary, North Carolina, USA). </p>

<p>Genomic DNA samples were quantified using the QuantiFluor 
dsDNA system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to 
manufacturer's instructions. Whole-exome capture was per-
formed on 50 ng DNA using the Nextera Rapid Capture 
Expanded Exome kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and 125-
bp paired-end sequences were obtained on a HiSeq2500 
platform (Illumina), according to manufacturer's instructions. 
Details of WES analysis are described elsewhere.

Wherever possible, additional familial samples not subject-
ed to WES were included for validation of candidate variants by 
Sanger Sequencing on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied

Finally, validated variants were checked for MAF in the African

<p>An area within 5 mm of the echogenic endometrial 
border was identified and the histogram and the 
virtual organ computer aided analysis (VOCAL) 
were used to measure the sub-endometrial vascu-

and controls was calculated by Welch t tests, and the exact test 
was used to determine whether the SNPs departed from the 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The association between 
the minor allele and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH was 
evaluated by Pearson x

each genotype and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH, 5 models 
were used, including the codominant, dominant, recessive,

<p>In total, 31,653 EST-SSR loci were identifi ed in the transcriptome sequence 
data from the related species P. tabuliformis (SRA accession: SRA056887, 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). The sequences were analyzed for potential 
SSRs using Simple Sequence Repeat Identifi cation Tool (<rs id="software-1" type="software">SSRIT</rs>) software 
( Temnykh et al., 2001 ; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.gramene.org/db/markers/ssrtool</rs>/ ). A set of 
702 SSRs was identifi ed that met a requirement for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, 
and hexanucleotide sequences with a minimum of 12, 6, 5, 5, 5, and 5 repeats, 
respectively. Among these, 175 SSRs were selected randomly for primer de-
sign, excluding the SSRs located at the loci termini. Primer pairs were designed 
using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Primer Premier</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">5.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">PREMIER Biosoft International</rs>, Palo Alto, 
California, USA) ( Wei et al., 2012 ) with the following criteria: primer lengths 
of 16-22 bp, GC content of 40-65%, annealing temperature ( T a ) ranging from 
40 ° C to 60 ° C, and a predicted PCR product size ranging from 100 to 500 bp. 
Genomic DNA samples were isolated from the needles of 48 P . sylvestris 
var. mongolica plants using the advanced cetyltrimethylammonium bromide </p>

<p>The SSR fragment sizes were estimated by comparison with DNA marker I 
(Aidlab Co. Ltd.). 
One hundred seventy-fi ve EST-SSR primer pairs were synthesized (Shanghai 
Sangon Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). Fifty-six primer pairs were identifi ed that 
yielded stable, clear, and repeatable amplicons in P . sylvestris var. mongolica . 
The other primer pairs were unstable or gave no product. The 56 primers corre-
sponded to 31 loci that were monomorphic (data not shown) and 25 loci that were 
polymorphic ( Table 1 ). The polymorphic SSR loci were analyzed with POP-
GENE <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">version 1.32</rs> software ( Yeh et al., 1999 ) for the number of alleles per locus 
( A ), observed heterozygosity ( H o ), expected heterozygosity ( H e ), and fi xation in-
dex ( F IS ). Detailed data are shown in Table 2 . The A values ranged from two to 
eight with a mean of 3.12. The H o and H e values were 0.0435-0.8125 and 0.0430-
0.7820 with averages of 0.3412 and 0.4027, respectively. The F IS values ranged 
from -0.2877 to 0.6773 with an average of 0.1175. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
(HWE) and linkage disequilibrium using Bonferroni correction were tested for 
every locus. The following loci deviated signifi cantly ( P &lt; 0.002) from HWE: </p>

<p>lw_isotig27940, lw_isotig02138, lw_isotig04931, lw_isotig02842, lw_isotig11166, 
and lw_isotig12667. No linkage disequilibrium ( P &lt; 0.002) was detected among 
any loci. 
To identify potential functions of the 25 SSR-associated unigenes, the se-
quences were aligned with the GenBank database using the BLASTX program 
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) ( Yang et al., 2012 ). The E -value was 
limited to 0-1.0E -5 . Gene Ontology (GO) was also used to predict functions of 
the unigenes (http://geneontology.org/). Eighteen sequences were found to 
have potential functions by <rs type="software">BLASTX</rs> or <rs type="software">GO</rs> analysis . These sequences showed 
signifi cant homology to protein sequences from Picea sitchensis (Bong.) 
Carrière, Picea glauca Voss, Selaginella moellendorffi i Hieron., Vitis vinifera 
L., Cucumis sativus L., and Zea mays L. The potential functions were mainly 
related to ionic bonding, oxidation-reduction processes, and feedback regula-
tion ( Table 3 ). </p>

<p>Meta-analyses were used to synthesize RCT evidence for the 
direct comparisons, and NMAs were conducted to estimate 
relative effectiveness (as rate ratios) and credible intervals 
(CrIs) across all treatments for each outcome. Poisson mod-
els were used to adjust for possible differences in duration 
of follow-up between treatments and multiple outcomes per 
patient. A hierarchical Bayesian approach was followed, 
and models were fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo 
simulations. 
15 Data were analyzed using fixed-and random-
effect models, and prior distributions for each parameter of 
interest were assumed. For relative-effectiveness estimates, 
a vague normal prior probability (n 0,1,000 ) was assumed. 
For the random-effect model, a γ-distribution (γ 0.001 ) was 
used as a prior for the precision (inverse of the variance) 
parameter. The decision to use either a random-effect or 
fixed-effect model was based on clinical considerations, 
model convergence, and goodness of fit, as measured by 
the deviance information criterion. Studies with no events 
in any arm for a particular outcome were excluded from 
that outcome's network of studies. All models were run 
until convergence was reached. Convergence was assessed 
through inspection of trace plots, consideration of potential 
scale-reduction factors, and inspection of multiple chains 
with different initial values. 
Consistency, a key assumption underlying NMAs, 
requires that any differences between direct and indirect esti-
mates are due to chance. 
11 Consistency was assessed through 
the inspection of coherence plots. 
16 Evidence of inconsistency 
was observed when CrIs around relative-effectiveness esti-
mates did not cross 1. All analyses were performed using 
R version 2.14.1 statistical software (R Development Core 
Team, Vienna, Austria) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">WinBUGS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 1.4</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">MRC Biostatistics Unit</rs>, Cambridge, UK). 
Interventions were compared based on the following out-
comes: all strokes, ischemic stroke, MI, major bleeding, ICH,

<p>Motivation: For the biologist, running bioinformatics analyses 
involves a time-consuming management of data and tools. <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs><rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs><rs id="software-23" type="software">Mobyle</rs><rs corresp="#software-23" type="url">http://bioweb2.pasteur.fr/ projects/mobyle</rs><rs id="software-24" type="software">PlayMOBY</rs><rs corresp="#software-24" type="url">http://lipm-bioinfo.toulouse.inra.fr/biomoby/PlayMOBY</rs>Over the last 10 years, an increasing number of bioinformatics tools, 
covering a growing spectrum of applications, including aspects of 
genomics, systems and structural biology have been made available 
to the community. The complexity of analyses undertaken in these 
domains makes the publication, integration and interconnection of 
these tools particularly challenging. 
Several systems propose a solution to automate the access to 
bioinformatics resources. Web-based user interfaces, such as the 
<rs id="software-25" type="software">Biology Workbench</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-25" type="creator">Subramaniam</rs>, 1998), <rs id="software-36" type="software">PISE</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-36" type="creator">Letondal</rs>, 2001), 
<rs type="software">wEMBOSS</rs> (Sarachu and Colet, 2005), <rs type="software">Galaxy</rs> (Giardine et al., 
2005), <rs type="software">GenePattern</rs> (Reich et al., 2006), <rs type="software">MOWServ</rs> (Navas-Delgado 
et al., 2006), the <rs type="software">New Generation Biology Workbench</rs> (Rifaieh 
et al., 2007), <rs type="software">BioManager</rs> (Cattley and Arthur, 2007) and <rs type="software">BioExtract</rs> 
(Lushbough et al., 2008), simplify the access to powerful computer 
resources by providing a familiar graphical-based environment for 
inexperienced users and by saving them from installing software on 
their own computer. In contrast with these tools which focus on the 
execution of programs, and where the users can often interactively 
chain analyses, <rs id="software-50" type="software">GBrowse MOBY</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-50" type="creator">Wilkinson</rs>, 2006) and <rs type="software">Seahawk</rs> 
(Gordon and Sensen, 2007b) propose data-centric solutions where 
the user can explore a set of BioMOBY (Wilkinson, 2004) services to 
analyse a set of given data, with edition, navigation and visualization 
components which fully exploit the composite nature of BioMOBY 
objects. 
Standalone workflow systems such as Taverna (Oinn et al., 2004), 
Kepler (Altintas et al., 2004) or BioSide (Hallard et al., 2004) enable 
to combine tools within desktop applications, using graphically 
specified workflows. It is hence possible, for bioinformaticians, to 
organize and automate complex data processing. Such possibilities 
have also been offered on web interfaces, either in dedicated systems 
such as <rs type="software">Remora</rs> (Carrere and Gouzy, 2006), or within some of the 
web-based systems cited above. <rs type="software">PISE</rs>, <rs type="software">Galaxy</rs> and <rs type="software">BioExtract</rs> also 
offer the possibility to save interactively designed protocols. 
Many of these systems now offer the possibility of accessing 
distributed resources, often using dedicated web-service solutions 
such as BioMOBY and SoapLab (Senger et al., 2003). While 
SoapLab offers a system to automate the distribution of 
asynchronous analytical services, the BioMOBY protocol provides 
in addition more detailed descriptions, including semantic metadata 
and a registration system to facilitate the discovery of relevant 
resources. A number of tools facilitates the publication and </p>

<p>management of BioMOBY services, such as <rs id="software-60" type="software">MoSeS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-60" type="url">http:// biomoby.open-bio.org/CVS_CONTENT/moby-live/Java/docs/ Moses-generators.html</rs>) and the BioMOBY dashboard (http:// 
biomoby.open-bio.org/CVS_CONTENT/moby-live/Java/docs/ 
Dashboard.html). Many of the existing user interfaces rely on the 
descriptions provided by these systems to generate user interfaces: 
Ajax Command Definition from EMBOSS (Rice et al., 2000), 
BioMOBY or even pure WSDL definitions. 
<rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> is a generic web-based framework. While including 
advanced technologies such as web services, remote execution and 
dataflow mechanisms, it addresses major end-user concerns arising 
from the use of sophisticated bioinformatics systems. A recent study 
(Gordon and Sensen, 2007a) shows how simple issues in the user 
interface can impede the use of a system by scientists, causing them 
to waste time and even preventing them from using it further. To 
address this issue, the design of <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs>'s interface is user-centered, 
to provide a usable yet customizable access to a large panel of 
services, from genome analysis to structural bioinformatics. The 
description language it uses to generate user interfaces is sufficiently 
extensive and flexible for rich user interfaces to be generated. Its 
core partly relies on concepts previously embedded in PISE and 
the RPBS portal (Alland et al., 2005). Moreover, different Mobyle 
servers can be federated to integrate services distributed over various 
sites. This functionality enables the federation of a network of 
curated portals, combining the skills of each of them. The <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> 
program description language also enables to define web services, as 
shown by the <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> Mobyle companion tool, which automates 
the publication of BioMOBY web services, and has monitoring 
capabilities that provide the bases for service quality monitoring. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> design process was based on a user-centered design 
process (Javahery et al., 2004; Letondal and Amanatian, 2004; 
Shachak et al., 2007), involving numerous interviews and a number 
of users workshops (see Section 4.1). We identified the major 
end-user concerns that needed to be addressed: </p>

<p>In this section, we provide an overview of <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs>. We describe 
the underlying concepts of the system, the design of the web user 
interface, the server components and the distributed architecture. </p>

<p>3.1.2 Persistent user workspaces One of the shortcomings of 
the <rs id="software-69" type="software">PISE</rs> environment is its lack of support for a persistent user 
workspace (<rs corresp="#software-69" type="creator">Gilbert</rs>, 2002). The new system, while still allowing a 
fast and temporary 'guest' access to the programs, also gives to the 
users the possibility to create registered accounts, which allows user 
data and jobs to be maintained and managed across multiple work 
sessions. </p>

<p>3.1.3 XML description of interfaces Based on feedback from 
<rs type="software">PISE</rs> server administrators, as well as the need to extend the 
capacity of functionalities such as web service wrapping or workflow 
management, we modified the schema that describes the system. 
All <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> data, including program descriptions, job definitions 
and user workspaces are stored in XML documents. The main 
element of the system, the program description, is inherited from 
the PISE system. It describes various aspects, in a language that 
targets simplicity as much as possible (experience shows that the 
authoring and maintenance of program descriptions is a complex 
and tedious task). Aspects covered include: </p>

<p>• BioMoby integration: the XML files can be enriched with 
metadata such as BioMoby parameter types, which permits 
the publication of a program as a BioMoby service using 
<rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> (see Section 3.6). </p>

<p>A formal description of the XML grammar used to describe 
<rs id="software-73" type="software">Mobyle</rs> programs is available on the project webpage (see <rs corresp="#software-73" type="url">http://bioweb2.pasteur.fr/projects/mobyle/downloads.html</rs>), using Relax 
NG (Clark et al., 2001). </p>

<p>3.1.4 Network-enabled bioinformatics tools The <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> system 
aims at acting as a 'hub' for a set of programs of interest. A program 
integrated in Mobyle can not only be local but also remote, using 
the Mobyle Net functionality (further described in Section 3.5). 
Additionally, current and future developments aim at providing 
gateways to web-service-based systems such as BioMOBY (see 
Section 3.6). The interest is to provide a unified framework for 
bioinformatics platforms maintainers, who have to publish and 
integrate various local or remote programs for both biologists and 
bioinformaticians. </p>

<p><rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> provides the scientist with a global and integrated view of 
all the elements needed to perform his or her analyses. At one glance, 
the user can see which programs are available and which analyses 
have already been run. The portal is organized in three main parts 
(Fig. 1): a left navigation panel, a central panel displaying a selection 
of elements of the current work, such as forms and results, and 
horizontal tabs enabling the user to navigate between these elements. </p>

<p>A major aspect of <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> is its capacity to facilitates automated 
data conversion and formatting for service integration, thus saving 
the user from tedious and non-scientific data manipulation tasks. The 
<rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> typing system describes program parameters using a typing 
mechanism that aims to help users in such tasks. It modifies the 
interface display, the controls for user values (the input parameters), 
the possibility of chaining between programs and data reusability. 
Similarly to <rs id="software-80" type="software">SWAMI</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-80" type="creator">Rifaieh</rs> et al., 2007), data and parameter 
characterization is multidimensional: </p>

<p>In contrast with other typing systems, such as the one offered by 
BioMOBY, the parameter compatibility between two tasks is based 
on a more abstract description. Since the <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> system can convert 
the data to the format which is accepted by the next task, there is 
no need to have service interoperability rely on a bioinformatics 
format description. For instance, in the <rs type="software">Mobyle Pasteur</rs> server, </p>

<p>the user can align a set of protein sequences using the clustalw-
multialign interface, then pipe the clustalw-formatted result to 
<rs type="software">Phylip</rs> protdist: although this program only accepts <rs type="software">Phylip</rs>-formatted 
multiple alignments, the <rs type="software">squizz</rs> program, which handles sequence 
and alignment conversions, will automatically detect and convert 
the multiple alignment into the accepted format. This approach 
simplifies the construction of the protocol: the user does not have to 
specify data transformation tasks, allowing optimal handling of the 
data (the format conversion information is directly accessible in the 
job result page). This typing system is configurable and relies on a 
'best-effort' approach. Tasks such as format detection or conversion 
are handled by the system only if they are compatible with the local 
configuration. 
This feature underlies the difference in what is considered to 
be a 'service' between <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> and BioMOBY: in Mobyle, data 
format conversions should be, as far as possible, considered as mere 
connectors in the analysis dataflow, whereas in BioMOBY they 
are considered to be on the same level as other analysis programs. 
Furthermore, since some programs accept multiple data formats as 
inputs, publishing them in BioMOBY involves registering multiple 
services on the registry (one per accepted format), whereas they are 
published as a single 'interface' in <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs>. </p>

<p>The Web portal provides a unified access to the services available 
on the server which is briefly described on Figure 3. We use Ajax 
(Garrett, 2005) to coordinate required information and to enable the 
user to explore various functionalities on a single page. For instance, 
a user action such as a job submission triggers an update of the user's 
job list and the data bookmarks list. This event triggers an update 
of the history data available in the program forms, without the page 
having to be completely reloaded. 
The <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> server, based on a set of python modules, handles 
the various aspects of job, data and session managements. The most 
important of these, job submission, includes: </p>

<p>Fig. 4. <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> network architecture. The Mobyle server can invoke either 
local or remote programs, integrating them in a single work environment. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> network allows the execution of programs that are 
available on different Mobyle servers from a single portal. This 
feature facilitates user access to services physically distributed over 
different <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> servers, within an integrated environment enabling 
data reuse and program chaining. As opposed to BioMOBY, <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> 
does not provide any central repository to register new services, 
relying instead on a distributed registration: each Mobyle server 
administrator chooses to publish a number of services, which can 
be upon his choice exported to or imported from remote Mobyle 
servers. Remote program invocation relies on the import of the 
remote program XML descriptions. Upon submission, this allows 
to generate a call to the remote server instead of generating and 
submitting a local batch call. In such a configuration, the user 
workspace, as well as the local jobs, remain stored on the initial 
server, but remotely invoked jobs are directly linked from their 
execution servers (Fig. 4). 
We demonstrate the use of this facility for the easy comparative 
modelling of the structure of a protein identified from analysis 
of the sunflower genome. A step by step tutorial is available on 
the MobyleNet help pages (http://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/ 
help/MobyleTutorials_network.html). This task can be broken down 
into several successive steps: inferring protein sequence from the 
genomic information, performing a search for a template structure, 
fitting the query sequence to the template and then generating a 
3D model. Protein sequence inference can currently be performed 
through the <rs type="software">LIPM Mobyle</rs> server, using the heliagene resource 
dedicated to sunflower genomic information. The next steps can 
be achieved through the <rs type="software">RPBS Mobyle</rs> server using a two pass blast 
(PDBblast service) to identify candidate template structures from 
the query sequence. Sequence alignment can be performed through 
the <rs type="software">Institut Pasteur Mobyle</rs> server using the clustalw service. Finally, 
the 3D modelling and model visualization/analysis can be performed 
through the <rs type="software">RPBS</rs> site (Fig. 2). The <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> network allows efficient 
organization of the complete sequence of tasks as a pipeline, without 
having to leave the <rs type="software">RPBS Mobyle</rs> portal, but making use of the 
resources and services at the three sites. </p>

<p>3.6 Deploying BioMOBY services from <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> 
program descriptions, using <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> </p>

<p><rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> is an external <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> companion tool allows 
the publication of BioMOBY-compliant web services, using 
Mobyle program descriptions. From the same XML description, 
bioinformatics programs can thus be both published on the 
<rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> network and used by the code generator of PlayMOBY 
in order to implement, register and validate BioMOBY web 
services automatically. <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> also integrates a perl library 
to generate the corresponding <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> XML description file from 
program parameters. Thus, <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> reduces the overheads 
of publishing BioMOBY web services. To date, <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> 
handles more than 100 BioMOBY web services for providing 
generic sequence analysis tools and ensuring the interoperability of 
specialized databases (http://www.legoo.org, http://www.heliagene 
.org and http://narcisse.toulouse.inra.fr). 
In addition to web service deployment, <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> provides 
daily monitoring tools for the deployed web services. During the 
<rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> to <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> format conversion step, a service developer 
can provide a test dataset for each service input. These data are used 
to test web services availability and consistency by the provider 
himself. We made the choice to not allow web services users 
to launch these tests, which are instead automatically launched. 
The tests consist in verifying accessibility to the web service and 
consistency and stability of the results on test data. Their results 
are published as XML reports and RSS feeds. The <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> 
description for the QoS presently follows the specifications stated 
by the <rs type="software">BioWorkflow</rs> group (Wessner et al., 2008). However, it could 
easily be extended to other frameworks such as the <rs type="software">BioCatalogue</rs> 
project (Belhajjame et al., 2008). In the case of failures or 
unexpected results, alerts are sent by e-mail to the developers. Thus, 
<rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> also provides the framework to evaluate <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> service 
reliability and curation. This problem is particularly important in 
bioinformatics, given the volatility of tools (especially web-based), 
impairing the reliability of biological data processing. </p>

<p>sessions. We used the think-aloud method (Nielsen, 1994), involving 
users working in pair. Participants were told they could bring their 
own data. Most of them tried 2D structure analysis, alignment and 
phylogenetic programs. Several users perceived the new system 
as more complex, but more complete than the current one. They 
appreciated being able to retrieve jobs results, particularly from the 
databox menus. Most of the concerns, which were consequently 
solved, were related to (i) having to navigate back and forth between 
forms and results; (ii) user accounting; (iii) not fully understanding 
some English terms (such as 'pairwise' alignment) used in program 
classification; and (iv) ambiguities concerning data storage. 
The <rs type="software">Institut Pasteur</rs>, <rs type="software">RPBS</rs> and <rs type="software">LIPM</rs> Mobyle servers have been 
publicly available since January 2008, October 2008 and January 
2009, respectively. The Pasteur server provides access to a wide 
range of bioinformatics tools mainly focused on sequence analysis 
and phylogeny; the <rs type="software">LIPM</rs> server offers access to tools related to 
plant genomics; and the <rs type="software">RPBS</rs> server publishes programs that mainly 
concern structural bioinformatics. Over 400 000 jobs have already 
been submitted by over 40 000 different users throughout the world 
on these servers. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> project arose from the natural evolution of software 
such as <rs type="software">PISE</rs>, offering a simple way to publish and to share 
bioinformatics software on the Web. Program chaining is limited 
to the most common usage patterns that we identified, and does 
not provide any of the advanced workflow patterns included in 
previously described systems (<rs type="software">Taverna</rs>, <rs type="software">Kepler</rs>). It is not either 
intended to handle analyses of very large quantities of data, 
data transfer over the network being too costly for web-based 
applications. 
Several aspects make this approach novel: </p>

<p>• the <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> network enables the integration of local software 
with remote services, reducing the costs associated with 
the local maintenance of an exhaustive list of programs. 
Application of this strategy over several <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> sites should 
help to connect providers, generating a framework that 
emcompasses a wide spectrum of applications and covers 
complementary aspects of bioinformatics. This strategy needs 
to be tested for a large number of sites; however, we anticipate 
the generation of a confidence network combining specific 
tools offered by each platform and thus promoting quality 
management of the services. </p>

<p>• deployment of BioMOBY web services from bioinformatics 
programs is made available through <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs>. It thus benefits </p>

<p>Workflows and protocols: <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> already embeds a prototype 
dataflow-oriented workflow engine, enabling the chaining of 
successive or parallel tasks to be automated. It runs on top of the 
<rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> core library, exploiting the Mobyle network to execute tasks 
distributed between local and remote servers, and orchestrates the 
tasks to synchronize their execution with the availability of all their 
input data. 
<rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> workflows modelize a set of tasks, but in contrast with 
existing workflow languages such as SCUFL in <rs type="software">Taverna</rs> (Oinn 
et al., 2004) or MoML in <rs type="software">Kepler</rs> (Altintas et al., 2004), do 
not specify explicitly some low-level data format detection and 
transformation tasks. Authors are, whenever possible according 
to local configuration, not asked to specify these steps. Hence, 
the storage of workflow definitions is planned to be based on 
an extension of the current <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> XML language, as they are 
based on a higher level perspective on the analyses they describe. 
An interesting outcome is the possibility to save an interactively 
designed program chaining as a reusable composite service. This 
perspective provides a gateway towards the publication of user-
acknowledged protocols on a community-based platform such as 
myexperiment.org (De Roure et al., 2007). Future end-user access 
to the workflow definitions and workflow engine will be integrated 
to the current web interface. 
Web services: the <rs type="software">PlayMOBY</rs> system already allows the 
automated publication of BioMOBY web services using <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> 
program definitions. Future work also includes enabling the use 
of other approaches such as custom SOAP or REST interfaces, 
and <rs type="software">SoapLab</rs>. Enabling the integration of such services as remote 
programs, for which the Mobyle Web Portal acts as a client will also 
be considered. 
Didactic tutorials: further developments will encompass the 
design of tutorials. As explained by Cattley and Arthur (2007), 
integrated web portals are a very efficient learning and teaching tool. 
<rs type="software">Mobyle</rs> additionally provides technical support for implementing 
interactive tutorials. A major issue to be incorporated in its design is 
to make more interactive components available: as shown by user 
studies, workflows should be available as semi-automatic protocols, 
with interactive components enabling the biologist to customize the 
visualization of the result from an analysis (e.g. a 3D molecule or 
an alignment). </p>

<p>The design of <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs>, which provides an effective way to 
make a large panel of curated bioinformatics tools available in 
a homogeneous environment, has been driven with the concern 
to meet the requirements of different audiences-biologists and 
bioinformaticians, mostly. Our objective was thus to facilitate the 
access to complex features and advanced technologies by a design </p>

<p>For retention trials that randomised individuals and clusters, the 
unit of analysis was the participant. For cluster randomised trials 
that ignored clustering in the analysis, we inflated the standard 
errors (SE) to avoid overprecise estimates of effect as follows ( 
Higgins 2008b). 
1. We calculated the RR, 95% CI and SE based on 
participants in the usual way (i.e. ignoring clustering). 
2. This standard error was then inflated using the design effect 
to get an adjusted SE: adjusted SE = SE X 
√ 
design effect. With 
the design effect calculated as follows: design effect = 1 + (M -1) 
ICC where M = mean cluster size, ICC = the intracluster 
correlation coefficient. 
3. Where published ICCs were not available, we used the 
mean ICC from appropriate external estimates for Land 2007. 
This was the mean of estimates for the return of EuroQol 
questionnaires (ICC = 0.054) from a source recommended by 
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 
(Section 16.3.4) (Higgins 2008b) and www.abdn.ac.uk/hsru/ 
documents/iccs-web.xls (last accessed 27 September 2013). 
4. We entered the effect estimate and the new updated SE into 
Review Manager <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5</rs> using the generic inverse variance (RevMan 
2012). 
Where the number of participants randomised was not clearly 
stated in the included study report, we contacted the study authors 
for this information. </p>

<p>Potential promoters in the genome of Escherichia 
coli were searched by pattern recognition software 
<rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> and classified on the basis of positions 
relative to gene borders. Beside the expected pro-
moters located in front of the coding sequences 
we found a considerable amount of intragenic 
promoter-like signals with a putative ability to 
drive either antisense or alternative transcription 
and revealed unusual genomic regions with extre-
mely high density of predicted transcription start 
points (promoter 'islands'), some of which are 
located in coding sequences. <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> scores con-
verted into probability of RNA polymerase binding 
demonstrated certain correlation with the enzyme 
retention registered by ChIP-on-chip technique; 
however, in 'dense' regions the value of correlation 
coefficient is lower than throughout the entire 
genome. Experimental verification confirmed the 
ability of RNA polymerase to interact and form 
multiple open complexes within promoter 'island' 
associated with appY, yet transcription efficiency 
was lower than might be expected. Analysis of 
expression data revealed the same tendency for 
other promoter 'islands', thus assuming functional 
relevance of non-productive RNA polymerase bind-
ing. Our data indicate that genomic DNA of E. coli is 
enriched by numerous unusual promoter-like sites 
with biological role yet to be understood. </p>

<p>RNA polymerase (RNAPol)-binding sites (11-14). In this 
study we tried to understand how predictable the data 
obtained in silico are and to what extent they correlate 
with the data obtained in vivo. 
The genome-scale mapping of promoter sites has been 
performed by our pattern recognition software <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> 
(6,7). The same as other protocols operating with 
position-specific weight matrices, <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> has an advan-
tage of predicting transcription start points (TSP) (the 
main promoter attribute, which is determined experimen-
tally), rather than to define promoter regions as extensive 
genomic loci (9,10,15,16). Upon scanning <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> con-
siders any nucleotide as a probable point of transcription 
initiation and scores this probability by searching for 
promoter-specific elements in proper positions. Rather 
high precision and low rate of false positives made our 
software suitable for genome scanning, providing a possi-
bility to compare in silico and in vivo data. In the present 
work, we describe an overall map of TSPs predicted by 
<rs type="software">PlatProm</rs>; evaluate the degree of correlation between 
<rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> scores and RNAPol-binding efficiency regis-
tered by two independent research groups (12,13); focus 
attention on intragenic TSPs and promoter 'islands' 
having high density of transcription signals over long dis-
tance; and verify capacity of one 'island' to bind RNAPol 
and initiate RNA synthesis. </p>

<p>Our scoring system was designed as originally suggested 
by Hertz and Stormo (17). Sensitivity of this algorithm 
tested on our sets was the same as reported (Figure 1B). 
To increase the performance of this approach, we took 
into account sequence-dependent structural features in 
the genomic environment of promoter sites (6, 7). The 
final version of <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> (7) was refined on 271 experi-
mentally identified non-homologous and non-overlapping 
s 
70 -promoters with a single TSP precisely pointed out by 
the previous version of our software (6). All sequences 
were 411-bp long (À255/+155 according to the start 
point nominated as 0). Allowed variations of the spacer, </p>

<p>and www(n) 13,14 www thus minimizing overlap with 
(A) n -and (T) n -specific matrices. 
<rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> also takes into account perfect direct and 
inverted repeats (5-11 bp long separated by 5 or 6 bp) as 
potential targets for interaction with regulatory proteins. 
They are scored as natural logarithms of lengths if 
centered in subregions of their frequent occurrence 
(Figure 1B). 
The contributions of both types of repeats and elements 
accounted by cascade matrices were reduced by coeffi-
cients estimated as a ratio of the average information con-
tent [quantified as described in ref. (23)] in the particular 
subregion to the information content in the sixth position 
of the aligned element -35 (the least significant among 
conservative base pairs). This reduction was aimed to 
balance the endowment of additional elements with that 
of conservative base pairs. Inputs of all elements were 
summarized, giving the total score (S), which reflects the 
probability for any nucleotide to be a TSP and therefore 
the probability of its upstream region to bind RNAPol 
and fulfill promoter function. 
Performance of the program was tested on a set of 
290 known promoters and two control sets (CSs). All 
sequences were 411 bp long (À255/+155 according to 
real or virtual TSPs). The testing compilation was com-
posed of experimentally characterized s 
70 promoters not 
included in the training set. To increase the size of this set 
we allowed the presence of promoters ($30%) with mul-
tiple TSPs (for instance discussed below dcuA), while 
homologous or overlapping promoters were excluded. 
CS1 was composed of 273 coding sequences taken from 
the fixed position of all convergent genes longer than 
700 bp, separated by 50-bp intergenic space, which 
are not associated with promoter 'islands' (see below) 
and have 5 
0 -ends similarly annotated in U00096 and 
U00096.2 E. coli gene maps. Sequences were taken so as 
virtual TSPs were 250 bp far from initiating codon (fall in 
position 254 inside the gene). This strategy minimizes the 
probability to pick out functional promoter for alternative 
transcription or for yet unidentified genes in intergenic 
regions. Having AT-content (48.3%) very close to that 
of the whole genome (49.2%) CS1 roughly represents nat-
ural sequences, which RNAPol has to bypass. CS2 
was composed of 400 random sequences with the same 
AT-content as in chromosomal DNA. (All compilations 
are available by request.) Promoters were considered as 
recognized by <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> if experimentally mapped 
TSP(s) or a neighboring nucleotide (AE2) had score 
higher than threshold level. Using this criteria and the 
last version of <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> we identified 85.5% of promoters 
from the test compilation at zero level of false positives 
(level 1, Figure 1) in both CSs (S max = 3.4). Thus, at this 
level the combination of sensitivity (percentage of recog-
nized promoters = 85.5%) and specificity (percentage 
of unrecognized non-promoter sequences = 100%) of 
<rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> was better than that of previously suggested 
algorithms (68.7-82% and 82.2-99.1%, respectively) 
[(2,15,24) and Figure 1C]. Approximately 80% of recog-
nized promoters possess experimentally mapped TSPs 
coinciding (in the range of AE 2 bp) with positions of local 
S maxima, i.e. nearly 70% of natural TSPs are accurately </p>

<p>elements improve the resolution but the largest contribu-
tion is given by w-tracts increasing sensitivity for 27.6% 
(Figure 1B). This high significance of additional elements 
provides a chance to detect regulatory regions in newly 
sequenced genomes if information about their own pro-
moters is insufficient. 
Figure 2 exemplifies promoters accurately recognized 
(fadB) and unrecognized (dcuA) by <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs>. The start 
point of fadB-transcription exactly fits the experimentally 
mapped TSP (Figure 2B), while the original program (17) 
suggests intragenic P1 as a dominant transcription signal 
(Figure 2A) and algorithm developed by Huerta and 
Collado-Vides (1) predicts fadB promoter $150 bp 
upstream of the real TSP [see Figure 4 in (1)]. 
Unrecognized promoter P dcuA (Figure 2D-F) has four 
TSPs, experimentally mapped 69-72 bp upstream of the 
initiating codon (28). S values at these positions vary in 
the range À2.1/À5.7, i.e. far below the level required for 
recognition. All promoter-specific elements in P dcuA are 
weakly pronounced, thus no refinement of the current 
scoring system can compensate for these negative values. 
Although it can not be excluded that P dcuA has some 
important determinants, which are not formalized by 
<rs type="software">PlatProm</rs>, limitations of experimental mapping performed 
by primer extension (28) also may result in some difference 
between apparent and actual TSPs. Reverse transcriptase, 
for example, can stop at sites with stable hairpins in 
mRNA structure. In this case, the registered site of tran-
scription initiation would be pointed out downstream 
from the real one. <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> predicts a good candidate 
(P2) perfectly fitting the RNAPol-binding site registered 
by ChIP-on-chip assay (Figure 2F). Thus, comparing 
in silico and in vivo data one should take into account 
finite sensitivity and selectivity of computer model as 
well as limited accuracy of experimental approaches. 
Even though <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> may be further improved on the 
basis of additional features, current version predicts TSPs 
with rather high accuracy and was used to depict the 
genome-wide distribution of potentially transcribed 
regions. </p>

<p>The genome sequence of E. coli K12 (NCBI, GenBank 
entry U00096.2) was used for large-scale promoter predic-
tion (see Supplementary Table 1 for all <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> scores 
on both strands). Only signals with S &gt;7.44 (level 2 
in Figure 1D) were considered reliable. This cut-off level 
provides a possibility to identify only 51.0% of known 
promoters (Figure 1D) but ensures p &lt; 0.000043 
(Student's T-test statistics) if average S (À5.0) and SD 
(3.1) were estimated using scores of CS1. Artificially gen-
erated sequences of CS2 showed the same variability of 
S (SD = 3.1) but average score was higher (À4.2), thus 
assuming $2.5-fold higher p-value (p &lt; 0.00011). A total 
of 30 188 individual or clustered TSPs (Figure 2) forming 
$5000 promoter-like regions were found. Since only half 
of known promoters have TSPs with S &gt;7.44, the data 
obtained presume existence of more than 9000 of separate 
promoter-like sites, which is twice greater than the number 
of annotated genes in the genome of E. coli. To what </p>

<p>extent this excess could be explained by the presence of 
false positives? 
Relying on p-values only 399-928 of 30 188 predicted 
TSPs (1-3%) may be false signals (4 639 675 bp Â 2 Â p). 
However, intragenic and artificial sequences of CS1 and 
CS2 may be deficient in some promoter-specific features. 
That is why <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> performance was further tested in 
intergenic regions separating convergent genes, even </p>

(C and D) Discriminative capacity of algorithm suggested by Hertz and Stormo (C) and <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> (D) tested on natural sequences. Blue plots represent 
distribution of scores for virtual TSPs ascribed to +256 position of CS1 sequences. These data were used to estimate the average value of S, standard 
deviation and threshold levels (indicated by horizontal arrows). Red curves show distribution of scores for experimentally mapped TSPs of testing 
compilation (AE2 bp variations are allowed to pick out position with maximal score). These variations are aimed to compensate possible experimental or 
computational inaccuracy. In case of promoters with multiple TSPs, their scores were compared and the maximal one was plotted. These data are used 
to estimate percentage of recognized promoters (indicated above horizontal arrows) at two levels (S &gt; 3.4 and 7.44). Distribution of scores for TSPs 
of promoters regulated by repressors and activators are shown by small gray and large open circles, respectively. Ciphers in parenthesis indicate 
sensitivity of <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> for positively regulated promoters. Vertical arrows and ciphers above indicate position and value of average S. (E-G)

<p>As expected, AT-content of these regions is slightly higher 
(49.2%) than that of CS1 (48.3%). Altogether they 
contain four predicted TSPs (one per $2500 bp). If all of 
them are spurious, the probability to come across a false 
positive is 0.00039, i.e. higher than p-values mentioned 
above. However, two predicted TSPs are perfectly suitable 
for small regulatory RNAs HB_48 and HB_139 predicted 
by Carter et al. (29) and one is located in front of IS 
yi21_6. Supposing that they belong to real promoters, 
false positive rate given by statistic analysis and scanning 
procedure correspond to each other. Even if p = 0.00039 
is taken as a real frequency of false signals, still $90% 
of TSPs predicted by <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> should be considered as 
promoter-like signals deserving more detailed analysis. 
An important question is how to perceive <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> 
signals forming clusters near real and accurately recog-
nized by PlatProm TSPs (see Figure 2B for example). 
Should they be considered as false positives or not? 
To address this question we compared distribution of </p>

<p>Figure 2. Distribution of potential TSPs within regulatory regions of fadB/pepQ (A-C) and dcuA/aspA (D-F) as predicted by Hertz and Stormo 
algorithm (top panels) and <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> (middle panels). Black lines mark the coding sequences. Upward and downward bars reflect promoter scores 
quantified for the '+' and 'À' strands, respectively. X-axis is placed at 'level 1' (Figure 1). Dashed lines indicate 'level 2'. Red bars and arrows 
correspond to the experimentally mapped TSPs. Bottom plots show ChIP-on-chip data (13) for analyzed regions. Dashed arrows in plots (B) and (C) 
confine genomic area around the predicted or experimentally mapped TSP(s), where interaction with RNAPol was verified. Dashed arrows in plots 
(E) and (F) outline area nearby registered RNAPol-binding site, where predicted TSPs were searched. </p>

<p>noticeable divergence. That means that <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> scores 
around real TSPs are higher than background values. 
Thus, the total number of positions with S &gt;3.4 for 
AE2 bp area (1681 points) is significantly larger (852) 
than the total number of experimentally mapped starts 
including multiple ones (480). Detailed examination 
showed that $92% of additional signals are generated 
by <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> using the same frame for À35 and À10 hexa-
nucleotides as position with maximal S. Remaining 
ones correspond to alternative À10 element (4.4%) or 
À10 and À35 elements (3.6%), suggesting the presence 
of overlapping promoter. Promoters with multiple TSPs 
tend to have additional signals corresponding to alterna-
tive pair of core elements. Thus, in all cases <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> 
signals proximal to known TSPs denote the presence of 
either the same or alternative promoter and should not be 
considered as false positives. 
Predicted TSPs were classified in respect to the borders 
of mapped genes considering 750 bp as the allowed dis-
tance between the predicted transcription starts and the 
coding sequences of downstream genes [$10% of known 
promoters are 250-700 bp far from the coding sequences 
(6)]. Most predicted TSPs were ranked by this strategy 
as 'expected' promoters (Figure 3), although some of 
them fall into upstream genes (see, for instance P2 in 
Figure 2E). 
Approximately 19% of the remaining TSPs were found 
on the opposite strand of coding sequences (Figure 3). 
Antisense RNAs, if initiated therein, may block transla-
tion by base pairing with mRNAs, regulate their stability 
or interfere in other molecular processes. Such RNAs 
control expression of many plasmid and transposon 
genes, but until now they were not considered typical for 
bacterial regulatory networks. Nonetheless several lines of 
evidence support our predictions: </p>

<p>for all genes possessing predicted antisense promo-
ters (30). 
(ii) Among RNAs matching antisense strands and 
found by Vogel et al. (31) and Kawano et al. (32), 
10 species may be transcribed from intragenic pro-
moters predicted by <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs>. 
(iii) aRNAs I002 (33) and GadY (34) have 5 
0 -ends 
exactly pointed out by <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs>. 
(iv) Two intragenic promoters found by <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> 
within the coding sequences of hns and htgA/yaaW 
appeared to be active in vitro (35). </p>

<p>Thus, the first amusing outcome obtained from the 
genome scanning was a large amount of genes containing 
promoters with antisense orientation. 
Unexpected intragenic promoters of another group 
have sense orientation (Figure 3). About 23% of corre-
sponding TSPs lie &lt;50 bp downstream from the initiating 
codon. They were not considered as candidates for 
independent transcription initiation, since corresponding 
promoter-like regions may participate in polymerase trap-
ping near real promoters (1). Some intragenic promoters 
may intensify transcription of properly oriented down-
stream genes. If they are also ignored, there are still 
$400 potential TSPs with a less comprehensible destina-
tion. Some of them may produce RNAs antisense to 
mRNAs of the convergently oriented downstream genes. 
Synthesis of shortened mRNAs seems to be the most 
exotic assumption to date. At the same time, <rs id="software-33" type="software">ORF 
Finder</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-33" type="creator">NCBI</rs>) reveals alternative ORFs supplied with a 
suitable Shine-Dalgarno sequence downstream of $50% 
of intragenic co-directed promoters. </p>

<p>Figure 4. (A) Scheme illustrating the strategy used to convert <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> scores into probability of RNAPol binding (P). Fifty-nucleotide microarray 
probe is shown as a gray zigzag line. Dashed and composite lines represent two strands of DNA trapped by RNAPol. To take into account both 
orientations of the enzyme (gray triangle) P was calculated as the sum of S near the expected TSPs on both strands (indicated by braces). The most 
adequate values of P are expected if a given probe exactly fits to a promoter but allowed (AE8 bp) variation in position of the potential start ensures 
capturing scores of promoters shifted by 1-6 bp as well (microarray probes are distributed along DNA with 12 bp periodicity). Plot (C) shows the 
result of this converting procedure for <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> scores predicted in 57 9670-596 200 bp genomic region (B). Horizontal gray lines indicate gene 
positioning. The X-axis is placed at 'level 2'. Known TSPs of P cusR and P cusC are indicated. Three braces in plot (B) confine promoter 'islands'. Tick 
marks indicate positions of primers used for PCR. (D) RNAPol-binding efficiency represented as log 2 of the ratio of hybridization signal obtained 
with DNA co-immunoprecipitated with the enzyme by b 
0 -specific antibody to control DNA recovered from complexes without specific immunopre-
cipitation (12). (E) The same as (D) but s-specific antibody was used to collect RNAPol-DNA complexes (13). (F) Transcription efficiency from the 
top and the bottom strands, respectively, represented as log 2 of the ratio of fluorescence signals originated from hybridized cDNA to signals obtained 
from hybridized sonicated genomic DNA (13). </p>

<p>At the last step we estimated the degree of correlation 
between the values of <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> scores, and efficiencies 
of RNAPol binding. Since S reflects probability of any 
single nucleotide in the genome to be a TSP, while 
ChIP-on-chip method estimates efficiency of RNAPol 
binding to a particular genomic region represented by 
50 nt probes on high-density tiled microarrays, the pattern 
of S should be converted into a comparable mode. 
Converting procedure should take into account that the 
geometrical center of RNAPol-binding site does not coin-
cide with the TSP. Moreover, as RNAPol in vivo interacts 
with double-stranded DNA, samples prepared for chip-
hybridization contained both strands of enzyme-trapped 
fragments. Thus, fluorescent signal registered for a partic-
ular probe may result from two types of complexes 
differing in enzyme orientation (Figure 4A). Supposing 
each 50 nt probe as a target for interaction with polymer-
ase we thus considered the sum of S corresponding to the 
virtual TSPs on both strands as a probability of enzyme 
binding (P): </p>

<p>As the spacer length and the distance between the TSP 
and À10 element differ in real promoters, AE8 nt variation 
in +1 positioning has been allowed. Location of these 
regions relative to 5 
0 -ends was selected experimentally 
as position giving maximal correlation coefficient (R) 
between P and hybridization signals. Figure 4C shows 
the predicted TSPs of the Figure 4B converted in such a 
way. X-axis is shifted 1.96 SD (1 SD = 55.2) above the 
background level of P (average value of all negative P), 
providing p &lt; 0.05 for positive values. 
Log 2 ratios [(log 2 ) B ] reflecting efficiencies of RNAPol 
binding in vivo, obtained by Herring et al. in experiment 
2 (12) and by Reppas et al. in experiment B (13) were used 
to estimate correlation with P. Even though hybridization 
signals registered by two experimental assays differ in 
amplitude (Figure 4D and E), their profiles resemble 
each other and the pattern of P (Figure 4C). Quantified 
values of R are 0.51 (R H ) and 0.38 (R R ), respectively 
(Figure 6). R H is comparable with R values estimated 
for three replicates performed in similar conditions by 
the same research group (R = 0.46; 0.48 and 0.52) (12). 
Are these R H and R R values high or not? Although 
the data obtained in silico and in vivo reflect the same 
phenomena: anticipated and registered interaction with 
RNAPol, there are some peculiarities decreasing evaluated 
correlation. <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs>, for instance, accounts putative 
modules for interaction with regulatory proteins as </p>

<p>positive elements, though repressors decrease polymerase 
binding. Many weak RNAPol-binding sites are not 
detected in vivo due to low signal-to-noise ratio (12) but 
<rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> discriminates them. Intensity of ChIP signals 
from some promoters may disproportionately decrease 
due to possibility of epitope occlusion by other inter-
actions (12). Finally, <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> is currently attuned to 
s 
70 -specific promoters, while s 
70 -specific antibodies pre-
cipitate s 
28 as well (13). Usage of b 
0 -specific antibodies 
in combination with rifampicin-chase selection allows 
promoters of all types to be extracted. Considering all 
these realities, we conclude that both values of R are 
rather high. </p>

<p>The shape of Figure 6A reveals 2106 outliers with lower 
than expected hybridization signals (red symbols), which 
can not be attributed to experimental or technical errors, 
since oligonucleotide probes to the same genomic regions 
in the other ChIP-on-chip data set also tend to weaker 
hybridization (Figure 6B). This phenomenon can not be 
also explained by repressor functioning since the percent-
age of probes representing genes with inhibited transcrip-
tion (22%) among these outlying probes approximately 
equals the percentage (25%) of such genes in the 
genome [RegulonDB 5.5 (38)]. Further analysis showed 
that almost all out-of-ordered probes correspond to 
regions with multiple promoter-like sites and every one 
of 78 promoter 'islands' turned out to be represented in 
the prominent part of Figure 6A. They comprise 32% of 
all the deviating probes, rather than 0.7% expected by 
chance. R H and R R for promoter 'islands' are low: 0.09 
and 0.17, respectively. Thus, it appears that polymerase 
recognizes any single promoter-like site within the region 
of multiple competing promoters with less predictable effi-
ciency than across the whole genome. High density of 
promoter-like sites tends to weaken rather than strengthen 
RNAPol binding. 
To explore further this phenomenon a set of 181 known 
promoters accurately recognized in silico and possessing 
no more than two additional <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> signal(s) on either 
strand in a AE50 bp area was compiled (Supplementary 
Table 3). Amid others it contains promoters P fadB , P cusC , 
and P cusR (Figures 2 and 4). Only 21 promoters from this 
set contribute to the population of 2106 outlying probes 
by 42 representatives, which is exactly as much as expected 
by chance ($2%). The set of 'normal' promoters was com-
pared with 78 PIs in terms of RNAPol binding and tran-
scription efficiency calculated as described in Figure 6 
legend (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 6C). 
All PIs and 87% of 'normal' promoters (Supplementary 
Tables 2 and 3) form complexes with RNAPol. At the 
same time RNA synthesis has been detected for 107 
'normal' promoters (59%) but only for 20 out of 156 
(78 Â 2) genomic loci flanking promoter 'islands' (13%). 
Figure 6C illustrates expression efficiency and RNAPol 
binding for two compared groups. Points representing 
promoter 'islands' are mainly concentrated in the 
bottom part of the plot. The yield of particular RNAs in 
the cell may, therefore, depend on the presence of </p>

<p>Comprehensive annotation of newly sequenced genomes 
implying mapping of genes along with their regulatory 
elements is currently becoming a long-term strategy 
appealing for effective promoter-finders. In the case of 
genes encoding proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs, which by 
itself are accurately identified by almost perfectly attuned 
computer programs, promoter-finders may assist in local-
ization of regulatory regions. In the case of genes encoding 
small untranslated RNAs they are used to point out posi-
tions where sRNAs may be initiated (29,39), whereas 
other programs classify potential products as putative 
sRNAs based on their thermodynamic features and fold-
ing propensity. In the case of aRNAs promoter-finders 
may provide unique indicators of potential antisense tran-
scription. So far only two dozens of aRNAs at least partly 
synthesized from the antisense strands of other genes have 
been found in E. coli. This rather small number apparently 
does not reflect their multiplicity, as genome-wide expres-
sion studies registered a huge amount of RNAs generated 
from antisense strands (30); <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs> predicted many 
potential promoters for antisense transcription, while 
ChIP-on-chip technique detected suitable intragenic 
RNAPol-binding sites (12,13). Even though many signals 
registered by microarrays may result from run-through 
transcripts unterminated at 3 
0 -ends of neighboring genes, 
some promoters predicted in silico may be false positives 
while intragenic RNAPol-binding sites may represent 
paused elongation complexes, combined data vote for 
antisense transcription in bacteria. 
Along with potential TSPs for antisense transcription 
our screen revealed a large number of intragenic promo-
ters with sense orientation and preferred location near the 
initiating codon. Though expediency of alternative tran-
scription remains vague, very similar phenomenon has 
been recently registered in eukaryotic genomes [see, e.g. 
ref. (40)]. In the chromosome of E. coli, there are several 
pairs of extensively overlapping genes encoding two pro-
teins or a protein and an untranslated RNA. Many of 
them may be transcribed from common promoters. 
However genes hokC, tpr and ygeN with 5 
0 -ends mapped 
within mokC, rttR and ygeO, respectively, as well as 46 
transcripts partly matching sense strand and detected in 
the fraction of short RNAs by Vogel et al. (31) may be 
also initiated from their own promoters predicted by 
PlatProm. Internal promoters with sense orientation 
may, thus, mark candidates for alternative transcription. 
The data obtained drew attention to 78 regions with 
high density of TSPs over long distance. Fifty-five of 
them at least partly overlap with intergenic loci presumed 
to contain active promoters, nine of which are mapped 
experimentally. They initiate RNA synthesis from single 
or several (up to eight) positions. Multiplicity of the TSPs 
might, therefore, be exploited by transcription machinery. 
Four promoter-rich clusters lie between convergently </p>

<p>RGCs had been retrogradely labelled with DiI, followed by 
intravitreal delivery of SSP, annexin V-488 and PI. 
In this model, time-lapse video sequences (Figures 2a-e 
and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2) of single retinal areas 
over 5 h revealed a random distribution and appearance of 
apoptotic and necrotic cells, which was particularly highlighted 
by the 3D surface plot (Supplementary Video 2), and the 
average intensity projections of the time-lapse sequence 
shown in Figures 2f and g (generated by <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> RGB 
Zprojector plugin). A graphical analysis of the image 
sequence histograms demonstrated that the average intensity 
profiles of annexin V and PI changed significantly over time 
(examples shown in Figure 2h). 
These results demonstrate proof of principle that this 
technique enables the tracking of changes in individual retinal 
cells in the same eye over time, with the ability to temporally 
and quantitatively analyse changes in fluorescence intensity. 
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of 
high-resolution multi-wavelength imaging in visualising the 
death of single neurons in vivo. </p>

with labelled RGCs (DiI, blue) and intravitreal annexin V (green) and propidium iodide (PI, red) reveal a random distribution and appearance of annexin V-and PI-stained cells, 
but demonstrate the clear increase in PI staining over time. (DI, blue; annexin V, green; propidium iodide, red; time points and scale bar 100 mm as indicated). (f, g) Average

annexin (green) and PI (red) intensities taken from each image sequence histogram demonstrates that the profiles of annexin and PI change significantly over time, with a 
marked increase in late PI staining </p>

<p>annexin-V positivity and the development of PI staining 
varied from cell to cell, single-cell tracking allowed the 
delineation of the natural history of the fluorescence patterns. 
In this SSP model, 
1,9 single cells were identified from stills, 
and a random sample (n ¼ 30) was selected based on 
whether they were DiI positive (i.e., white spots identifying 
single RGCs, Figure 3a) and stained with annexin V-488, PI or 
both. A video analysis of selected tracked individual cells 
fulfilling these criteria (artificially labelled as light blue spots in 
Figure 3b) using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software and the Time Series 
Analyzer plugin allowed us to construct the intensity profiles 
of annexin V and PI. From these profiles, it was found that 
typically three patterns of fluorescent labelling were observed, </p>

<p>Assessing the phases of cell death in vivo. In vitro FACS 
analysis enables cells to be classified as being in early 
apoptosis (annexin V positive only), necrosis (PI only) or 
late-phase apoptosis (both annexin V and PI positive). To 
quantify the magnitude of late-phase apoptosis in vivo, we 
studied individual levels of annexin V, PI and their co-
localisation using our recently developed Ab model of RGC 
death. 
6 The advantages of this methodology are well 
established in the field of cell biology, and provide a 
snapshot of the status of RGC death at any one time. We 
also evaluated the effects of treatment with the N-methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA) channel blocker MK801, using the 
same analytical methods. 
Using the Ab model, we assessed the effects of intravitreal 
Ab (Ab 25À35 ), which was recently shown by us to induce RGC 
apoptosis in rodent eyes. 
6 Significant RGC death occurred 
72 h after intravitreal administration of 3.40 nmol Ab 25À35 to 
the right eye, a time that, in previous studies, was shown by us 
to yield peak levels of apoptosis (Figure 4). The left eye of 
each animal was treated with intravitreal 0.40 nmol MK801 at 
the same time as Ab. Wide-angle retinal images were 
recorded 2 h after intravitreal annexin (green) and PI (red) 
staining, as previously described. A typical image of an 
Ab 25À35 -treated right eye (Figure 4a) compared with the left 
MK801-treated eye of the same mouse (Figure 4b) demon-
strates that MK801 treatment reduces the numbers of annexin 
V (green)-and PI (red)-positive cells. 
To assess the relative levels of early apoptosis, late 
apoptosis and necrosis, we studied the co-localisation of PI 
and annexin V using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software with the Intensity 
Correlation Analysis plugin. 
12 Colour and raw scatter plots of 
annexin and PI fluorescence intensity were constructed from 
plugin-generated data for each animal. The corresponding 
scatter plots (blue) from the eyes shown in Figures 4a and b 
are illustrated in Figures 4c and d. Data were analysed in a 
manner similar to that of data derived by in vitro FACS 
analysis, with four quadrants (midlines shaded in colour 
overlay as red, green, blue and yellow) enabling separation of 
the different phases of cell death as annexin V positive (early 
apoptosis, green), annexin V and PI double positive (late 
apoptosis, yellow) and PI positive (necrosis, red). Thresholds 
were set automatically by the plugin for the analysis of each 
eye. We then used fluorescence intensity counts from the raw 
scatter plots to quantify each phase of cell death. MK801 </p>

<p>described earlier for Figure 2, we constructed a maximum 
intensity 3D projection of the time-lapse video sequences 
(Supplementary Video 3), using the <rs type="software">Image J</rs> RGB Zprojector 
and JaCoP plugin. The projection enabled the quantitative 
assessment of maximal annexin V and DiI staining at each 
pixel in the same retinal area studied over time. Although there 
was a high overlap ratio of annexin V staining with DiI (0.63, 
confirming the presence of apoptosis at the level of the 
RGCs), there was a very low ratio (0.072) of DiI cells also 
positive for annexin V. This demonstrates either that only 
some RGCs were ever annexin V positive and that apoptosis 
is not the only pathway responsible for cell death in this model, 
or that annexin V positivity is transient (as shown in Figure 3). 
We then investigated the presence of apoptotic and 
necrotic cells using PI and annexin V. At 3 weeks, in the 
OHT model, only a small proportion of RGCs was identified in 
early apoptosis compared with late apoptosis, as seen in a 
typical image in Figure 5g. Quantification of cell death phases 
was performed using the co-localisation scatter plots 
described previously. There was a significant (Po0.05) 
increase in cells in late-phase apoptosis compared with either 
necrosis or early-phase apoptosis (Figure 5i). Indeed, most 
labelled cells were in late-phase apoptosis (Anx þ /PI þ ), with 
relatively few cells exhibiting the diagnostic markers of necrosis 
(PI þ ) or early-phase apoptosis (Anx þ ). This distribution of 
dying cells is broadly similar to that seen in both the SSP and Ab 
models (Figure 4k) at the time of peak apoptosis. 
We next assessed whether neuroprotective treatment 
altered the relative numbers of cells in each of the cell death 
phases, using the NMDA antagonist MK801, which we have 
previously shown to be effective in this model. 
9 Treatment 
with MK801 at the time of IOP elevation significantly reduced 
the numbers of both annexin V-and PI-positive cells 
(Figure 5h). Co-localisation scatter plot analysis showed a 
significant reduction in total cell death markers (Po0.05), and 
specifically a significant reduction in both late-phase apoptosis 
and necrosis, compared with untreated OHT eyes at 3 weeks 
after elevated IOP induction. </p>

Scatter plots show the distribution of annexin and PI fluorescence intensity in the eyes shown in (a, b), Ab alone (c) and Ab þ MK801 (d). (e) Thresholds were set 
automatically by the plugin for each analysis (colour overlay in (c, d)), and quantification of each cell death phase was performed from generated data (e). MK801 treatment 
reduced the overall levels of cell death (blue, total), mostly by reducing the number of cells in late-phase apoptosis (yellow, Anx þ /PI þ ) and necrosis (red, PI þ ). (f, g) Wide-
angle retinal images showing the Ab-treated right eye (f) and Ab þ PMA-treated left eye (g) of a single mouse. (h, i) PMA increased the level of annexin V (green) and PI (red) 
positivity, as shown in the corresponding scatter plots. (j) Quantification of all treated animals shows that PMA significantly (Po0.05) increases the overall levels of cell death 
(blue, total), most of this being due to a significant (Po0.05) increase in the number of cells in the early phase of apoptosis (green, Anx þ ). (k) Comparison of cell phases in all 
Ab and SSP models using co-localisation scatter plot analysis. At the previously established time points of maximal apoptosis (Ab ¼ 72 h and SSP ¼ 2 h), both models show a 
similar trend, with no significant difference in the magnitude of any phase of cell death. However, both models show significantly more RGCs in the phases of late apoptosis 
(P40.05, yellow, Anx þ /PI þ ) and necrosis (P40.05, red, PI þ ) than early apoptosis (green, Anx þ ). Error bars 95% confidence intervals, *Po0.05 </p>

<p>Imaging. All rats had in vivo retinal imaging performed at regular and set 
intervals after experimental treatment using a prototype Zeiss cSLO, as previously 
described. 
1,11 Imaging was performed under general anaesthesia with animals 
being held in a stereotaxic frame, with their pupils dilated. Different lasers and filters 
were used for different fluorochromes: for excitation of Alexa Fluor 488, an argon 
laser wavelength of 488 nm and a solid state photodetector with a 521 nm cut-off 
filter and a 550 nm cut-on filter were used; for DiI, a diode-pumped crystal green 
laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used with 550 nm cut-off and 600 nm cut-on

cSLO used in this study is the same as that described previously, with modifications 
complying with the established standards for safety and light exposure.

developed a purpose-written software to allow optimal processing of low-light 
fluorescent signals, which has greatly aided our live cell imaging. 
1 Monochrome 
images from each area were acquired using the appropriate laser setup and 
colourised. Three-colour images were produced by combining each of the grey 
scale images from the cSLO into the red (PI), green (annexin 488) and blue 
channels (DiI) of an RGB colour image. Images were processed in this way because 
red, green and blue (RGB) colours are universally accepted as the most informative 
methods for showing co-localisation. The <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> Intensity Correlation Analysis 
plugin was applied to generate co-localisation scatter plots and colour thresholds. </p>

plots, RGB projections and to analyse co-localisation (JaCoP and Intensity 
Correlation Analysis). Graphical data for mean values were contrived with 95% 
confidence intervals, and comparisons across groups were performed using 
ANOVA or Student's t-test for paired eyes, with Po0.05 as the significance level. </p>

correction was operated at 10 Hz and ran in closed-loop during image acquisition. 
To compensate for the low fluorescence emission in a standard two-photon microscope, 
light at each pixel is integrated for a long period of time, but this is not possible in the living 
eye because of continual motion. Instead, up to 16,500 individual fluorescence frames (12 
minute acquisition) were registered and added together to produce the final image. Dual-
image capture and registration (custom software, <rs type="software">DeMotion</rs> [8]), in which the motion trace of 
a simultaneously obtained high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reflectance image is used to 
register a low SNR fluorescence video, was needed [3-5]. In addition, to compensate for the 
longitudinal chromatic aberration of the eye, the reflectance and two-photon excited 
fluorescence inputs were pre-adjusted to be focused on the same plane within the eye. </p>

<rs id="software-5" type="software">DIANA-microT</rs><rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.microrna.gr/webServer</rs><rs id="software-6" type="software">DIANA-microT</rs><rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">v5.0</rs><rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Taverna</rs><rs id="software-8" type="software">Workflow 
Management System</rs>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs 
($21-23 nt in length) that post-transcriptionally regulate 
gene expression by blocking translation or inducing deg-
radation of the targeted mRNA (1). Since their first iden-
tification in Caenorhabditis elegans in 1993 (2), the number 
of annotated miRNAs and miRNA-related publications 
increase in a super linear rate, clearly depicting their 
central position in the RNA revolution (3). 
In silico miRNA target identification is a crucial step in 
most miRNA experiments, as the miRNA interactome has 
not yet been adequately mapped, even for the most 
studied model organisms. Early miRNA-related research 
efforts have highlighted the necessity of computational 
analyses in order to assist the experimental identification 
of miRNA targets. This has resulted to the development of 
numerous miRNA target prediction algorithms (4), which 
are now considered indispensable for the design of 
relevant experiments. These algorithms identify in silico 
miRNA targets as candidates for further experimentation 
or for computational processing, such as target enrich-
ment analyses. Predictions of the available computational 
algorithms can be acquired from relevant interaction data-
bases or web servers (4,5). </p>

<p>The <rs id="software-11" type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server <rs corresp="#software-11" type="version-number">v4.0</rs> (6) is focused on 
providing in silico predictions of miRNA-mRNA inter-
actions. It is characterized by a user-friendly interface 
and provides extensive information for predicted 
miRNA-target gene interactions such as a global score 
for each interaction, as well as detailed information for 
all predicted target sites. Each target site can be visualized, 
and the user can examine its local prediction score, target 
site conservation and miRNA-mRNA binding structure. 
The server also provides connectivity to online biological 
databases and offers links to nomenclature, sequence and 
protein databases. 
Here, we present <rs id="software-12" type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">v5.0</rs>, a 
significantly updated version, which hosts the state-of-
the-art target prediction algorithm, DIANA-microT-
CDS (7). microT-CDS is the only algorithm available 
online, specifically designed to identify miRNA targets 
both in 3 
0 untranslated region (3 
0 UTR) and in coding 
sequences (CDS). The new server detects miRNA targets 
in mRNA sequences of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, 
Drosophila melanogaster and C.elegans. Furthermore, it 
has been updated to miRBase v18 (8) and <rs id="software-13" type="software">Ensembl</rs> <rs corresp="#software-13" type="version-number">v69</rs> 
(9). Specific attention has been paid to the web server 
interface, which follows the DIANA design framework, 
to be instantly familiar to users of previous versions, or 
other DIANA tools (Figure 1). On the other hand, online 
help, informative tooltips and easy-to-use menus minimize 
the learning curve of new users. The fifth version of the 
DIANA-microT web server focuses also on advanced 
users and laboratories requiring support for sophisticated 
pipelines. The server provides programmatic access to 
services of multiple DIANA algorithms and a complete 
integration with the <rs type="software">Taverna Workflow Management 
System</rs> (WMS) (10), using the in-house developed 
DIANA-Taverna Plug-in. Furthermore, a new section of 
the web interface hosts ready-made advanced workflows 
that can perform extensive miRNA-related analyses on 
results derived from high-throughput techniques, such as 
microarrays or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). </p>

<p><rs type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> server has been updated to miRBase v18 
and <rs id="software-18" type="software">Ensembl</rs> <rs corresp="#software-18" type="version-number">v69</rs>. The server is compatible with the new 
miRNA nomenclature (3p/5p) introduced in miRBase 
v18, as well as with previous miRNA naming conventions. 
It currently supports 7.3 Â 10 
6 H.sapiens, 3.5 Â 10 </p>

<p>C.elegans interactions between 3876 miRNAs and 64 750 
protein-coding genes. Gene (9) and miRNA (13) expres-
sion annotation has been incorporated into the web server, 
enabling the user to perform advanced result filtering 
based on tissue expression. Furthermore, users can also 
restrict predictions between uploaded lists of expressed 
genes and/or miRNAs. For example, this feature can be 
used to identify interactions between a list of repressed (or 
overexpressed) genes and overexpressed (or repressed) 
miRNAs, in the case of a differential expression analysis 
pipeline. 
Moreover, the web server hosts an updated version of 
the KEGG database providing a relevant search module 
based on KEGG pathway descriptions (14). A redesigned 
optional user space has also been implemented, which 
provides personalized features and facilitates the 
interconnectivity between the web server and the available 
<rs type="software">DIANA</rs> software and databases (Figure 1). </p>

<p>As high-throughput data have become the new backbone 
of biological research, there is an increasing need to 
support advanced high-throughput analysis pipelines. 
The new <rs type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server aims to facilitate 
users, not having access to extensive computational 
infrastructures and support, to perform ready-to-use 
sophisticated pipelines. 
<rs id="software-24" type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server <rs corresp="#software-24" type="version-number">v5.0</rs> hosts numerous 
integrated analyses in the form of ready-made advanced 
pipelines, covering a wide range of inquiries regarding pre-
dicted or validated miRNA-gene interactions and their 
impact on metabolic and signalling pathways. These pipe-
lines can be used to analyse user data derived from small 
scale and high-throughput experiments directly from the 
<rs type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server interface, without the neces-
sity to install or implement any kind of software. 
For instance, one of the available workflows (Figure 2) 
can analyse mRNA and miRNA expression data (expres-
sion and fold change). Suppressed genes are automatically 
matched with overexpressed miRNAs (and vice versa). 
The workflow performs enrichment analysis of experimen-
tally validated targets derived from DIANA-TarBase v6.0 
(3) or/and predicted interactions from microT-CDS. This 
step is considered crucial to identify miRNAs that signifi-
cantly regulate the differentially expressed genes. 
The prediction score threshold can significantly affect 
the analysis steps that follow. In the case of predicted 
interactions, the pipeline can be optimized by automatic </p>

<p>repetitions of different prediction thresholds (from sensi-
tive to more stringent), to minimize the effect of the 
selected settings to the result. By using meta-analysis stat-
istics, the server combines the P-values from each repeti-
tion into a total P-value for each miRNA, signifying its 
effect on the selected genes for all used thresholds (15,16). 
In the last step of the pipeline, the identified miRNAs are 
subjected to a functional analysis, where pathways 
controlled by the combined action of these miRNAs are 
detected using <rs id="software-27" type="software">DIANA-miRPath</rs> <rs corresp="#software-27" type="version-number">v2.1</rs> (16). 
Other available pipelines can handle miRNA and gene 
lists, to perform the enrichment analysis, or even select the 
type of used interactions (predicted or experimentally 
validated). In the latter workflow, the algorithm 'personal-
izes' the target identification module for each miRNA. It 
initially identifies the number of available interactions in 
DIANA-TarBase and DIANA-microT-CDS (validated 
versus predicted) and automatically selects to use validated 
targets only in the cases of well-annotated miRNAs. 
Computationally identified interactions are used otherwise. 
The new <rs type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server enables users to 
perform such analyses directly from the on-line user inter-
face, or create even more extensive pipelines programmat-
ically or by using visual tools (<rs type="software">Taverna WMS</rs>). </p>

<p><rs id="software-30" type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server <rs corresp="#software-30" type="version-number">v5.0</rs> was completely re-
designed to provide the necessary building blocks for </p>

<p>easily incorporating miRNA functional analysis in 
complex pipelines. The new <rs type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server 
aims to facilitate advanced users in creating novel or 
enhancing existing pipelines with miRNA target identifi-
cation and functional analysis tools. To this end, <rs id="software-32" type="software">DIANA-
microT</rs> web server <rs corresp="#software-32" type="version-number">v5.0</rs> provides a complete integration 
with the <rs type="software">Taverna WMS</rs>, using our in-house developed 
DIANA-Taverna Plug-in. 
DIANA-<rs type="software">Taverna</rs> Plug-in enables the user to directly 
access our target prediction server (microT-CDS) from 
the graphic interface of Taverna and incorporate 
advanced miRNA analysis functionalities into custom 
pipelines. Furthermore, the plug-in enables the extension 
of such pipelines through the use of other DIANA tools 
and databases, providing access to the most extensive col-
lection of validated miRNA targets (DIANA-TarBase 
v6.0) and to <rs id="software-37" type="software">DIANA-miRPath</rs> <rs corresp="#software-37" type="version-number">v2.1</rs>, a tool designed for 
the identification of miRNA targeted pathways. 
Furthermore, the web server also supports direct pro-
grammatic access to all aforementioned utilities in the 
form of services, to facilitate users having already imple-
mented pipelines using scripting or programming 
languages. </p>

<p>miRNA-mRNA interactions. These techniques provide 
great numbers of differentially expressed miRNAs and 
genes, which have to be analysed in sophisticated pipe-
lines. The new <rs type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> web server aims to 
further increase the target prediction accuracy and usabil-
ity of the server interface, while facilitating users aiming to 
perform complex miRNA-related analyses. 
Compared with the previous version, the new web 
server has received a major upgrade and is currently up 
to date with key miRNA/gene repositories, such as 
<rs id="software-40" type="software">Ensembl</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-40" type="version-number">v69</rs>) and miRBase (v18). The Taverna Plug-in 
and the integration of cutting-edge workflows in the web 
interface provide the missing link between experimental 
results and state-of-the-art functional meta-analyses. </p>

<p>Figure 2. Flowchart depicting an analysis pipeline directly available from the web server interface. Interactions between user-defined miRNA and 
gene sets are in silico identified in 3 
0 UTR and CDS regions using DIANA-microT-CDS. A subsequent miRNA target enrichment analysis identifies 
miRNAs controlling significantly the sets of differentially expressed genes. The pipeline is automatically repeated for different prediction thresholds 
(from more sensitive, to more stringent). By using meta-analysis statistics, the server combines the P-values from each repetition into a total P-value 
for each miRNA, signifying its effect on the selected genes for all used thresholds. In the last step of the pipeline, miRNA-targeted pathway analysis 
is implemented with <rs id="software-38" type="software">DIANA-miRPath</rs> <rs corresp="#software-38" type="version-number">v2</rs>. </p>

<p>In the paper there is utilized only one part of economics 
area. This count has been designed in different industry 
fields. From point of view of factor analysis this sample is 
adequate. 
Results and discussion of the paper are based on the ana-
lysis of secondary sources and selected data of questionnaire 
survey, which are involved on measuring the performance 
of Czech companies. To process the results of the question-
naire survey were used both of basic types of descriptive 
statistics and factor analyze on the selected data set. The 
data were processed by using the statistical program <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs> 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">20</rs>. </p>

<p>1 Electronic databases. We conducted several 
database searches. We started with three 
databases where relevant quantitative impact 
evaluations were expected to be found: Econ-
Lit, the Impact Evaluation Repository of the 
International Initiave for Impact Evaluation 
(3ie), and PubMed. In addition, as a check, we 
performed a cross-database search using the 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">EBSCO</rs> Discovery Service (<rs id="software-0" type="software">OneSearch</rs>) that 
covered the following databases: Medline, 
SocIndex, Science Direct, JSTOR journals, 
PsycInfo and SocWork Abstracts. 
2 Citation chasing. The reference list of every 
included paper was checked to identify any 
possible additional studies. 
3 Internet searches. Finally, we used the 
advanced search options in <rs type="software">Google</rs> and <rs type="software">Google 
Scholar</rs> for a search of the World Wide Web. </p>

<p>easily be excluded given the lack of relevance 
based on the title. If the study was included based 
on the title, the abstract was then reviewed. If the 
study was included based on the abstract, the full 
text of the article was retrieved and checked 
against the inclusion criteria above. We report 
below on our main database searches. Other 
searches (within the same database using differ-
ent terms, or in different databases) did not lead 
to any additional results. 
The EconLit search with 'health insurance' and 
'children' as search terms connected with the 
Boolean operator (AND) yielded 246 papers, of 
which we included seven published or working 
papers. 
The 3ie repository, using 'health insurance' as 
a search term, led to 69 results, of which we 
included six papers (two of these six papers had 
already been found in EconLit). 
The PubMed database (using 'health insur-
ance', 'children' and 'developing countries') led 
to 211 papers: we excluded all but two studies, 
both of which had already been found in the 
EconLit and 3ie searches. 
We checked the results of the above searches 
with a cross-database search using the <rs type="software">EBSCO 
Discovery Service</rs> for the cross-database search. 
This search yielded 838 records, none of which 
were in addition to those that had been previously 
identified through the search of EconLit, Pub Med 
and the 3ie repository. 
Finally, through citation chasing and internet 
searches, we identified two more papers, leading 
to a total of 13 papers. 
It should be noted that we do not aggregate the 
outcomes of the studies into a meta-analysis. 
Many of the outcome measures and estimation 
strategies that we found were not comparable 
across studies, and the insurance programs were 
different across countries. It would thus be 
misleading to aggregate their results. </p>

<p>transitions have been progressing slowly for the last 
four decades (2). 
The HDSS area consists of 142 villages of varying 
population size; ranging from 117 to 9,466 (9). The 
average population of a village is 1,578. Community 
female interviewers visited every household monthly up 
to 2006 and bi-monthly from 2007 to record vital 
events (births, deaths, migration, marriages and marital 
disruptions) that happened since their last visit. Since 
1986, each death is subject to verbal autopsy for 
assessment of possible cause of death. Two tiers of 
supervision and an independent quality control team 
ensure that registration of vital events is complete and the 
date of the event is precise. Data on the number of deaths 
and children aged below 5 years in the HDSS area in 
1998Á2007 were obtained from the HDSS longitudinal 
database and disaggregated by village and year. 
The 1996 socioeconomic census recorded individual's 
education, occupation and household durables: bed stand, 
chair-table, cupboard, radio, television, bike (including 
motorbike), land owned, materials of wall, roof and floor 
of the main dwelling unit and type of toilet used. These 
durables were used to classify households into quintiles 
(11). A principal components analysis of household 
durables retained one factor and assigned a factor score 
to each household. The higher the score, the higher the 
number of household assets, indicating better long-term 
economic status of the household. The factor score was 
used to divide the households into quintiles Á from the 
lowest 20% to the highest 20%. A higher household assets 
quintile reflects the higher economic status of the house-
hold. Adult (aged 15 years or older) education (measured 
by persons having education class 5 or higher) and 
household-level assets quintiles were aggregated across 
all households in the village to compute the village-level 
adult education rate (in percent) and economic status 
(percentage of households in top two asset quintiles). 
Villages are not homogeneous in education and economic 
status. Village-level adult education varied from 34 to 
83% and economic status from 19 to 57%. Clustering in 
mortality at the village-level may be an effect of 
clustering of the risk factors; education and poverty at 
village-level. 
Small villages (having less than 1,000 inhabitants) are 
merged with adjacent villages that are more similar in 
terms of adult education and economic status. After 
merging the small villages, we are left with 90 villages (or 
clusters) for analysis. GIS of the HDSS generates spatial 
data: geo-coordinates of each bari (group of households 
that share a common yard and whose heads are usually 
related by blood) and land marks (tube-wells, health 
facilities, schools, markets, mosques and temples) in 
degree decimal format. <rs type="software">ArcGIS</rs> software is used to create 
a polygon of each village and to pick the centroid 
(defined by the centre of gravity). In case of centroids </p>

<p>some years and some had more than expected by chance. In 
1998, mortality rates in the villages ranged from 0.0 to 37.8, 
and in 2007, mortality rates in the villages ranged from 0.0 
to 27.9. 
The <rs type="software">SaTScan</rs> </p>

<p>decline was faster in the high-risk clusters than in the 
average-risk cluster and achieved equity. A common 
drawback of Kulldorff's method is that clusters are defined 
as circles or cylindrical windows with circular base (5, 6). 
Actual clusters (or villages) are irregular in shape. This 
feature has some implications for the interpretation of the 
results. If a village with low mortality is surrounded by 
villages with high mortality, it is included in the cluster 
although some characteristics of the village are different 
from other villages. If clustering of mortality is, say, along 
the river, then a circular shape is not appropriate to detect 
it. The first limitation is similar to that of the control trial 
cohort, and the overall effect on the result would be small. 
The second limitation can be minimised by viewing an 
<rs type="software">ArcGIS</rs> map. 
Each high-risk cluster comprises a set of adjacent 
villages. The most likely mortality cluster consists of 
22 villages adjacent to each other. They are in close 
proximity of the big river, the 'Meghna', and are exposed 
to more natural disasters such as river erosion and 
monsoon flooding. The secondary cluster consists of 18 
villages on the banks of the rivers Gumti and Dhonogoha 
and in adjacent low-lying areas. These villages are remote 
Á far away from the sub-district town and health facility. 
What causes difference in mortality between clusters 
demands in-depth study. 
People in high-risk clusters may be of lower education 
and economic status compared to their peers in aver-
age risk clusters in addition to the natural disasters and 
geo-access to health services. Control for the village-
level adult education and household economic status 
reduced the odds ratios of dying in the high-risk clusters a 
little, but remained significant. This suggests that spatial 
and some environmental factors in addition to edu-
cation and economic factors affect health. Causal factors 
may be at the demand side (hygiene and health care </p>

<p>was variable, we allowed for left truncation with time at risk 
starting on the date of diagnosis and time under observation 
beginning at the time of study entry. Analyses were right censored 
at 5 years after ovarian carcinoma diagnosis in order to reduce the 
number of non-ovarian carcinoma-related deaths. The propor-
tional hazard assumption was evaluated with standard diagnostic 
methods, including likelihood ratio tests comparing models with 
and without terms that modelled covariates as a function of follow-
up time on the natural logarithmic scale (Hosmer and Lameshow, 
1999). Final models were fitted using Cox regression stratified by 
study to correct for violations of the proportional hazard 
assumption and adjusted for potential confounding with age at 
diagnosis (o70 or X70 years), FIGO tumour stage (I/II, III/IV or 
missing) and presence of residual disease at primary surgery 
(macroscopic, no macroscopic or missing). An interaction term 
between the aforementioned covariates and follow-up time was 
included, where necessary, to improve model fit. In addition, we 
considered models separately by the FIGO tumour stage. Data for 
regression analyses were available for 2636 patients following the 
exclusion of patients with missing vital status (N ¼ 13), missing 
time from diagnosis to study entry (N ¼ 66), missing follow-up 
time (N ¼ 43), missing FIGO stage (N ¼ 84, excluded for stage-
stratified analyses only) and patients with study entry 45 years 
from diagnosis (N ¼ 43). 
Using TCGA data, FOLR1 mRNA information was available for 
485 patients and we defined mRNA upregulation as 41 s.d. from the 
mean on the log2 scale. Associations with OS and PFS were evaluated 
with follow-up time as described above and adjusted for the FIGO 
tumour stage (I/II, III/IV or missing) and presence of residual disease 
at primary surgery (macroscopic, no macroscopic or missing). 
Separate models also adjusted for platinum therapy sensitivity 
(resistant, sensitive, too early or missing) and treatment response 
(complete response, partial response, progressive disease, stable 
disease or missing). Age at diagnosis was not available in TCGA.

<p>p.P88T Mutation in GJA8 identification and analysis. Direct cycle 
sequencing of the amplified fragments of the GJA8 gene in one 
affected individual (IV: 3) identified a C . A transversion in exon 
2 at nucleotide 264 (Figure 2A) with no other changes in the coding 
sequence of GJA8. This transversion caused a substitution of 
Threonine (T) for Proline (P) at codon 88 (p.P88T). Results of 
additional sequencing demonstrated that this mutation co-
segregated with all affected individuals in the family, and was not 
observed in any of the unaffected family members. Denaturing 
HPLC analysis confirmed this mutation, which cosegregated with 
all affected individuals in the family, and this mutation was not 
observed in any of the unaffected family members or 100 normal 
controls. The remainder of the coding sequence, including that of 
GJA3, did not show any sequence change. The p.P88T mutation was 
not present in multiple databases, including the dbSNPs (v130), 
HapMap, 1000 Genome, and 702 in-house exome data. 
Multiple-sequence alignments of Cx50 in various species were 
obtained (Figure 2B). We found that codon 88, where mutation 
(p.P88T) occurred, is located within a highly conserved region. To 
date, 33 mutations have been identified in human Cx50; we sum-
marize all reported mutations in Figure 3. The prevalence of changes 
in proline 88 indicates that this residue is a mutation hot spot. The 
p.P88T substitution changes a nonpolar residue to a polar residue at 
this key site in the protein. The online bioinformatics software <rs id="software-0" type="software">SIFT</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://sift.jcvi.org</rs>/) predicts a deleterious effect of this substitution. 
Taken together, these data indicate that the p.P88T substitution is a 
causative disease mutation rather than a simple polymorphism. </p>

<p>Mutation screening and analysis. We designed a set of eight primer pairs (see 
Supplementary Table S1 online) to amplify the exons and flanking intron 
sequences of GJA3 (NM_021954) and GJA8 (NM_005267). Oligonucleotide 
primers and PCR information for amplification are shown in Supplementary 
Table S1. PCR products were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3730 DNA Sequencer. 
Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC, Wave DHPLC; 
Transgenomic, San Jose, CA) was used to confirm the identified mutation in the 
GJA8 gene using a commercial system on the patients, family members, and 100 
normal controls as previously described 
14 . Briefly, gene specific PCR primers (see 
Supplementary Table S1 online, Exon2a) were used to amplify the fragment that 
harbored the point mutation. After the amplification, about 100 ng of the PCR 
product was denatured for 3 min at 96uC and then gradually reannealed by 
decreasing sample temperature from 95 to 55uC over a period of 30 min. PCR 
products were then separated with a DHPLC machine as follows: initial 
concentration at 44% of buffer A (0.1 M triethylammonium acetate, TEAA; 
Transgenomic) and 56% of buffer B (0.1 M TEAA containing 25% acetonitrile; 
Transgenomic) at 62.0uC. 
Using the websites of NCBI and UCSC, we obtained the Cx50 sequence from 
Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Heterocephalus glaber, Tupaia 
chinensis, Pteropus alecto and sequences of Cx40 and Cx43 from Homo sapiens. 
Using <rs type="software">DNAMAN</rs> biosoftware, multiple-sequence alignment of Cx50 sequences 
from these species was obtained. Furthermore, we used the online bioinformatics 
software <rs id="software-3" type="software">SIFT</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">http://sift.jcvi.org</rs>/) to predict whether the amino acid substitution 
p.P88T in Cx50 could have a phenotypic effect. </p>

<p>weak alleles near the double-strand breaks that initiate re-
combination events. Episodes of gBGC in a genomic region 
could produce an association between W/S substitutions 
and substitution density (BDS) by driving W/S mutations to 
fixation in recombination hotspots. We investigate the ori-
gin of BDS by examining correlations between BDS and ge-
nomic variables, including recombination rates, in different 
species. 
To examine BDS in a broader phylogenetic context, we 
characterized recent substitutions in eight trios of eukaryotic 
organisms including: human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus 
musculus), dog (Canis familiaris), chicken (Gallus gallus), stick-
leback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), fruit fly (Drosophila mela-
nogaster), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), and yeast 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We selected these species based 
on availability of sequenced genomes for a closely related 
comparison taxon and an outgroup, quality of the genome 
assemblies, and (if possible) availability of recombination 
maps. 
To enable these genome-wide analyses, we inferred sub-
stitution histories using maximum likelihood and a context-
dependent model of evolution with the <rs id="software-6" type="software">PHAST</rs> package 
(Hubisz et al. <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-date">2011</rs>). This approach accounts directly for 
CpG hypermutability and other context effects that can lead 
to incorrect inference of substitution type (e.g., W/S vs. 
not W/S) in parsimony-based analyses. Next, we analyzed 
substitution patterns using a new efficient statistical test for 
the association of nucleotide substitution types with substi-
tution rates and genome annotations. Most previous studies 
of substitution patterns in divergent regions have focused on 
discrete predefined elements across the genome; in contrast, 
our approach is more broad and allows a flexible continuous 
definition of ''divergent'' based on the density of substitution 
across the genome. Our work extends the approach of 
Dreszer et al. (2007) and provides a more rigorous statistical 
framework for measuring associations between substitution 
type and density. 
Using these tools, we confirm the previously observed 
pattern of BDS in the human genome and its association 
with elevated recombination rates. Our analysis of non-
primate clades shows that BDS is common outside of hu-
man, though not universal. When BDS is present, it exists 
in both coding and noncoding sequence and is often, but 
not always, correlated with high rates of recombination. 
This correlation, paired with the lack of W/S bias in 
within-species polymorphisms, argues that a recombina-
tion-driven fixation bias for strong nucleotides, such as 
that produced by gBGC, may be involved in the production 
of BDS, especially when there is variation in strength and 
location of gBGC over time. Overall, the strong evidence 
we find for BDS in many eukaryote genomes highlights the 
importance of understanding its causes and developing 
statistical models of DNA and protein evolution that incor-
porate these observations. </p>

phastCons (Siepel et al. 2005; Hubisz et al. 2011) scores

The raw single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 
human and mouse come from dbSNP (Sherry et al. 2001) 
release 130 and 128, respectively. SNPs for chicken were 
identified by the Beijing Genomics Institute and downloaded 
from the UCSC Genome Browser bgiSNP track. 
Recombination rate data were obtained from a variety of 
sources. For human, we used the combined recombination 
map from the HapMap project (The International Hapmap 
Consortium 2007), as well as the deCODE genetics male 
and female maps which are based on 15,257 Icelandic 
parent-offspring pairs (Kong et al. 2010). Mouse recombi-
nation data were downloaded from the Mouse Map Con-
verter (Jackson Laboratories 2009), which is based on SNP 
analysis across 46 families (Shifman et al. 2006; Cox et al. 
2009). The chicken recombination map from Groenen et al. 
(2009) is based on SNPs across three mapping populations. 
For fruit fly, the Drosophila Recombination Rate Calculator 
(Fiston-Lavier et al. 2010), which compares genetic and 
physical maps of the genome to infer recombination rates, 
was used. </p>

<p>applied in each clade considered. First, repetitive sequences 
as identified by the UCSC Genome Browser alignment pipe-
line were not considered. These regions were identified us-
ing the Tandem Repeats Finder and <rs type="software">RepeatMasker</rs> (Smit and 
Hubley 2008-2010) and are indicated by lowercase letters in 
the alignments. (See the Genome Browser documentation for 
more details.) Next, the quality of the alignment around each 
position was considered. If there were any insertions or dele-
tions between the reference and comparison species within 
five base pairs (bp) of a position, then it was not considered. 
Finally, all positions in regions of the genome that had signif-
icant homology to another region of the genome were filtered 
out. These duplicated or repetitive regions are often difficult to 
align to other species due to their similarity. These regions 
were removed using the Genome Browser's chainSelf track 
of significant alignments of a genome with itself. </p>

<p>ested in substitutions that occurred in the reference species 
since its divergence from the last common ancestor with 
the comparison species-for example, on the human lineage 
after its last common ancestor with chimpanzee. These 
branches of interest are indicated in red in figure 1. After fil-
tering the alignments as described above, we fit a context-
dependent dinucleotide phylogenetic model to the align-
ments for each chromosome using maximum likelihood. 
We used the general unrestricted dinucleotide model with 
strand symmetry (U2S) (Siepel and Haussler 2004). This phy-
logenetic model was fit to the alignments with <rs type="software">phyloFit</rs> from 
the <rs id="software-14" type="software">PHAST</rs> software package (Hubisz et al. <rs corresp="#software-14" type="version-date">2011</rs>). Using the

expectednumberof substitutionsof eachtypeon each branch 
of the tree for each site in the alignment. </p>

<p>Independent t-tests were used to compare the mean

Our methods are identical to those described previously ( Yu et al.,

fi ed the way we correct for liquid junction potentials (vide infra). 
Cells were plated at confl uent density on Snapwell fi lters (Corn-

steady-state transepithelial resistance and maximal induction of ex-
pression in the TetOff system. The fi lters were mounted in Ussing 
chambers stirred with gas lifts in 100% O 2 at 37 ° C, and voltage/ 
current clamped using Ag/AgCl electrodes bridged by 3 M KCl/3% 
agar pipettes. The standard Ringer solution used at baseline con-
tained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 glucose, and 10 
Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4. In general, data were acquired at 1-s intervals 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Acquire and Analyze software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Physiological Instruments</rs>). 
Conductance and voltage measurements for each condition were

The Pt L 3 -edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were obtained on the BL14W1 
beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), operated at 
3.5 GeV with injection currents of 140-210 mA. A Si (111) double-crystal mono-
chromator was used to reduce harmonic component of the monochrome beam. All 
the samples were measured in fluorescence mode. The powder of a sample was 
pressed into a self-supporting disk, which was then sealed with Kapton membrane 
and subjected to XAS measurement. The <rs type="software">IFEFFIT</rs> software was used to calibrate the 
energy scale, to correct the background signal and to normalize the intensity. Reliable 
parameters for the Z (Pt, Pt) and Z (Pt, O) contributions were determined by 
multiple-shell fitting in r space with application of k

<p>DFT calculations of the charge density around proton H

package. The exchange-correlation energy and potential were described self-
consistently within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PW91). The self-
consistent PW91 density was determined by iterative diagonalization of the 
Kohn2Sham Hamiltonian. The wave functions were expanded with the plane wave, 
and the ultra-soft pseudo-potential method was used to reduce the number of plane 
waves. Plane waves were used as a basis set with an energy cutoff of 340 eV .The 
electron density was approximated using a multipolar expansion up to hexadecapole. 
Typical overbinding associated with local density functionals was rectified through 
the use of the gradient-corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The

the mica surface sample holder with 0.1% (3-Aminopropyl) 
triethoxysilane (APTES) to stabilize the NPs (to prevent 
their collapse on the mica surface), and then performed 
the AFM analysis. Young's modulus was calculated for six

<p>Persistence with therapy was estimated at 12, 18, and 
24 months using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, with non-
persistence as the failure event. Women were censored for 
death and end of data availability (31 March 2013). Covariates 
associated with non-persistence were investigated using a 
parametric proportional hazards model (Weibull distribution). 
The effects of alternative permissible gaps of 30, 90, and 
180 days were explored using sensitivity analyses. 
Denosumab has a biannual dosing regimen and women may 
refill their prescriptions several months earlier than the date on 
which the next injection is needed, which can result in long 
gaps between prescriptions. This possible accumulation of 
denosumab was accounted for in another sensitivity analysis, 
which used a 56-day permissible gap and permitted women to 
cover future gaps between filled prescriptions with previously 
dispensed medication. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the calen-
dar year of the index denosumab injection. Further subgroup 
analyses compared persistence in treatment-naïve women 
with that in treatment-experienced women. The latter group 
was defined as those with a prescription for another anti-
osteoporosis drug (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, eti-
dronate, zoledronic acid, strontium ranelate, raloxifene, or 
parathyroid hormone analogue) in the pre-index period. 
Model distribution and covariate selection were based on 
maximizing the log-likelihood and minimizing the Akaike 
information criterion. The proportional hazards assumption 
was tested by graphical inspection and by exploring whether 
the included covariates significantly varied over time. The 
statistical analysis was executed using Stata <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">12</rs> (StataCorp

<p>prevalence level through decreases in viral load

both sets of treatment-related effects, EPP 2009 
now uses a modified Reference Group model that 
includes the impacts of ART on prevalence and 
incidence. 
Estimates of the number of persons living with 
HIV have been the major focus of routine moni-
toring and reporting on HIV epidemics. However, 
a number of problems have been identified with the 
reliance on prevalence as an indicator for analysing 
the impact of HIV programs. During the early 
phases of an epidemic prevalence grows rapidly, but 
changes in the slope due to saturation and to 
program impact are difficult to separate. After 
several years HIV prevalence tends to plateau, with 
new infections and deaths balancing each other 
out. An effective program introduced as this 
plateau phase begins may induce a gradual decline 
in prevalence, but this decline may be difficult to 
distinguish from mortality-related declines. Several 
years ago, the global epidemic entered a plateau 
phase, with most countries in sub-Saharan Afri-
cadwhere the majority of people living with HIV 
residedshowing stable or only slowly declining 
HIV prevalence. As a result, in 2007 UNAIDS began 
to focus more attention on new infections, that is, 
incidence, as a more informative measure of global 
progress. 
11 In response, the UNAIDS Reference 
Group recommended that the tools UNAIDS 
prepares to assist countries in analysing their 
epidemics, EPP and <rs type="software">Spectrum</rs>, shift to a focus on 
incidence. 
12 This change was made in the 2009 
version of the software, which still fits prevalence 
data, but provides incidence from the model along 
with prevalence as outputs. Because incidence is 
derived by fitting prevalence, it reflects an averaged 
national trend in new infections and may not 
capture short-term rises and falls in incidence 
occurring in specific groups or geographical areas. 
EPP 2009 includes a number of additional 
changes to resolve issues that have arisen in the 
application of the package at country level. EPP 
2007's uncertainty estimation procedures evaluated 
50 000e200 000 sets of Reference Group model 
parameters for their fit to the observed prevalence 
data, normally selecting out 50 or more that were 
close to the data (described in Brown et al 
5 and 
Alkema et al 
13 ). In a few countries, the defaults set 
in the uncertainty procedures produced relatively 
few unique curves, leading to inaccurate estimation 
of uncertainty. A new procedure, incremental 
mixture importance sampling (IMIS), has been 
introduced to solve this problem. In many African 
countries the population has been rapidly shifting </p>

<p>For construction of the RCAS-IRES-EGFP plasmid, cDNA sequences 
containing IRES-EGFP (nucleotide numbers 666-1973) of the 
pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) were amplified 
by PCR. Both the 5′ and 3′ PCR primers contain an artificial ClaI site, 
and the 3′ ClaI site was protected by a 5′ guanine, thus preventing 
ClaI cleavage when methylated, as previously described (McLaugh-
lin et al., 2003). The PCR product was cloned into the ClaI site of the 
replication-competent avian retroviral vector RCAS (Fekete and 
Cepko, 1993). The RCAS-Nel-IRES-EGFP vector was constructed by 
inserting the protein-coding region of Nel cDNA (GenBank acces-
sion number NM_001030740.1, nucleotide numbers 118-2565) into 
the RCAS-IRES-EGFP vector upstream of the IRES at the functional

the dark for 1.5 h and the coupling reaction was stopped by 
adding 4.5 ml of 4M hydroxylamine and 35 ml of 100 mM 
sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Labelled DNA was purified using 
a Qiaquick PCR purification column and then vacuum 
dried. Both dye-coupled DNAs were then resuspended 
together in 85 ml of DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche Diagnost-
ics) together with 5 ml of salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml) and 
denatured at 95 
C for 5 min. The hybridization mixture was 
allowed to cool briefly and 5 ml of yeast tRNA (10 mg/ml) was 
added and the mixture was held at 65 
C for 2 min and 
allowed to cool to room temperature. Hybridization to the 
microarray was carried out under a cover slip in a humidified 
chamber at 37 
C for 8 h. The cover slip was floated off in 1·

0.1% SDS at 50

at room temperature in 1· SSC and 0.1· SSC for 5 min 
each. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 r.p.m. 
for 5 min and scanned immediately using the GenePix 
4000A scanner (Axon). The settings for PMT gain were 
adjusted during the initial rapid scan to achieve a balance 
between the two channels and these settings were used for 
the high resolution scan. <rs id="software-7" type="software">GenePix</rs> <rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">version 4.1</rs> was used to

<p>Data analyses 
A ± 1-bp error in size calling from run to run 
variation and plus-A effects was observed and 
loci were binned accordingly using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Genemapper</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 4</rs>). F-statistics, migration estimates (Nm values) 
and Mantel tests were performed with <rs id="software-1" type="software">GenAlEx 
(Genetic Analyses in Excel</rs>) <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 6.5</rs> (Peakall and 
Smouse, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-date">2006</rs>; Peakall and Smouse, 2012). 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">Estimates</rs> of population diversity were calculated 
by rarefaction (which controls for unequal 
sample sizes) using EstimateS (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Colwell</rs>, 2006). </p>

<p>The maximum likelihood outcrossing rates were 
estimated in Mathematica <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">7</rs> following the method used 
by <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Johnson</rs> et al. (2004) that estimates the proportion of 
matings between spores from the same meiotic event 
(that is, that are asci mates), and those from indepen-
dent meiotic events (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">(code available at http:// goddardlab.auckland.ac.nz/data-and-code/)</rs>/). Allelic 
richness was estimated using rarefaction with HP 
rare, again controlling for unequal sample sizes, 
based on the lowest number of 94 observed alleles 
among sampled populations (Kalinowski, 2005). 
Population structure was evaluated using the 
Bayesian clustering method implemented in 
InStruct, which does not assume Hardy-Weinberg 
Equilibrium, accounts for inbreeding, and makes no 
a priori assumptions about the sampling location of 
the genotypes (Gao et al., 2007). This method 
estimates the most likely number of populations 
and assigns genotypes to these probabilistically. 
Admixture was allowed and the proportion of each 
genotype's ancestry in each inferred population was 
estimated. Three chains of one million MCMC 
iterations with a burn-in of 10 000 were run for 
K ¼ 1-25. Convergence of the MCMC chain was 
confirmed using the Gelman-Rubin statistic 
(Gelman and Rubin, 1992). Analyses of the resulting 
ancestry profiles evaluating and quantifying the 
contribution of niche and geographic region to 
population structure was conducted with <rs id="software-5" type="software">ObStruct</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Gayevskiy et al.</rs>., <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-date">2014</rs>). 
Directional migration rates were quantified using 
the Bayesian coalescent approach implemented in 
MIGRATE that assumes constant population sizes, 
random mating, a constant mutation rate and that 
populations are connected only through migration, 
not population divergence (Beerli and Felsenstein, 
2001; Beerli, 2006, 2009; Beerli and Palczewski, 
2010). Mutation-scaled population sizes (y) were 
calculated using the number of sampled alleles 
(Haasl and Payseur, 2010). We employed a Brownian 
motion allele mutation model with starting esti-
mates of the mutation-scaled migration rate derived 
from F ST calculations to estimate all possible migra-
tion routes. Chains of one million steps with a burn-
in of 50 000 were run with 10 replicates, sampling 
every 100 steps (Beerli, 2009). The analysis was run 
in parallel on the NeSI pan cluster at the University 
of Auckland. </p>

<p>are extremely low (o0.005) and insignificant 
(P40.33) with the exception of Martinborough 
(F ST ¼ 0.046, P ¼ 0.003); however, this F ST value is 
classed as only representing 'low' differentiation 
(Wright, 1978). There is complete overlap of isolates 
deriving from all niches in a principal component 
analysis of genetic distances between genotypes 
(Supplementary Figure S1) and no significant 
population differentiation between niches within 
regions using <rs type="software">InStruct</rs> and subsequent <rs type="software">ObStruct</rs> 
analyses (P40.119, Supplementary Figure S2). 
Together, this provides no substantial evidence of 
an effect of niche on population structure within 
regions. Some of the S. cerevisiae genotypes con-
tributing to spontaneous ferments may have derived 
from wineries, as opposed to the 'environment' 
(Bokulich et al., 2013). As all of these wineries 
reside within the same geographic regions the fruit 
was collected from, these potentially winery derived 
genotypes form part of the local population we wish 
to study. Thus, individuals from various niches 
within regions comprise homogenous populations, 
and so we combined all genotypes from different 
niches within regions to form regional populations 
for further analyses. </p>

<p>Quantifying geographic population structure 
<rs id="software-9" type="software">InStruct</rs> analyses (Gao et al., <rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-date">2007</rs>) indicate the 
optimal number of populations, given the data are 
16. Examination of the ancestry profile plots 
(Rosenberg, 2004) resulting from this analysis are 
indicative of population structure by region to some 
degree (for example, the blocks of green, red and 
yellow in Nelson, Central Otago and Martinborough, 
respectively) and are in agreement with the magni-
tude of the pairwise F ST estimates (Figure 1). Sub-
sequent <rs type="software">ObStruct</rs> analyses revealed that the inferred 
population structure is significantly correlated with 
geographic location (R 
2 ¼ 0.16, Po0.0001), and this 
explains about one-sixth of the genetic variability 
observed. Individuals from the Nelson and Central 
Otago regions contributed the greatest signal to 
overall population structure with significant 
decreases in the R 
2 values observed when these are 
removed (R 
2 ¼ D À 0.05 and D À 0.02, respectively). 
The R 
2 value remained constant when data from 
Martinborough were removed but increased when 
Hawke's Bay and Marlborough data were indepen-
dently removed (R 
2 ¼ D þ 0.03 for both). Increases in 
R 
2 suggest individuals from these regions add noise 
to any signal for structure (that is, have homogenised 
not localised populations). Further, canonical 
discriminant analysis shows that B80% of the 
variation in ancestry profiles can be represented 
with the first and second axes, suggesting that 
most of the variation can be visualised in these 
graphical representations of the data (Supplementary 
Figure S3). Ancestry profiles from Central Otago and 
Nelson cluster the most discretely in these plots, </p>

<p>Quantifying population connectivity and migration 
Pairwise estimates of migration between the regions 
(Nm values) using classic methods derived from F ST 
values (Hartl and Clark, 1997) suggest that 
Hawke's Bay and Marlborough are the most 
connected, closely followed by Marlborough and 
Martinborough, and Hawke's Bay and Martinbor-
ough (Figure 1). Nelson and Central Otago share the 
lowest number of migrants with an estimate of just 
one per generation (Figure 1). <rs type="software">MIGRATE</rs> analyses 
showed an acceptance ratio for each parameter 
ranging from 0.38 to 0.65, and an effective sample 
size of approximately two million, suggesting that 
the chain length was sufficient. The autocorrelation 
between parameters and the prior was high and 
estimated to be around 0.96 overall, indicating a 
lack of information in data. This is reflected in the 
high confidence intervals surrounding the estimates 
(Supplementary Table S4). However, consistent 
patterns between multiple runs were evident, 
allowing meaningful estimates of gene flow between 
regions to be made. Inferred mean rates of move-
ment between regions span an order of magnitude 
ranging from 6 to 63 migrants per generation 
(Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S4), and show 
differential inward and outward movements for 
some regions. Correlating with the classic Nm 
estimates, and the analyses of population structure, 
Nelson and Central Otago show greatest isolation 
with twofold greater rates of outward than inward 
migration, and show an average of just 51 inward 
migrants per generation, 3.2-fold less than the 
overall average inward migration rate of 164 
migrants per generation for all other regions 
(Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Conversely, 
Marlborough and the Hawke's Bay, which harbours 
some of the least distinctive and most diverse 
populations, experience some of the greatest inward 
migration rates at an average of 171 migrants per 
generation, 1.4-fold more than the average inward 
migration rate (Supplementary Table S4). In line 
with the low F ST estimates, a high degree of 
individuals with shared ancestry from <rs type="software">InStruct</rs>, 
and a large proportion of admixed individuals 
(Figure 1), Marlborough and the Hawke's Bay are 
the most connected regions, and experience an 
average of twofold more migration between these 
regions than the average overall migration rate. The 
extent of migration between regions does not 
correlate with geographic location (P40.21) show-
ing the difference in the extent of gene flow is not 
simply a function of distance. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
We analyzed comparisons of the occurrences of perverted 
nystagmus and of brain MRI abnormal findings and odds ra-
tio of several factors about occurring perverted nystagmus. 
The statistical analyses were conducted using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> soft-
ware (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 22.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA), p&lt;0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. This study was reviewed 
and approved by the Korea University Ansan Hospital Insti-
tutional Review Board (AS15068). </p>

<p>The study was descriptive-analytical, comparative, 
partly epidemiological, and mainly clinical applicative. 
The study involved all patients who meet the criteria for 
inclusion in the study. Used are the results of cytological 
and histological diagnosis in the period from January 1, 
2009 to December 31, 2011. 
In all subjects had previously done colposcopic exam-
ination and Pap test, and in patients with abnormal find-
ings was also performed cervical biopsy for obtaining his-
topathological diagnosis. 
Colposcopy was performed using the Olympus colpo-
scope. The Pap test is taken from the front and rear lip 
and cervical canal. From the sample taken is made the cy-
tological smear, which is fixed on a microscopic slide and 
stained by the method of Pap-Nikolai. After staining was 
performed microscopic analysis of morphological char-
acteristics of the cells in the course of which are detected 
signs of cervical inflammation, causes infection, benign 
and malignant cells and other pathological changes. 
After the punch biopsy changes in the cervix, the sam-
ples were forwarded to the Department of Pathology at 
the further processing. 
For statistical analysis of the data obtained was used 
software package <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> for Windows. In the analysis of the 
results obtained, the following statistical methods were 
used: for continuous variables in the study as the first 
analysis of symmetry (normality) of their distribution by 
Kolmogornov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk test. Since the 
distribution of continuous variables significantly deviated 
from normal (Gaussian) distribution, mean values and a

<p>Strain identification by MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA 
sequencing 
Among the 18 culture conditions previously selected by cul-
turomics [27], strain MC1 grew on sheep's blood-enriched 
Colombia agar (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The col-
onies were obtained by spreading samples on a solid medium. 
They were then purified by subculture and identified by 
MALDI-TOF MS [28,29]. Colonies were deposited in duplicate 
on a MTP 96 MALDI-TOF MS target plate (Bruker Daltonics, 
Leipzig, Germany), which was analysed with a Microflex spec-
trometer (Bruker). The 12 spectra obtained were matched 
against the references of the 7567 bacteria contained in the 
database by standard pattern matching (with default parameter 
settings), with <rs id="software-1" type="software">MALDI BioTyper</rs> database software <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">2.0</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">bruker</rs>). An identification score over 1.9 with a validated 
species allows identification at the species level, and a score 
under 1.7 does not enable any identification. When identifica-
tion by MALDI-TOF MS failed, the 16S rRNA was sequenced 
[30]. Stackebrandt and Ebers [31] suggest similarity levels of 
98.7% with the 16S rRNA sequence as a threshold to define a 
new species without performing DNA-DNA hybridization. </p>

<p>Genome annotation and comparison 
Genome annotation and comparison open reading frames 
(ORFs) were predicted using Prodigal [33] with default pa-
rameters, but the predicted ORFs were excluded if they 
spanned a sequencing gap region (contains N). The predicted 
bacterial protein sequences were searched against the Clusters 
of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database using BLASTP (E 
value 1e-03, coverage 70%, identity percentage 30%). If no hit 
was found, it searched against the NR database using BLASTP 
with an E value of 1e-03 coverage 70% and identity percentage 
of 30%. If sequence lengths were smaller than 80 amino acids, 
we used an E value of 1e-05. The tRNAScanSE tool [34] was 
used to find tRNA genes, whereas rRNAs were found using 
RNAmmer [35]. Lipoprotein signal peptides and the number of 
transmembrane helices were predicted using Phobius [36]. 
ORFans were identified if all the performed BLASTP proced-
ures did not give positive results (E value smaller than 1e-03 for 
ORFs with sequence size higher than 80 aa or E value smaller 
than 1e-05 for ORFs with a sequence length smaller than 80 aa). 
Such parameter thresholds have already been used in previous 
work to define ORFans. 
Genomes were automatically retrieved from the 16s RNA 
tree using <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Xegen</rs>'s <rs id="software-2" type="software">PhyloPattern</rs> software [37]. For each

The Friedman test was used to assess the significance 
of changes in blood parameters during treatment. The 
comparisons of baseline parameters between different 
groups were assessed using the χ 
2 test or Fisher's exact 
test as appropriate, or the Mann-Whitney test. A p-value 
&lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>Exclusion criteria included the prior injection of any intravitreal or systemic anti-VEGF-
compounds before the study period, sub-tenon or intraocular steroid injection, the presence 
of any other significant macular pathology such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
or vascular occlusive disorders, epiretinal membrane or vitreomacular traction, previous 
retinal surgery, history of intraocular inflammation or post-surgical macular edema and 
laser photocoagulation during the study. 
Injections were delivered following a PRN protocol. The decision of reinjection was at 
the clinician's discretion, based on the presence of persistent intraretinal fluid. 
Data collected included demographics, systemic co-morbidities, current HBA1C levels, 
previous laser treatments, ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ophthalmic findings, 
and macular central point and central subfield macular thicknesses (CST) according to OCT 
at the first and last visit.

The gels were washed with a destaining solution (3% 
glacial acetic acid) in horizontal rotators. Finally, the gels were 
washed with Milli-Q water for 30 min. Images were obtained 
by scanning the 2D gels with a PowerLook 2100XL scanner 
(UMAX Technologies, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA).

used to calculate the intensities of protein spots to identify 
differentially expressed proteins. To correct quantitative 
variations in the intensity of protein spots, spot volumes 
were normalized as a percentage of the total volume of all 
the spots present in a gel. Only spots that were consistently 
present in the gels from at least three rats in each group were 
analyzed to avoid spot differences that were due to gel-to-gel 
or biological variation inherent among the rats. The protein 
molecular weight, which ranged from 10 to 100 kDa, and 
the isoelectric point (pI), which ranged from 3 to 10, of each 
protein spot were calculated by the software using the distri-
butions of standard markers and pI positions, respectively. </p>

<p>In-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. 
Selected protein spots were excised from the gel and cut 
into ~1 mm 
2 pieces. Samples were destained using 50% 
(vv) acetonitrile (ACN) and 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate 
(100 µl, pH 8.0) for 15 min, this was repeated three times until 
the destaining process was complete. The gel samples were 
dipped into 100% ACN (30 µl, pH 8.0) for 5 min until they 
turned white. They were dried at room temperature and the 
samples were then digested using trypsin (8 µl, 0.005 mg/ml) 
at 37˚C for 16 h. The digested proteins (0.3 µl) coupled with 
0.3 µl matrix were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis 
using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) to obtain 
the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) with 4,600 laser intensity.

databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the fingerprinting 
method was applied allowing a maximum of one missed 
tryptic cleavage per protein. The protein score confidence 
calculated using the Mascot algorithm. Confidence score

<p>F-FDG was produced and provided by Skåne 
University Hospital Cyclotron Unit. For PET-imaging, mice 
were intravenously injected with approximately 30 MBq of 
FDG and were imaged 1 h after administration using a pre-
clinical PET/CT-scanner (Bioscan, USA). Mice were anaesthe-
tised using 2-3% isofluorane and were placed in a temperature 
regulated animal chamber (Minerve, Bioscan, USA) with the 
temperature set to 37 
C (Minerve multistation controller unit) 
during the scanning. During the acquisitions, respiration was 
monitored on PC (SA Instruments, Inc, USA) and anaesthesia 
levels were adjusted accordingly. CT scanning was performed 
using the X-ray exposure of 600 ms and 177 lA, and the

with 180 projections/rotation, pitch 1.0 and a binning of 1:4. 
The CT reconstruction was performed utilizing a Butterworth 
filter algorithm. The PET acquisition was performed with the 
coincidence mode set 1-3. The PET data was acquired in list 
mode for 30 minutes, and reconstructed dynamically using the 
OSEM option and rebinning SSRB to 2D LOR with the ring 
difference set to 8. CT and PET images were evaluated and 
created using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">InVivoScope</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">InviCRO</rs>). </p>

The repetition time was set between 800 and 950 ms depend-
ing on the breathing rate of the animal. The acquisition of 
the data for the 12 slices was spread over 4 respiration phases 
to achieve a T1-weighting corresponding to a repetition time 
of about 3.2-3.5 sec. Coronal and sagittal sections were 
acquired with an in plane resolution of 1563137 lm and a

<p>Data analysis 
Significant differences in ASC, DHA, and GSH contents between 
treatments (n¼3) and between root sections (n¼3) of girdled trees 
were analysed with the statistics program <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">16.0 for windows</rs> 
(Chicago, IL, USA). Prior to the test of significance with the 
Turkey test, the normality and homogeneity of the data were 
tested. Normality of the data was tested with the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test that includes correction of significance after Lilliefors 
and Shapiro-Wilk. Homogeneity of variance was tested with the 
Levene test. If homogeneity was not given, values were transferred 
using the natural logarithm. If homogeneity was still not given, the 
Games-Howell test was applied. Significant differences at P &lt;0.05 
are indicated. </p>

are scored as 0-3 points based on how well each of the 
following 5 activities are performed: lying and rolling (A), 
sitting (B), crawling and kneeling (C), standing (D), and 
walking, running, and jumping (E). 
The WeeFIM was used to evaluate the health of the pa-
tients, their developmental condition, educational level, and 
degree of local sociality. Items of the WeeFIM are scored 
as 1-7, where 1 indicates total assistance and 7 indicates 
complete independence. The lowest and highest possible 
score is 18 and 126, respectively 16) . The reliability and 
validity of the Turkish version of the WeeFIM for assessing 
the functional status in Turkish children with CP have been 
demonstrated 17, 18) . 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for Social Sciences</rs> (SPSS) for Win-
dows 19.0 software package (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs>, New York, USA) was 
used for statistical analyses of study findings. Study data 
were analyzed using statistical methods (i.e., median and 
minimum-maximum) and Wilcoxon signed rank test was 
used for intragroup comparisons of quantitative parameters 
that did not follow a normal distribution. The associations 
between GMFM-88 and WeeFIM scores were analyzed 
using Spearman correlation analysis. Results were reported 
with 95% confidence intervals and a p-value &lt;0.05 was 
considered significant. </p>

<p>Recordings were transcribed, de-identified, checked for 
accuracy, and analyzed using a general inductive approach 
to identify themes. The purpose of using an inductive ap-
proach is to derive themes organically from raw data, rather 
than using a priori hypotheses to predict outcomes. 
26 As 
transcripts became available, 2 investigators (CG and MH) 
conducted detailed readings of the transcripts to identify 
emergent themes. The analysis team discussed and refined 
these themes as a group. Thematic saturation occurred after 
reviewing and discussing 20 interviews. The themes iden-
tified were used to generate and define inductive codes. The 
transcripts were then imported into the qualitative analysis 
software <rs id="software-0" type="software">NVivo</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">10</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">QSR International Pty, Ltd</rs>, Doncaster, 
Victoria, Australia), after which the 2 investigators inde-
pendently coded the transcripts, with meetings to resolve 
discrepancies and reach consensus on preliminary and final 
codes. The researchers then identified the overarching 
theme of characteristics and role of relationships in care 
management. </p>

<p>In order to test the heterogeneity of pooled HR, Cochran's 
Q-test and Higgins I 
2 statistics were performed. P0.05 
was considered statistically significant. Random-effects 
model was used to calculate pooled HR when between-study 
heterogeneity was revealed (P0.05), and fixed-effects 
model was conducted when between-study heterogeneity 
did not reach the statistical significance (P0.05). Subgroup 
analysis, sensitive analysis, and meta-regression were used to 
investigate the sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was 
assessed by using Begg's test and Egger's test.

<p>Phosphoprotein analysis 
BG2 cells were obtained from Drosophila Genome Resource 
Center (Cell line stock number, 51), and cultured according to 
the protocol form the provider (https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/ 
include/file/general_maintenance.pdf). BG2 cells with or without 
SP treatment were lysed in protein extraction buffer containing 
50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 8 M Urea, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 1 
mM β-glycerophosphate, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM 
sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mM PMSF. After sonication, pro-
tein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein As-
say Kit (Thermo Scientific, UK). Protein samples (100 μg each) 
were chemically reduced (5 mM, DTT) and alkylated (25 mM, 
IAA) prior to trypsin digestion. After 4-fold dilution with 25 mM 
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), the protein samples were enzymatical-
ly digested using a sequencing grade trypsin at an enzyme to 
substrate ratio of 1:50 at 37°C for 16 h. Digestion reaction was 
stopped by the addition of 90% formic acid to a final concentra-
tion of 1%. Resulting tryptic digest peptide samples were de-
salted for subsequent phosphopeptide enrichment procedure. 
Phosphopeptides enriched with IMAC POROS 20 MC were 
subsequently subjected to the micro RPLC-MS/MS analysis 
described previously (Choi et al., 2011). Briefly, analyses of 
phosphopeptide-enriched samples were performed using Ag-
ilent 1100 Series high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a linear quadrupole 
ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo Finnigan, USA). The 
resulting MS/MS spectra searched against a composite protein 
database containing the <rs id="software-4" type="software">IPI mouse protein database</rs> (v.<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">3.28</rs>), 
and its reversed complement using SEQUEST algorithm (<rs type="software">Sor-
cerer system</rs>). Differential modification search options for phos-
phorylation modification (+80 on Ser, Thr, Tyr), and oxidation 
(+16 on Met), were considered in the search. 'Peptide prophet' 
and 'Protein prophet' scores of 90% was used to filter the 
search results. We applied the log2(protein ratio) from relative 
spectral counts (Rsc) for label free quantification (Old et al., 
2005). RSC = log2[(n2 + f)/(n1 + f)] + log2[(t1 -n1 + f)/(t2 -n2 + 
f)] where, for each protein, RSC is the log2 ratio of abundance 
between Samples 1 and 2; n1 and n2 are spectral counts for 
the protein in Samples 1 and 2, respectively; t1 and t2 are total 
numbers of spectra over all proteins in control and SP-treated 
samples; and ƒ is a correction factor, set to 0.5 (Beissbarth et 
al., 2004). Ammonium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, dithio-
threitol (DTT), iodoacetamide (IAA), sodium chloride, sodium 
orthovanadate (Na 3 VO 4 ), sodium fluoride (NaF), phenylmethyl-
sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), sodium β-glycerophosphate, urea and 
ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH 4 H 2 PO 4 ) were pur-
chased from Sigma (USA). Formic acid (FA) and trifluoroacetic 
acid (TFA) were obtained from Merck (Germany). HPLC grade 
acetonitrile (ACN), methanol and deionized water were all pur-
chased from Fisher Science. Sequencing grade modified tryp-
sin was obtained from Promega (USA). Aqua C18 (particle size 
5 μm) reversed-phase column material was purchased from 
Phenomenx (USA). The IMAC POROS 20 MC was purchased 
from Applied Biosystems (USA). </p>

<p>Immunohistochemistry 
We dissected ovaries in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 
7.4) and fixed them in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min 
at room temperature. After washing them with PBST, we incu-
bated them with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen, 
A11122) for 48 h at 4°C. After washing, we then incubated the 
samples for 24 h at 4°C with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat 
anti-rabbit (1:1000; Invitrogen, A11008) secondary antibody and 
an Alexa 555-conjugated phalloidin (1:1000; Invitrogen, 
A34055) to visualize actin in the muscle-rich reproductive tract. 
Finally, we mounted the tissues in Vectashield and imaged 
them with an LSM 700/Axiovert 200M confocal microscope 
(Zeiss). All confocal images are maximal intensity Z-projections. 
We performed all image processing with <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. </p>

<p>Statistics 
We used <rs id="software-2" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">5</rs> to compare experimental groups 
with multiple control groups using the ANOVA followed by Tuk-
ey's test for multiple comparisons. </p>

<p>Densitometry data were plotted as fold induction of relative density 
units, with the zero value absorbance in each figure set arbitrarily to 1 
or 100%. Statistical comparisons of absorbance differences were 
performed by the Mann-Whitney test (<rs id="software-0" type="software">Statview</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">4.5</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Abacus Concepts</rs>,

data are shown as means ± SD of at least three independent experi-
ments. </p>

<p>A randomization test on the log-rank statistic using 20,000 random samples revealed a dose-response association between overall survival

CA, carcinoma; cfu colony forming units; OS, overall survival. </p>

<p>HEK293 cells, mouse and pig retinas were lysed in RIPA buffer 
(50 m Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 m NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% Na-Deoxy-
cholate, 1 m EDTA pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS). Lysis buffers were supple-
mented with protease inhibitors (Complete Protease inhibitor 
cocktail tablets; Roche, Milan, Italy) and 1 m phenylmethylsul-
fonyl. After lysis, samples of cells containing ABCA4 were 
denatured at 37°C for 15 min in 1× Laemli sample buffer supple-
mented with 4 M urea. Lysates were separated by 6% or 8% (the 
latter used for the WB in Fig. 4C) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis. The antibodies used for immuno-blotting are as fol-
lows: anti-3×flag (1:1000, A8592; Sigma-Aldrich); anti-Filamin A 
(1:1000, catalogue #4762; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, 
MA, USA); anti-Dysferlin (1:500, Dysferlin, clone Ham1/7B6, 
MONX10795; Tebu-bio, Le Perray-en-Yveline, France). Filamin A 
and Dysferlin were used as loading controls for the in vitro and 
in vivo experiments, respectively. 
The quantification of ABCA4 bands detected by Western blot 
was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageJ</rs> software (free download available at 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</rs>/). Quantification of the Western blot ex-
periments has been performed as follows: </p>

<p>Fluorescence intensity in PR was rigorously and reproducibly 
quantified in an unbiased manner as previously described (63). 
Individual colour channel images were taken using a Leica micro-
scope (Leica Microsystems GmbH). TIFF images were gray-scaled 
with image analysis software (<rs id="software-1" type="software">LAS AF lite</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Leica Microsystems GmbH</rs>). Six images of each eye were analyzed at 20× magnifica-
tion by a masked observer. The PR (outer nuclear layer + OS) 
were selectively outlined in every image, and the total fluores-
cence for the enclosed area was calculated in an unbiased man-
ner using the image analysis software. The fluorescence in PR 
was then averaged from six images collected from separate ret-
inal sections from each eye. We then calculated the average fluor-
escence of the three eyes of each experimental group. </p>

<p>For lipofuscin fluorescence analysis, eyes were harvested from 
pigmented Abca4+/− and Abca4−/− mice at 3 months after AAV 
injection. Mice were dark-adapted over-night and sacrificed 
under dim red-light. For each eye, four overlapping pictures 
from the temporal side of three sections at different levels of 
the eye were taken using a Leica DM5000B microscope equipped 
with a TX2 filter (excitation: 560 ± 40 nm; emission: 645 ± 75) (64-
68) and under a 20× objective. The four images for each section 
were then combined in a single montage used for further fluores-
cence analysis. Intensity of lipofuscin fluorescence (red signal) in 
each section was automatically calculated using the <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> soft-
ware and was then normalized for the length of the RPE under-
lying the area of fluorescence. </p>

<p>PHEM buffer pH 6.9 (240 m PIPES, 100 m HEPES, 8 m MgCl2, 
40 m EGTA) overnight and then rinsed in 0.1 M PHEM buffer. 
Eyes were then dissected under light microscope to select the 
tyrosinase-positive portions of the eyecups. The transduced por-
tion of the eyecups were subsequently embedded in 12% gelatin, 
infused with 2.3 M sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosec-
tions (50 nm) were cut using a Leica Ultramicrotome EM FC7 
(Leica Microsystems) and extreme care was taken to align PR con-
necting cilia longitudinally. To avoid bias in the attribution of 
morphological data to the various experimental groups, counts 
of lipofuscin granules were performed by a masked operator 
(Dr Roman Polishchuk) using the <rs id="software-4" type="software">iTEM</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Olympus SYS</rs>, 
Hamburg, Germany). The 'Touch count' module of the <rs type="software">iTEM</rs> soft-
ware was used to count the number of lipofuscin granules in 
25 µm 
2 areas (at least 40) distributed randomly across the RPE </p>

<p>After 8 days of culture, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol 
for 15 min and observed by microscopy after Congo Red 
(CR) staining, following a modified protocol [12, 13] to 
allow a perfect distinction between collagen and amyloid. 
Samples were incubated in 1% CR for 40 min, washed in 
water, incubated for 10 s in 1 ml of 1% sodium hydroxide 
in 100 ml of 50% ethanol, incubated for 30 s in Mayer's 
haematoxylin, sequentially washed in 50%, 75% and 95% 
ethanol, mounted and observed under a polarized light 
microscope (Zeiss Axio Lab.A1, Arese, Milano, Italy). 
Moreover, CR birefringence was quantified in the polar-
ized images by <rs id="software-0" type="software">Photoshop</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">CSII</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Adobe Systems</rs>, 
Mountain View, CA, USA). Three 20Â fields were chosen 
as to best reflect the overall CR birefringence of cells con-
tained on the entire slide. Total black area was automat-
ically selected. Subsequently the selection was inverted to 
evidence birefringence areas. The number of birefrin-
gence pixels was extrapolated and normalized with the 
total cell number in each field. Finally, based on the ratio 
birefringent pixels/cells, the percentage of birefringence 
inhibition of each antioxidant in HGA-treated cells was 
evaluated. We also evaluated the birefringence generated 
by the cell exposition to each antioxidant compound with-
out HGA treatment. </p>

<p>was examined by Leitz Aristoplan microscope fluores-
cence (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Representative 
images were taken in specific areas of samples using 
Leica Q Fluoro Standard, <rs type="software">Leica Chantal</rs> software. The per-
centage of cells showing a high green fluorescence was 
calculated against the total number of cells in each 
sample. </p>

<p>Required software: <rs type="software">MassLynx</rs> and <rs id="software-3" type="software">Driftscope</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Waters</rs>). </p>

<p>1. Open the IM-MS spectrum using the <rs type="software">Driftscope</rs> software. 
2. From the main menu, select View and uncheck Chromatogram, Drift Time and Spectrum (optional), leaving active only the 2D map displaying 
drift time vs. m/z. 
3. From the menu bar, choose Display |Options |Display Editor Panel and adjust Intensity Threshold values to minimize background noise (in 
most cases, this setting can be defined as Min=30-40% and Max=100% counts). 
4. Choose Display |2D Map Intensity Scale, and three options will appear: Linear Scale, Log Scale and Square Root Scale. A choice of Log 
Scale (logarithmic data transform) will compress the intensity color code, and enable the simultaneous appearance of a broad range of 
intensities (as opposed to the linear and square root options, with which only the most intense peaks will become visible). 
5. From the toolbar panel, Use Selection Tool button. This option will activate the different selection options, and enable selection of the relevant 
region within the spectrum. The most precise tool is Enable Region of Interest Selections, by means of which a border may be drawn around 
the region of interest, thereby excluding all unnecessary data and noise peaks. Likewise, the Orthogonal and Band Selection options are 
useful, when the region of interest is not surrounded by redundant peaks. 
6. Once the region of interest is selected, use the Accept Current Selection command to remove unnecessary information. 
7. Export the data to <rs type="software">MassLynx</rs>, while retaining the drift time information. 
8. Within <rs type="software">MassLynx</rs>, open the chromatogram of the saved drift time spectrum, and combine the time bins. The corresponding mass spectrum 
will open automatically. 
9. Apply the smoothening function by defining the window size and number of smooth parameters (should be tuned specifically for each 
spectrum, using minimal values). 
10. Apply baseline subtraction, if necessary. 
11. Center the spectrum and measure the mass, to validate protein identity and mass accuracy. 
12. For each charge state, combine the m/z range. The corresponding drift time spectrum will automatically appear. Smooth and center the drift 
time profile, and define the drift time value by indicating the centroid of each peak. </p>

<p>Image acquisition. Two Vectra Intelligent Slide Analysis Systems 
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) were used for automated

Microbiologic sampling with a sterile 
swab was done on each child with Infec-
tions. Formulation of Nigella Sativa was 
used topically for twenty infants in the ex-
perimental group and Mupirocin for twenty 
infants in the control group. Two groups 
were selected by simple randome tech-
nique. In experimental group a drop of 
black seed extract was used topically three 
times daily on the skin lesions for 4 days. 
In control group a topical Mupirocin oint-
ment was used three times daily on the skin 
lesions for 4 days. Clinical results analyzed 
and a questionnaire was completed each 
day. Treatment in both groups was identi-
cal. Recovery identified by pediatric exam-
ination was; dry pustules with no pus or 
discharge. Pediatrician visited all neonates 
three times a day for further evaluation. 
The recovery times were recorded accord-
ing to hour. The mean of recovery times 
between the two groups were compared. 
Statistical analysis data were presented as 
means, and SD. Comparisons between 
groups were performed by using T-test, 
fisher exact test on a statistical software 
package (<rs type="software">SPSS</rs>). Differences between the 
groups considered significant, when p-
value was less than 0.05. </p>

<p>The UPLC-ESI-MS analysis was carried out using an Wa-
ters Acquity UPLC H-Class system operated with the Empow-
er software (Milford, MA, USA) and AccuTOF 
® single-reflection 
time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an ESI operated using 
the <rs id="software-1" type="software">Mass Center system</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 1.3.7b</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">JEOL</rs>, Tokyo, Japan). 
The photodiode array (PDA) detector was recorded between 
210-450 nm and the monitoring wavelength was set to 330 
nm. The Brownlee SPP C18 column (2.1 mm×75 mm i.d., 2.7 
mm, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) used was placed in a 
column oven set at 25°C. The KJ sample was dissolved in 
15% acetonitrile to a final concentration of 30 mg/mL, filtered 
using a 0.2-mm PVDF filter, and then injected into the UPLC 
system with an injection volume of 1 mL and flow rate of 0.25 
mL/min. The mobile phase was composed of a linear gradi-
ent of acetonitrile in H2O acidified with acetic acid (0.1%) and 
run as follows: 2-5% (0-2.5 min), 5-15% (2.5-10 min), 15-20% 
(10-15 min), 20-50% (15-25 min), 50-100% (25-27 min), 100% 
(27-37 min), and 100-2% (37-38 min). The operating param-
eters of the mass spectrometer were set as follows. In the 
negative ion mode, the needle electrode was set to 2000 V; 
nitrogen gas was used as the nebulizer and desolvating agent 
at flow rates of 1 and 3 L/min, respectively; and the desolvat-
ing chamber and orifice 1 temperatures were 250 and 80°C, 
respectively. The atmospheric pressure interface potentials 
for the orifice 1, ring lens, and orifice 2 were 80, 10, 5 V, re-
spectively. The mass scale calibration was performed using a 
Yokudelna calibration kit (JEOL) for ensuring accurate mass 
measurements while the scan range of the MS acquisition 
was set at m/z 100-2000. </p>

19 it banned imports of food from the countries imposing sanctions and 
made efforts to find alternative suppliers in non-participating nations. in March 2015 Russia 
prohibited Western iT firms based in Russia from bidding for state contracts (about 70% of 
their in-country revenue) if they are observing Western restrictions on doing business in 
Crimea. in November 2015 the Russian government required all state agencies to purchase 
Russian-sourced software (e.g. for spreadsheets) instead of foreign products (e.g. <rs type="software">Excel</rs>) from 
the start of 2016. in an unrelated action, but one relevant to this article, Russia imposed 
economic sanctions on Turkey (restrictions of charter flights for tourists, removal of visa-free 
travel, suspension of investment projects, a ban on hiring Turkish citizens) in late November 
2015 in response to the Turkish air force using a US-supplied F-16 to shoot down a Russian 
bomber engaged in ground attacks against Turkomen insurgents in north Syria (BBC, 2015). 
Several Russian government import-substitution policies have been supported by large 
budget allocations. Russia proceeded with the formation of the EEU in January 2015 with 
the other member states of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Russian institu-
tions have explored options for obtaining substitute finance in alternative financial centres 
in Asia (Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai). However, according to Connolly (2015b) Asia 
was the source of only 10% of loans to Russian businesses in 2015. in light of the Western 
embargo on exports of military equipment (e.g. helicopter carriers from France), Russia has

<p>. We classi-
fied %BF as proposed by Lohman 
(14) . To be included in the 
study, the adolescent's %BF should match the classification 
range by the two methods. 
To calculate the sample size, we used the software <rs id="software-0" type="software">Epi-Info</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">6.04</rs>. We considered the population of 3,608 adolescents 
in the age range and sex for the study 
(16) , the prevalence of 
excess body fat of 25% 
(17) , an acceptable variability of 11% 
and a confidence level of 95%, with minimum sample of 59 
adolescents in each group (G1 and G2), totaling a sample 
of 118 adolescents. 
For the sample selection, we chose randomly four public 
schools by convenience, located in the urban area of the muni-
cipality. Screening was performed with measurement of weight, 
height, and %BF in 560 adolescents. Of these, all students who 
met the inclusion criteria participated in the random selection 
draw. The selected adolescents from both groups underwent 
anthropometric and body composition assessments.

<p>The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) captures the antidisciplinary ethos 
of the MIT Media Lab. Like the Lab, it opens new connections between 
science and design, encouraging discourse that breaks down the barriers 
between traditional academic disciplines. It explores not only the design 
of science, but also the science of design. 
With this innovative approach, JoDS intends to incite much-needed 
change in academic publishing by challenging traditional academic silos 
as well as the established publishing practices associated with them. 
The journal is hosted on an open-access, open-review, rapid 
publication platform called <rs id="software-3" type="software">PubPub</rs>, created by students at the <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Media Lab</rs>. PubPub is a collaborative publication environment with rich 
commenting features, and powerful, intuitive authoring tools. JoDS 
articles are authored directly within the PubPub environment, which 
provides support for multimedia, image integration, and large data sets. 
Unlike journals that operate within a formal peer review system and 
rigid disciplinary framework, JoDS invites jargon-free communication 
across all fields of design and science, unconventional formats, and 
widespread community participation. JoDS empowers authors to engage 
in fruitful, ongoing discussion about their work with members of many 
different communities, both within and outside of their home disciplines. 
This rich, peer-to-peer approach to review provides for a much broader

<p>Statistical analysis 
In a case-control study, cases and controls ideally match on all 
characteristics except the variable of interest. In order to con-
sider the confounding effects of unmatched characteristics, we 
treated them as covariates in a multiple logistic regression 
analysis. Variables with P values less than 0.2 for differences 
between the two groups were considered to be covariates: these 
included age, marital status, literacy, hypertension, and hyper-
lipidemia. Results were reported as mean±standard deviation 
for quantitative variables and percentages for categorical vari-
ables. The groups were compared using the Student's t-test for 
continuous variables and the chi-square test (or Fisher's exact 
test as appropriate) for categorical variables. Odds ratios (OR) 
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for OR were calculated. To 
decrease the effects of probable confounders, adjusted ORs 
were estimated when appropriate. Results for which P values 
were 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. All 
the statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 13.0</rs> 
for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). </p>

<p>Analysis of β-glucan synthase gene structure. The 
exon arrangement of the S. crispa β-glucan synthase gene was 
analyzed by <rs id="software-2" type="software">FGENESH</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://linux1.softberry.com</rs>/) 
[21] using Coprinopsis cinerea genome as a reference. 
Transmembrane domain of the β-glucan synthase protein 
was analyzed by <rs id="software-3" type="software">Phobius</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">http://phobius.sbc.su.se</rs>/) 
[22]. Phylogenetic analysis with the fungal β-glucan 
synthases was conducted using <rs id="software-4" type="software">MEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">ver. 2.0</rs> software. </p>

<p>comparison analysis of multiple fungal β-glucan synthase 
genes revealed that the determined sequence was incomplete, 
lacking approximately 400 bp at the 3' end region. The β-
glucan synthase gene was analyzed by the <rs type="software">FGENESH</rs> 
program to predict the open reading frame using the C. 
cinerea genome as the reference. As a result, the β-glucan 
synthase gene was found to consist of 10 exon sequences 
separated by nine introns. The predicted size of the mRNA 
was 4,728 bp. The mRNA encoded a polypeptide consisting 
of 1,576 amino acid residues. Since mushroom β-glucan 
synthases of this type are generally composed of 1,6401 
,650 amino acid residues, the S. crispa β-glucan synthase 
in this study is estimated to be devoid of approximately 70 
amino acids at its C-terminus. However, the protein 
regions critical for enzyme function, including the active 
site, are mostly contained within the 1,500 amino acid 
residues for fungal β-glucan synthase [5]. The amino acid 
sequence for S. crispa β-glucan synthase is estimated to 
carry most of the information required for the analysis of 
enzyme function. </p>

<p>Domain analysis for S. crispa β-glucan synthase. 
Fungal β-glucan synthase is an integral membrane protein, 
consisting of two cytosolic and two transmembrane domains 
[1, 23]. Topology of S. crispa β-glucan synthase was analyzed 
by the <rs type="software">Phobius</rs> program to predict the functional domain 
regions. As shown in Fig. 2A, S. crispa β-glucan synthase </p>

cessful through quantitative fluoresent PCR (QF-PCR) assays and small tandem 
repeat (STR) markers. The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical 
feasibility for rapid prenatal detection of Down syndrome using the quantitative flu-
orescent PCR in uncultured amniocytes. DNA was extracted from uncultured amni-
otic fluid of normal karyotype (n=200) and of Down syndrome (n=21). It was ampli-
fied using QF-PCR with four STR markers located on chromosome 21. Among 
normal samples, the ranges of diallelic peaks for at least one STR marker were 
1.0-1.3 for D21S11, 1.0-1.4 for D21S1411 and 1.0-1.5 for D21S1270. Down syn-
drome samples showed trisomic triallelic patterns or trisomic diallelic patterns. The 
sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of the assay for detecting Down syndrome 
were 95.4%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. Rapid prenatal diagnosis of Down 
syndrome using QF-PCR is a reliable technique that aids clinical management of

<p>fixed with 4% PFA (1X PBS) for 10 min. The slides were 
then washed thrice in 0.05% Triton X-100 (1X PBS) for 5 
min each time and cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton 
X-100 (1X PBS) for 10 min. For FLAG Immuno-FISH, 
FISH was done before immunostaining. The slides were 
incubated in 20% glycerol (1X PBS) for 30 min and then 
freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen 4 times. The slides were 
again washed in 0.05% Triton X-100 (3 × 5 min). Depuri-
nation was carried out in 0.1 N HCl for 10 min and again 
washing was done for 3 × 5 min in 0.05% Triton X-100. 
Equilibration was carried out in 2X SSC for 5 min and then 
in 50% formamide (2X SSC) over night at room tempera-
ture. Slides were denaturated in 70% and 50% formamide 
for 3 min and 1 min, respectively, at 73 
• C. A total of 10 l 
of labeled total human chromosome specific DNA probes 
(Applied Spectral imaging) was denatured for 7 min at 
80 
• C, re-annealed at 37 
• C for 20 min and hybridized onto 
the slides for 2-3 days at 37 
• C. Post hybridization, washes 
were done at 73 
• C in 0.4X SSC (3 × 3 min) and 4X SSC 
with 0.1% Tween20 (3 × 3 min). Immunostaining for the 
FLAG tag was done as described earlier in order to identify 
the H2AX construct expressing cells. The slides were then 
stained with TO-PRO-3 (Life Technologies) and confocal 
images with stacks of 0.3 m optical sections of at least 
30 nuclei (in 2 independent experiments), were obtained us-
ing a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510) at 
100x magnification. The distance between the nuclear cen-
tre and the centre of the chromosome territory (centre here 
refers to the center of mass) was measured using <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Bitplane</rs> 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">Imaris</rs> software. 
For NM1 Immuno-FISH, immunostaining was done be-
fore FISH. All the steps were same as described above. Af-
ter immunostaining, the cells were fixed by using 4% PFA 
for 10 min, washed with PBS and then subjected to all the 
FISH steps, starting with incubation in 20% glycerol and fi-
nally the cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting media 
containing DAPI. </p>

<p>2D-FISH was performed using a protocol described earlier 
(46). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and the pellet was resus-
pended in hypotonic 0.075 M KCl solution. This was fol-
lowed by their fixation in 3:1(v/v) methanol: acetic acid. 
Cells were dropped on slides and subjected to sequential 
70%, 90%, 100% ethanol treatment. Denaturation was per-
formed at 70 
• C for 2 min in 70% formamide (2X SSC). 
Ten microliters of labeled human chromosome DNA probe 
(Applied Spectral Imaging) that had been denatured at 
80 
• C for 7 min and re-annealed at 37 
• C for 20 min, was 
applied to the denatured cells. Hybridization was done at 
37 
• C overnight. Post hybridization, washes were performed 
at 72 
• C in 0.4X SSC (3 × 3 min) and 4X SSC with 0.1% 
Tween20 (3 × 3 min). Cells were mounted in Vectashield 
containing DAPI. At least 100 nuclei were imaged on a Zeiss 
Axiovert 200 microscope at 100x magnification and pro-
cessed through the software package <rs type="software">IMACULAT</rs> (76,77) 
for quantitation of the probe signal. One-way ANOVA and 
t-tests were performed. </p>

<p>A previously described nuclear fractionation protocol was 
used (78). Cells (1 × 10 
6 ) were resuspended in buffer A [10 
mM HEPES (pH = 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, 1 
mM DTT, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] and were 
incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were collected in the pel-
let fraction by centrifuging at 1300 g, 4 min, 4 
• C. The nuclei 
were washed once with buffer A, followed by the addition 
of buffer B [3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 
1X protease inhibitor cocktail] for 10 min to lyse the nu-
clei. Centrifugation at 1700 g, 4 min, 4 
• C was used to col-
lect the insoluble chromatin fraction in the pellet and the 
nuclear soluble fraction (NS) in the supernatant. The pel-
let was washed once with buffer B and centrifuged again. 
The final chromatin enriched pellet (CP) was dissolved in 
Laemmli buffer and sonicated thrice (15 s pulse) using a 
Branson sonicator. 
For salt extraction, chromatin pellets from cells were in-
cubated in 200, 400 and 800 mM NaCl containing buffer B, 
kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 10 min. 
Equal volumes of supernatant (soluble fraction) and pellet 
were loaded on the gel for subsequent Western blotting. 
For whole cell lysates, cells were washed with 1X PBS 
twice. The pellet was resuspended in 1X RIPA buffer con-
taining protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and incubated 
on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 14 000 r. p. 
m. for 10 min at 4 
• C. 
Protein concentrations were determined by using the 
BCA assay (Pierce BCA kit) and 30 g of protein was 
used for immunoblotting. Western blotting of the nu-
clear soluble (NS) and the CP fractions was done by 
separating the proteins on a SDS PAGE gel (8% re-
solving gel for NM1, INO80, ALDHIAI and 15% re-
solving gel for H2AX, FLAG, actin) and blotting onto 
PVDF membrane. The membrane was then probed with 
antibodies for Nuclear myosin1␤ [for detecting NM1] 
(Sigma-Aldrich), actin (Sigma-Aldrich), ␣-Tubulin (Sigma-
Aldrich), FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), INO80 (Abcam), ALD-
HIAI (Abcam), Rad51 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), H2AX 
(Abcam), GSK3␤ (Cell Signaling) or PhosphoSer9GSK3␤ 
(Cell Signaling) as mentioned in the figure legends. NM1, 
INO80 or actin levels in the nuclear fractions were quan-
tified using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software, by normalizing the Western 
blot band intensity with the total coomassie protein load 
intensity (after subtracting the equivalent background of 
the blank) for the fraction and plotted as fold change. Total 
coomassie protein load was used as a loading control (79-
81) instead of conventional loading controls such as actin, 
tubulin because we observed changes in actin (Supplemen-
tary Figure S4: Panel E) and tubulin levels in the nuclear 
fractions upon DNA damage. Because of this observed vari-
ability, we could not use these markers as reliable loading 
controls. Histones also could not be used as a loading con-
trol in the Western blots for the nuclear fractionation ex-
periments as they showed up in only the chromatin pellet 
fraction and not in the nuclear soluble fraction. For whole 
cell lysates, ␣-tubulin was used as a loading control. </p>

<p>Context: Junior doctors are reported to make most of the prescribing errors in the hospital setting. 
Aims: The aim of the following study is to determine the knowledge intern doctors have about prescribing errors 
and circumstances contributing to making them. 
Settings and Design: A structured questionnaire was distributed to intern doctors in National Hospital Abuja 
Nigeria. 
Subjects and Methods: Respondents gave information about their experience with prescribing medicines, 
the extent to which they agreed with the definition of a clinically meaningful prescribing error and events that 
constituted such. Their experience with prescribing certain categories of medicines was also sought. 
Statistical Analysis Used: Data was analyzed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS</rs>) software 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 17</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc Chicago</rs>, Ill, USA). Chi-squared analysis contrasted differences in proportions; P &lt; 0.05 was 
considered to be statistically significant. 
Results: The response rate was 90.9% and 27 (90%) had &lt;1 year of prescribing experience. 17 (56.7%) 
respondents totally agreed with the definition of a clinically meaningful prescribing error. Most common reasons 
for prescribing mistakes were a failure to check prescriptions with a reference source (14, 25.5%) and failure 
to check for adverse drug interactions (14, 25.5%). Omitting some essential information such as duration of 
therapy (13, 20%), patient age (14, 21.5%) and dosage errors (14, 21.5%) were the most common types of 
prescribing errors made. Respondents considered workload (23, 76.7%), multitasking (19, 63.3%), rushing 
(18, 60.0%) and tiredness/stress (16, 53.3%) as important factors contributing to prescribing errors. Interns 
were least confident prescribing antibiotics (12, 25.5%), opioid analgesics (12, 25.5%) cytotoxics (10, 21.3%) 
and antipsychotics (9, 19.1%) unsupervised. 
Conclusions: Respondents seemed to have a low awareness of making prescribing errors. Principles of rational 
prescribing and events that constitute prescribing errors should be taught in the practice setting. </p>

<p>Each questionnaire used in this study was coded for 
easy reference. The data obtained was analyzed with 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 17</rs> in terms of demographic characteristics, 
qualification, current and previous posting and prescribing 
experience using frequencies and percentages as appropriate. 
Chi-square test was adopted in estimating possible differences 
in proportions. At a confidence interval of 95%, a 2-tailed 
P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be significant. </p>

<p>One of the earliest examples for sensitivity analysis in the evaluation context can 
be found in Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983a). They propose to assess the sensitivity 
of ATE with respect to assumptions about an unobserved binary covariate that is 
associated both with the treatment and the response. The basic idea is that treatment 
is not unconfounded given the set of observable characteristics X but would be 
unconfounded given X and an unobservable covariate U. Based on different sets of 
assumptions about the distribution of U and its association with D and the outcomes 
Y (0) and Y (1) it is then possible to check the sensitivity of the results with respect 
to variations in these assumptions. 
Imbens (2003) builds on this approach but does not formulate the sensitivity in 
terms of coefficients on the unobserved covariate and rather presents the sensitivity 
results in terms of partial R 
2 s. This eases the interpretation and additionally allows 
a comparison of the partial R 
2 s of the unobserved covariates to those for the 
observed covariates in order to facilitate judgements regarding the plausibility of 
values necessary to substantially change results obtained under exogeneity. Both 
approaches use a parametric model as the basis for estimating ATEs. Parametrization 
is not needed, however, in the following two approaches. 
The first approach was proposed by Rosenbaum (2002) and has been recently 
applied in Aakvik (2001), DiPrete and Gangl (2004) and Caliendo et al. (2007). 
The basic question to be answered here is whether inference about treatment effects 
may be altered by unobserved factors. In other words, one wants to determine how 
strongly an unmeasured variable must influence the selection process in order to 
undermine the implications of matching analysis. To do so it is assumed that the 
participation probability π i is not only determined by observable factors (x i ) but 
also by an unobservable component (u i ): π i = Pr(D i = 1 | x i ) = F(βx i + γ u i ). γ 
is the effect of u i on the participation decision. Clearly, if the study is free of hidden 
bias, γ will be zero and the participation probability will solely be determined by x i . 
However, if there is hidden bias, two individuals with the same observed covariates 
x have differing chances of receiving treatment. Varying the value of γ allows the 
researcher to assess the sensitivity of the results with respect to 'hidden bias'. Based 
on that, bounds for significance levels and confidence intervals can be derived. 
(For details see Rosenbaum (2002) and Aakvik (2001). Becker and Caliendo (2007) 
provide an implementation in <rs type="software">Stata</rs>). 
A different approach was recently proposed by Ichino et al. (2006). It additionally 
allows assessment of the sensitivity of point estimates and specifically the sensitivity 
of ATT matching estimates. They derive point estimates of the ATT under different </p>

<p>The bulk of software tools to implement matching and estimate treatment effects is 
growing and allows researchers to choose the appropriate tool for their purposes. The 
most commonly used platform for these tools is <rs type="software">Stata</rs> and we will present the three 
most distributed ones here. Becker and Ichino (2002) provide a programme for PSM 
estimators (pscore, attnd, attnw, attr, atts, attk) which includes estimation routines for 
NN, kernel, radius, and stratification matching. To obtain standard errors the user can 
choose between bootstrapping and the variance approximation proposed by Lechner 
(2001a). Additionally the authors offer balancing tests (blocking, stratification) as 
discussed in Section 3.4. 
Leuven and Sianesi (2003) provide the programme <rs type="software">psmatch2</rs> for implementing 
different kinds of matching estimators including covariate and propensity score 
matching. It includes NN and caliper matching (with and without replacement), KM, 
radius matching, LLM and Mahalanobis metric (covariate) matching. Furthermore, 
this programme includes routines for common support graphing (psgraph) and 
covariate imbalance testing (pstest). Standard errors are obtained using bootstrapping 
methods. 
Finally, Abadie et al. (2004) offer the programme nnmatch for implementing 
covariate matching, where the user can choose between several different distance 
metrics. Variance approximations as proposed by Abadie and Imbens (2006a) are 
implemented to obtain standard errors of treatment effects. </p>

<p>In order to manage phytosanitary risks in an ever growing and 
increasingly dynamic import and export market, the EU 7th 
Framework Program funded the Quarantine Barcoding of Life 
project to develop a quick, reliable and accurate DNA barcode-
based diagnostic tool for selected species on the EPPO A1/A2 
lists and EU Council Directive 2000/29/EC (www.QBOL.org). 
There are currently almost 350 pest and quarantine organ-
isms, covering bacteria, phytoplasmas, fungi, parasitic plants, 
insects and mites, nematodes, virus and virus-like organisms 
on the EPPO A1 (currently absent from the EPPO region) and 
A2 (locally present but controlled in the EPPO region) lists of 
organisms that require standardised protocols against introduc-
tion into, and spread within, the EPPO region. Under QBOL, 
informative loci from the selected quarantine species and their 
taxonomically related species were subjected to DNA barcoding 
from voucher specimens in order to produce reliable DNA bar-
code sequences that are made publicly available through an 
online and searchable database called <rs id="software-33" type="software">Q-bank</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-33" type="url">www.q-bank.eu</rs>) (Bonants et al. 2010). Within the QBOL project, the CBS-
KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (Utrecht, The Netherlands), 
was tasked with barcoding the Mycosphaerella complex (order 
Capnodiales, class Dothideomycetes) on the EPPO A1/A2 lists 
and their taxonomically related closest sister species (Table 1). </p>

<p>Most of the DNA used during this study were isolated from pure 
cultures that were either available at, or were made available 
to, the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, the 
Netherlands (CBS). Reference strains were either maintained 
in the culture collection of CBS, the Ministry of Agriculture, For-
estry and Fisheries of Japan culture collection (MAFF) and/or 
at the LNPV -Mycologie, Malzéville, France (LNPV) (Table 1). 
Fresh collections were made from leaves of diverse hosts by 
placing material in damp chambers for 1-2 d. Single conidial 
colonies were established from sporulating conidiomata on Petri 
dishes containing 2 % malt extract agar (MEA) as described 
earlier by Crous et al. (1991). Colonies were sub-cultured onto 
potato-dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), MEA (Crous 
et al. 2009b), and pine needle agar (PNA) (Lewis 1998), and 
incubated at 25 °C under continuous near-ultraviolet light to 
promote sporulation. Morphological descriptions are based on 
slide preparations mounted in clear lactic acid from colonies 
sporulating on PNA. Observations were made with a Zeiss V20 
Discovery stereo-microscope, and with a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 
light microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) il-
lumination and an <rs type="software">AxioCam MRc5 camera and software</rs>. Colony 
characters and pigment production were noted after 1 mo of 
growth on MEA, PDA and OA (Crous et al. 2009b) incubated 
at 25 °C. Colony colours (surface and reverse) were rated 
according to the colour charts of Rayner (1970). Sequences 
derived in this study were lodged with <rs type="software">GenBank</rs>, the alignments 
in <rs id="software-36" type="software">TreeBASE</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-36" type="url">www.treebase.org</rs>), and taxonomic novelties in 
<rs id="software-37" type="software">MycoBank</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-37" type="url">www.MycoBank.org</rs>) (Crous et al. 2004a). </p>

<p>A basic alignment of the obtained sequence data was first done 
using MAFFT <rs corresp="#software-29" type="version-number">v.6</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-29" type="url">http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html</rs> (Katoh et al. 2002) and if necessary, manually improved 
in <rs id="software-30" type="software">BioEdit</rs> <rs corresp="#software-30" type="version-number">v.7.0.5.2</rs> (Hall 1999). Bayesian analyses (critical 
value for the topological convergence diagnostic set to 0.01) 
were performed on the individual loci using MrBayes <rs corresp="#software-31" type="version-number">v.3.2.1</rs> 
(Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist 2001) as described by Crous et al. 
(2006b). Suitable models were first selected using Models of 
nucleotide substitution for each gene as determined using 
MrModeltest (Nylander 2004), and included for each gene 
partition. The substitution models for each locus are shown in 
Table 3. Teratosphaeria nubilosa (CPC 12243) was used as 
outgroup for all phylogenetic analyses. </p>

<p>Inter-and intraspecific distances for each individual dataset 
were calculated using MEGA <rs corresp="#software-32" type="version-number">v.4.0</rs> (Tamura et al. 2007) using 
the Kimura-2-parameter (pair-wise deletion) model. </p>

<p>Fig. 1 Subset of Bayesian 50 % majority rule consensus trees of the individual test loci incorporating all Mycosphaerellaceae quarantine species (marked in 
grey) and their closest neighbour species as determined from the full-scale individual loci trees containing the complete dataset (available as supplementary 
data in <rs type="software">TreeBASE</rs>). The following abbreviations were used for the genera: T = Teratosphaeria, M = Mycosphaerella, Ph = Phaeophleospora, P = Pseudocer 
cospora, D = Dothistroma and S = Septoria. A stop rule (set to 0.01) for the critical value for the topological convergence diagnostic was used for the Bayesian 
analyses. The trees were all rooted to Teratosphaeria nubilosa (CPC 12243). The scale bar indicates 0.1 expected changes per site. </p>

<p>The ITS locus is the prime candidate for the primary locus. 
ITS has recently been proposed as one of the primary fungal 
barcoding loci (Schoch et al. 2012). ITS sequencing data is 
easily obtained and a good starting point to rapidly identify 
genera and sometimes species. If an unknown genus or spe-
cies is not represented in a curated database such as <rs type="software">Q-bank</rs>, 
a <rs type="software">GenBank</rs> blast could be used to supplement these curated 
databases. Mycology has a long history of using ITS data to 
identify fungal species and <rs type="software">GenBank</rs> would thus be a good 
supplementary (although not completely curated) database. 
The use of ITS as the primary locus, and if necessary using a 
secondary locus following a molecular decision protocol, would 
be the most stable approach for a reliable identification. This 
is also the identification protocol as it is currently implemented 
in <rs type="software">Q-bank</rs>. </p>

<p>tinuous variable with the odds ratio scaled to reflect a 10-year 
difference in age (4). Although we found the association 
between parental age and autism risk to be similar across 
the 10 sites, to adjust for potential site-to-site variability we 
included site dummy variables in all multivariable models. 
To evaluate interaction or modifying effects of each covariate 
and of ASD subtypes on the associations between parental 
age and ASD, we performed stratified analyses. We also tested 
interaction terms for maternal age by paternal age and 2-way 
and 3-way interaction terms for each parent's age by the other 
covariates in the regression models, but we identified no 
significant interactions. <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.1.3</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute, Inc.</rs>., Cary, North Carolina) was used for all statis-
tical analyses. 
This research involved secondary analysis of deidentified 
data and was approved by the University of Wisconsin 
Institutional Review Board. </p>

<p>The statistical analysis was performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.2</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Inc.</rs>., Cary, NC, USA). The data was expressed as the mean ± 
SD, median (range), or number of patients. The sample size was 
based on a previous study [3] which had a three-dermatome dif-
ference in maximal block height with an alpha error of 0.05 and 
a power of 90%. Twenty-two patients per group were necessary 
to demonstrate statistical significance. To compare variables be-
tween the two groups, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to 
identify the variables with a normal distribution. Variables with 
a normal distribution were compared by independent t-tests </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed for statistical significance using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">13.0</rs> software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-square test was applied 
to the examination of relationship between PDCD4 expression levels and 
clinicopathological characteristics. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-
Meier method. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards method was used for 
analyzing the relationship between the variables and patient's survival time. The 
relationship between PDCD4 and miR-184 expression was explored by Pearson 
test. Two-tailed Student's t test was used for comparisons of two independent 
groups. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups 
for all in vitro analyses. A P-value of o0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>We demonstrate this method using panel data collected 
from 43 smallholder rice producers in the Tarlac region of 
the Philippines from 1990 to 1997. This data set is published 
as a supplement to Coelli et al. (2005). 
9 The data include 
one output (tons of freshly threshed rice) and three inputs: 
area planted (in hectares), labour used (in man-days of 
family and hired labour), and fertilizer used (in kg of active 
ingredients). We explain technical inefficiency according to 
the education of the household head (in years) and the 
percentage of area classified as ''bantog'' (upland) fields. 
All estimations and calculations have been done within 
the ''<rs id="software-8" type="software">R software environment for statistical computing and

<p>Results 
In an initial run of our <rs type="software">PERL</rs> pipeline for the three search strategies 
described above, we identified genome-wide a total of 260 prelim-
inary informative Alu and Alu-like loci, 200 preliminary LINE loci, 
and 120 preliminary LTR loci. All of these loci were then subjected to 
careful manual inspections of the insertion sites, looking for only 
those with exact orthologous insertions according to the criteria 
explained below. Only 19 Alu-like, 22 LINE, and 63 LTR loci with 
retroposed elements present in both tarsier 1 human fulfilled these 
criteria (Supplementary Information; Figure 2); none were found 
with shared elements in either strepsirrhines 1 human or tarsier

<p>Mice. Four-to six-week-old NOD mice (male and female; Taconic Laborato-
ries, Germantown, NY), female nonobese resistant (NOR) mice, male C57BL/6 
mice, and female C57BL/10SnJ mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) 
were used. Animals were housed in the barrier facility at the Institute for 
Cellular Therapeutics (Louisville, KY) and were cared for according to 
National Institutes of Health animal care guidelines. 
Antibodies. All monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in this study were 
purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). c-Kit

Ϫ cells were sorted by using CD8␣ 
APC, ␤-TCR FITC, ␥␦-TCR FITC, NK1.1 PE, and DX5 PE. 
Sorting of HSCs and FCs. HSCs and FCs were isolated from bone marrow 
by multiparameter, live sterile cell sorting (FACSVantage SE; Becton Dickin-
son, Mountainview, CA), as previously described (4). Briefly, bone marrow 
was isolated and collected in a single cell suspension at a concentration of 
100 ϫ 10 
6 cells/ml in sterile cell sort media, containing sterile 1ϫ Hank's 
balanced salt solution without phenol red, 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
serum, 10 mmol ⅐ l 
Ϫ1 ⅐ ml 
Ϫ1 HEPES buffer, and 30 l/ml gentamicin (Gibco, 
Grand Island, NY). Directly labeled mAbs were added at saturating concen-
trations, and the cells were incubated for 30 min and washed with cell sort 
media. 
Phenotypic analysis of sorted CD8 
؉ /TCR 
؊ FCs. Sorted FCs (purity was 
Ն95%) were incubated with Fc receptor block (anti-CD16/CD32) before 
staining with lineage-specific markers: anti-CD11 FITC, CD11b APC, CD14 
FITC, NK1.1 FITC, DX5 FITC, B220 PerCP, Gr-1 APC, and CD19 APC, as 
previously described (4). Sorted FCs were analyzed for p-preDC FCs as

ϩ /CD11b 
Ϫ using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Cell Quest</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Becton Dickinson</rs>). 
DC maturation and cytokine production. FCs were cultured alone or with 
1 mol/l TLR-9 ligand CpG-ODN 1668 (TCCATGACGTTCCGATGCT) (Gibco 
BRL Custom Primers) (13) for 18 h. Supernatants were assayed for cytokines 
by Linco Diagnostic (St Charles, MO) using LINCOplex Multiplex immunoas-
say, and cells were stained with anti-CD80, anti-CD86, or anti-MHC class II 
I-A 
d (39-10-8) FITC mAbs, with appropriately matched isotype controls. 
HSC and/or FC transplantation. In the syngeneic model, recipients were 
conditioned with 950 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) from a Cesium source 
(Nordion, ON, Canada) and transplanted with 500 HSCs Ϯ 30,000 FC 
populations by tail vein injection Ն6 h after irradiation (14). In the allogeneic 
model, recipients conditioned with 950 cGy TBI were transplanted with 5,000 
HSCs Ϯ 30,000 FL-PB FCs (4). 
Colony-forming cell assay. HSCs were cultured at a 1:2 ratio with or without 
FCs in methylcellulose containing mouse growth factors (MethoCult GF 
M3434; StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) in duplicate at 37°C 
in 5% CO 2 and a humidified atmosphere (13). After 14 days, colonies 
containing more than 50 cells were scored. 
Chimerism testing. Engraftment of donor cells was evaluated by PBL typing 
using three-color flow cytometry, as previously described (15). 
FC morphology. Wright-Giemsa staining was performed on cytospins of 
100,000 FCs after being fixed in methanol. Slides were examined for dendritic 
morphology under optical microscopy. 
Statistical analysis. Experimental data were evaluated for significant differ-
ences using Student's t test; P Ͻ 0.05 was considered significant. Graft survival 
was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method (4). </p>

<p>For determination of the relative motilities (relative 
molecular weight [M r ]), marker polypeptides were also 
electrophoresed with protein samples, in a non contiguous 
lane to avoid contaminations, and blotted to nitrocellulose, 
namely: rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine 
serum albumin (66.2 kDa), hen egg-white albumin (45 kDa), 
bovine carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin 
inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and hen egg white lysozyme (14.4 kDa) 
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Densitometer 
tracings of the unstained polyacrylamide gel at 280 nm were 
obtained by a Photovolt Densitometer Model 520 A 
(Photovolt Corporation, New York, NY). The absolute 
integrated optical density of each band was analyzed by 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">GelPro analyzer</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">MediaCybernetics</rs>, Silver Spring, 
MD), which allowed to calculate the molecular weight of the 
unknown bands in the CB samples. </p>

radioisotope. Upon laser-induced stimulation, light was 
emitted from the storage phosphor screen in proportion to the 
amount of radioactivity in the sample. Wide linear dynamic 
range (5 orders of magnitude) enables quantitation and 
visualization of both weak and strong signals in a single 
exposure. After digitalization of the results, the screen was 
exposed to extra-bright light of ImageEraser light box and 
reused. A laser scanning densitometer (GS-250 Molecular 
Imager System; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was 
used to convert the radioactive signals emitted by the 
immunoreactive areas on the phosphor screen into 
digital images for subsequent densitometric analysis by the 
software package <rs id="software-1" type="software">Phosphor Analyst</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Bio-Rad Laboratories</rs>, 
Hercules, CA) [14]. The radioactive signal emitted by 
unloaded parallel lanes in the same gel was considered as 
background. CA-II quantitation was performed 4 independent 
experiments. </p>

<p>Results for cytotoxicity, caspase-3/7 and 
PE-annexin V/7-AAD were expressed as mean ± S.D. 
The in vivo anti-tumor activity was expressed as mean 
± S.E.M. The significance of the differences of the 
means was determined by one way ANOVA, fol-
lowed by Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test.

Practice (GCP) conditions and passed a GCP-inspection by the 
EMA in August 2013 (2013/014). In addition it forms part of

Samples were available from 79 out of 84 participating patients. 
Samples were analyzed flow cytometrically within 30 months 
of collection, with a median time until analysis of 15 months. 
The frozen PBMC samples were thawed quickly and washed in 
warm medium. Samples were first stained with LIVE/DEAD 
Fixable Yellow Stain (Invitrogen) in PBS. After washing, cells 
were stained with a cocktail of antibodies in PBS containing 
0.5% BSA and 0.1% EDTA. The following anti-human mono-
clonal antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (Stock-
holm, Sweden): anti-CD3-FITC (clone: HIT3a), CD4-APCH7 
(RPA-T4), CD8-PerCpCy5.5 (SK1), CD16-V450 (3G8) 
CD56-APC (B159). The antibodies to NCRs NKp30-PE 
(AF29-4D12), NKp46-APC (9E2) were purchased from Milte-
nyi Biotec. Samples were collected via a 4-laser BD LSRFortessa 
SORP (405, 488, 532, and 640 nm; BD Biosciences). Data were 
analyzed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">FACSDiva</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 6</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">BD Biosciences</rs>) or

were analyzed. If an analysis failed according to pre-defined crite-
ria (experimental failure, few cells, below 25% cellular viability), 
a second sample was thawed for re-analysis. In 18 cases for 
C1D1 samples and in 12 cases for C1D21 samples, also the sec-
ond attempt failed to generate data, and these samples were

<p>cells/well in EC medium with supplements for 24 h and then cultured in EC 
medium without supplements but containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (starva-
tion medium) for an additional 24 h (basal control) or stimulated with either 
VEGF-A (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, London, U.K.) in starvation medium or MSC-
conditioned medium (supernatant from 24-h MSC cultures in starvation 
medium). [ 
3 H]thymidine incorporation (at 20 -24 h) was determined by liquid 
scintillation counting. Triplicate samples were assayed in three individual 
experiments. A mixture of 25 ϫ 10 
3 CT green-labeled MSCs and 25 ϫ 10 
3 CT 
orange-labeled ECs were cocultured in eight-well glass culture slides (Becton 
Dickinson) with EC medium and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after 
3 days. 
Coating of islets of Langerhans with ECs and MSCs. Islets of Langerhans 
(10,000 -30,000 islet equivalents) were incubated within 2-5 days after isola-
tion with 0.5 ϫ 10 
6 CT orange-labeled ECs (EC islets) or with 0.25 ϫ 10 
6 CT 
green-labeled MSCs in combination with 0.25 ϫ 10 
6 CT orange-labeled ECs 
(EC-MSC islets) in a total volume of 500 l. The cell suspensions were 
incubated at 37°C for 2-3 h in suspension culture tubes in EC medium and 
mixed gently twice per hour during the incubation. Thereafter, the EC islets, 
EC-MSC islets, and untreated control islets were cultured for up to 6 days at 
37°C in EC medium or islet medium (CMRL; Invitrogen) until analyzed. The 
medium was changed every second day. Quantification of EC adherence was 
performed on EC islets and EC-MSC islets after 1 and 4 days of culture. 
In vitro islet survival assay and cytokine and insulin content determi-
nation. A total of 100 islets per donor (n ϭ 6) were hand picked: 50 islets 
were coated with 5 ϫ 10 
3 MSCs and 5 ϫ 10 
3 ECs, and 50 islets were untreated. 
All islets were cultured for 6 days in EC medium, with a medium change every 
second day. The number of remaining islets in the respective groups were 
counted after 1, 3, and 6 days of culture, and the islet number was confirmed 
after 6 days by dithizone staining (18). Control and EC-MSC islets were 
collected after 6 days of culture. Total DNA (Picogreen; Invitrogen), interleu-
kin (IL)-8, IL-6 (R&amp;D Systems, Oxford, U.K.), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 
(MCP-1) (Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), tissue factor (TF) (Imubind; American 
Diagnostica, Stamford, CT), and insulin (Mercodia) contents were measured 
on a Gyrolab workstation (Gyros, Uppsala, Sweden), and the values were 
divided with total DNA. Four or more different islet isolations with 20 islets in 
each condition were analyzed. 
Dynamic perifusion. The functionality of the islets coated with EC-MSC and 
of untreated islets from the same isolation was tested at different time points 
after coating (at 24 h and day 3-4). EC medium was used during the first 24 h 
of suspension culture; thereafter, the medium was changed to islet medium 
with supplements (17). Islets were challenged in a dynamic perifusion system, 
beginning with a low glucose concentration (1.67 mmol/l) during the first 36 
min, followed by a high-glucose challenge (20 mmol/l) for 42 min, then 
reexposure to the low glucose concentration during the last 48 min. Fractions 
were collected at 6-min intervals over 126 min and analyzed for insulin content 
using commercial ELISA kits (Mercodia Insulin ELISA; Mercodia, Uppsala, 
Sweden). The area under the curve was calculated to evaluate the insulin 
secretion during high glucose stimulation with subtracted basal insulin 
secretion. Four different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were 
analyzed. 
Fibrin gel in vitro angiogenesis assay. Control, EC, and EC-MSC islets 
were placed between two layers of fibrin gel (2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen and 2 g/ml 
thrombin; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After polymerization, EC medium 
supplemented with VEGF (30 ng/ml; Peprotech) was added. The islet prepa-
rations (n ϭ 6) were cultured for 24 h, 48 h, and 3-4 days and then fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde. Sprouts were counted manually by the same person 
(blinded to the composition of the islet preparation), and 4 -20 islets were 
counted per group in each experiment. The EC sprout length was measured 
using <rs id="software-3" type="software">Leica Qwin</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Leica Microsystems</rs>, Nussloch, Germany) on 
pictures taken on day 4 of EC and EC-MSC islets in fibrin gel. The total EC </p>

<p>sprout length per islet was calculated for each experiment (groups of 2-10 
islets, n ϭ 6). The mean total sprout length per islet for all the experiments 
(n ϭ 6) was then calculated. The frequencies of the various sprout types were 
calculated by analyzing micrographs of EC-MSC islets from the fibrin gel 
experiments (n ϭ 6). 
Immunohistochemical staining. Composite and control islets were fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed in PBS, and incubated in 20% 
sucrose/PBS overnight at 4°C, then embedded in optimal cutting temperature 
medium (Tissue Tech; Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands), frozen, 
cryosectioned, and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. 
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using guinea pig anti-human 
insulin (1:400; Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA) followed by 
Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) or Alexa 
Fluor 488 -conjugated mouse anti-human CD31 (1:100; Becton Dickinson). 
Counterstaining was performed with DAPI (10 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). 
Production of DsRed-expressing lentiviral particles and lentiviral vec-
tor infection of ECs. Stocks of Discosoma species-derived red fluorescent 
(DsRed)-expressing lentiviral vectors (Lv-DsRed) were produced by cotrans-
fection of three plasmids, the viral core packaging construct pCMVdeltaR8.74, 
the VSV-G envelope protein vector pMDG.2, and the transfer vector pRRLsin-
PPThCMV-MCS-wpre containing DsRed cDNA (a gift of W.T. Hendriks), into 
human embryonic kidney 293T cells as previously described (19,20). 
HDMECs at passage 3 were seeded onto 1% gelatin-coated six-well plates 
(1 ϫ 10 
5 cells/well; AH Diagnostics) and cultured for 48 h. Virus at a titer of 
2 ϫ10 
5 TU/ml Lv-DsRed was added to the subconfluent cells in combination 
with 2 g/ml Sequa-Brene (Sigma-Aldrich) in EC medium. The plate was spun 
for 60 min during the Lv-DsRed infection of the ECs, and, thereafter, 
additional fresh medium was added to the cells. The DsRed ECs were then 
used in the long-term islet culture experiments according to the previously 
described protocol for coating of islets. 
Image analysis and quantification. Coating, morphology, and sprout anal-
yses were performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 
510 Meta; Carl Zeiss International, Oberkochen, Germany) and/or fluores-
cence microscopy (Nikon Elipse E600, Nikon TS100; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). 
Confocal z-stack images composed of 10 pictures were merged to produce a 
picture for use in analyzing EC adherence. Micrographs were analyzed using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Leica Qwin</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Leica microsystems</rs>) to determine the surface area and 
total sprout length. The frequency of particular types of sprout composition 
was calculated from pictures using <rs type="software">Adobe Photoshop</rs> software. Quantification 
of islet number was accomplished by the use of a stereomicroscope (Leica 
Microsystems), and pictures were analyzed using <rs type="software">Adobe Photoshop</rs> software. 
Ingrowth of DsRed ECs into the islets was evaluated using confocal micros-
copy z-stack images, visualizing ECs at a defined depth of 30 m into the islets 
after 3 or 6 days of culture, with a majority of samples being analyzed after 6 
days. A defined distance of 30 m from the islet surface was chosen to yield 
good confocal resolution. The presence of ECs was scored as 0 -3, with 0 
indicating the absence of ECs from the islet section and scores of 1-3 
indicating a scarce (1), intermediate (2), or abundant (3) amount of ECs 
present. 
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means Ϯ SEM. Mean values were 
compared using a two-tailed Wilcoxon test for paired data, with significance 
set at P Յ 0.05. </p>

<p>The primary end point hypothesis used for sample-size estimation 
was that combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 would 
increase the median PFS by 2 months (from 3 to 5 months) 
compared with gemcitabine monotherapy with a type I error 
probability of 5% (one-sided) and power of 80%. The required 
number of patients was 50 and a 5% dropout was accounted for in 
the sample-size calculation. The OS from randomisation was 
calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of death 
from any cause or censored at the last follow-up. The PFS was 
calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of either 
disease progression or death or censored at the last follow-up. 
The OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, 
and were compared between treatment arms using the log-rank 
test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the 
hazard ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The ORRs were 
reported as best achieved response rates. Proportions between the 
arms were compared using the w 
2 test or Fisher's test; quantitative 
variables were compared using Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon 
test. All analyses were conducted based on the intention-to-treat 
principle. Two-sided P-values o0.05 were considered to be 
significant. The final analysis was based on follow-up information, 
which was collected until February 2011. <rs id="software-0" type="software">JMP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">8.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. </p>

with heteroskedasticity; endogenous regressors 
with natural experiments, instrumental vari-
ables, and two-stage estimators; panel data; and 
sample selection issues. Each module features 
"real-world" datasets and sample programs 
written in <rs type="software">Stata</rs>, <rs type="software">SAS</rs>, and <rs type="software">Limdep</rs>. Information 
on website "hits" is now available for the period 
corresponding to the 2011 "spring semester" at 
most US schools, from January-May 2011. The 
monthly average over this period was 220 hits/ 
views, with more hits in early and middle months 
of the "term." It appears (as supported by anec-
dotal accounts) that the modules and datasets 
are being used in many econometrics classes 
as general teaching tools, not just to introduce 
research topics in economic education. 
The Committee supports an NSF-funded proj-
ect on "Teaching with Data" in undergraduate 
social science courses, directed by George Alter 
and Bill Frey (both at Michigan). Tisha Emerson 
(Baylor) is the Committee representative for the 
project's advisory board. A national survey of 
faculty across disciplines and Carnegie classifi-
cations of schools was completed and described 
in 2011 reports and found that instructors in eco-
nomics are much more demanding about quan-
titative skills than instructors from other social 
sciences, while faculty at Associate schools 
and non-tenure track faculty are less likely to 
teach quantitative reasoning. A presentation on 
this project was included in the Committee's 
annual poster session at the Chicago meetings 
in January 2012. 
The Committee supported an NSF-funded 
project on "Adapting Effective Outreach and 
Workshop Practices to Improve Community 
College Economics Instruction," directed by 
Mark Maier (Glendale Community College) 
and Cathryn Manduca (Carleton College). 
Participants in this program attended a work-
shop in Palo Alto for two days in May 2011, and 
many then attended the Committee's June 1-3 
conference on teaching economics at Stanford, 
described above.

downloaded using <rs type="software">Medtronic CareLink 
software</rs>. Afternoon snacks were identi-
fied on CGM as glucose excursions be-
ginning between 1330 and 1700 h. A 
glucose excursion was considered re-
solved when glucose levels remained 
steady for Ն15 min. Glucose excursions 
with incomplete CGM data or CSII sus-

and possible snacks not fitting these cri-
teria were excluded from analysis. 
SNI criteria were as follows: 1) no bo-

<p>transformed cells (contrast probe sets) at any of the three 
time points (relative to time 0 h), as we hypothesized that 
contrast gene expression might underpin the different 
biological responses of donor-matched cells to vorinostat 
treatment. In total, 5959 contrast probe sets were identified 
and these were differently regulated by vorinostat in terms of 
either the direction (induction or repression) or the magnitude 
(degree of induction or repression) of the vorinostat response 
in BJ and BJ LTSTERas cells. Of the 5959 contrast probe 
sets, 2945 were equally expressed in untreated normal and 
tumor cells. However, 6226 of the 9240 probe sets with basal 
expression differences did not respond differently to vorino-
stat in the two cell types. These data indicated that the basal 
gene expression levels did not determine the capacity of 
genes to differently respond to vorinostat treatment in BJ and 
BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. GO and pathway analyses were 
performed on the contrast gene list using the <rs type="software">Ingenuity </p>

(FDR ¼ 5 Â 10

(lys, phe, thr and dap) were diluted in Poly-A control dilution buffer (serial dilutions 
of 1 : 20, 1 : 50 and 1 : 25) and 2 ml of the third serial dilution was spiked into each 
RNA sample prior to cDNA synthesis. RNA was reverse transcribed using a one-
cycle cDNA synthesis kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and all annealing, 
amplification and incubation steps were performed in accordance with the

<p>Abstract 
Background: In order to provide a better healthcare education to the society, health care students should have an 
acceptable electronic health (E-Health) literacy. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the level of E-Health literacy of Medicine and Health Sciences 
university students in Mashhad, Iran. 
Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 192 students of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences 
using a validated Persian translate of the E-Health literacy scale (P-EHEALS) questionnaire in 2016. 
Demographic data including age, monthly income, level of education, preference of website for obtaining health 
related information and minutes of Internet use per day were obtained from the subjects. Independent-samples t-
test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for comparison between groups, and Pearson correlation 
coefficient and linear regression were used to assess the correlation between study parameters and EHEALS 
score using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 21</rs>. 
Results: A total of 192 (67.2% female and 32.8% male) subjects with mean age of 24.71±5.30 years participated 
in the study. Mean P-EHEALS score of the subjects was 28.21±6.95. There was a significant difference in P-
EHEALS score between genders (p&lt;0.001), department (p=0.001), education level (p&lt;0.001) and health status 
(p=0.003) as well as monthly income (p=0.03), website preference categories (p=0.02). Male students were 
significantly more likely to gain higher P-EHEALS scores.

<p>2.4. Statistical Analysis 
Data was analyzed using IBM© <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS©</rs> Statistics <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 21</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM© Corp.</rs>., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous 
variables were checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to 
describe the normally distributed variables while median and interquartile range (IQR) were used to describe non-
normally distributed variables. Categorical variables were described using frequency and percentage. Comparison of 
the P-EHEALS scores between genders and departments was performed using independent-samples t-test, while the 
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare p-EHALS scores between monthly income categories. 
The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of minutes of Internet use between groups. The Pearson 
correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation of age with P-EHEALS score, while the Spearman 
correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between minutes of Internet use and P-EHEAS score. </p>

<p>Patient characteristics, serum levels of GHR and OB, 
GHR/OB ratio and GET T 1/2 are expressed as mean ± standard 
deviation and as median and range depending on the normality 
of the distributions of continuous variables as assessed with 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
Comparisons of preprandial GHR and OB as well as 
GHR/OB ratio between patients and controls were performed 
with Student's t-test, whereas paired t-test was used for 
comparisons between pre-and postprandial levels. Finally, 
t-test was also used to compare both pre-and postprandial 
levels between patients with normal and delayed GET. 
Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test. 
Furthermore the adjusted eff ect of diff erent factors [gender, 
age, body mass index (BMI z-score)] on GET, levels of GHR 
and OB, GHR/OB (pre-and postprandial) was explored 
using multiple regression analysis. Statistical analyses were 
performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 17.0</rs> soft ware (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc</rs>, 
Chicago, IL). P values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically 
signifi cant. </p>

<p>Background: Recent studies indicate an increased incidence of pertussis disease in recent years. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the acellular vaccine for children (as a replacement of current whole 
cell vaccine in the Expanded Program on Immunization) and for high-risk adults in Iran through updating cur-
rent best available evidence. 
Methods: We performed a systematic literature review in relevant databases we focused on previously published 
systematic reviews to select those that address our questions. The <rs type="software">AMSTAR</rs> (assessing the methodological quality of 
systematic reviews) tool was used for screening available reviews. Then search in databases was done until Feb 2014 
to update the evidence. We pooled results using meta-analysis methods by <rs type="software">Stata statistical package</rs>. 
Results: Eleven systematic review articles were included in the initial evaluation. In the end, two systematic 
reviews on acellular vaccine booster doses and the acellular vaccine in children were selected as the baseline 
evidence. In the update phase, new clinical trials were screened, and the results were updated. Overall pooled 
estimate of relative efficacy of acellular to whole cell was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.55-0.81) for children immunization 
Pooled estimates for the efficacy of acellular versus placebo were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80). Overall pooled 
estimate of efficacy of booster dose of acellular was 0.87(95% CI, 0.85-0.88) compared to placebo. In addition 
pooled estimate of acellular vaccine efficacy based on response to antigen was 0.78(95% CI, 0.64-0.93) in high-
risk group. 
Conclusion: The results show higher performance and safety of the acellular vaccine in the prevention of pertus-
sis in children versus the whole cell vaccine. Moreover, the efficacy of the acellular vaccine in high-risk adult 
groups is acceptable. This study provides evidence in favor of the introduction of an acellular vaccine to the na-
tional program of immunization. Studies on cost effectiveness and aspects of policy analysis are recommended. </p>

<p>Quality assessment 
The systematic review studies were as-
sessed with <rs type="software">AMSTAR</rs> (A program that as-
sesses the quality of the articles in 11 dif-
ferent areas.), and the clinical trials were 
assessed with CASP (<rs type="software">Critical Appraisal 
Skills Programme (CASP) tool</rs>) (15,16). </p>

<p>Data Synthesis 
The statistical analyses were done via 
<rs id="software-5" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">version 11</rs>. Indicators for assessing 
the clinical trials were risk ratio (RR) or 
odds ratio (OR). For the high-risk group, 
we did not find enough studies to assess 
clinical outcomes through RR or OR, so, 
we assessed the vaccine immunogenicity 
and analysis was performed on the response 
rate to the antigen. For calculating the vac-
cine efficacy, we used RR-1 formula (17). 
Moreover, publication biases of the studies 
were assessed via Funnel-plot with regres-</p>

<p><rs type="software">Javascript</rs> as client-side programming languages. "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" enables 
lecturers to create and manage question sets online and start polls in-
class via a web-browser. Students can participate in the polls with any 
internet-enabled device (smartphones, tablet-PCs or laptops). A paper-
based survey was conducted with undergraduate medical students and 
lecturers at TUM to compare "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" with conventional AR systems 
using clickers. "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" received above-average evaluation results 
by both students and lecturers at TUM and was seen on par or superior 
to conventional AR systems. The survey results indicated that up to 80% 
of students at TUM own an internet-enabled device (smartphone or 
tablet-PC) for participation in web-based AR technologies. 
Summary and Conclusion: "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" is a novel web-based and plat-
form-independent AR system for higher education that was well received 
by students and lecturers. As a non-commercial alternative to conven-
tional AR systems it may foster interactive teaching in undergraduate 
education, in particular with large audiences. </p>

<p>result in improved short-term and long-term knowledge 
outcomes [4]. However, many instructors only reluctantly 
use AR systems in teaching. Frequently cited reasons are 
high acquisition and maintenance costs, logistic efforts 
or technical difficulties to operate AR system with different 
operating systems and presenter software [5]. 
To overcome these limitations we sought to develop a 
novel web-based AR system that is specifically adapted 
to the didactic needs and economic requirements of 
higher education. Here we present "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>", a novel 
smartphone-and web-based AR system that is free-to-
use, platform independent and does not require hardware 
clicker or additional software. Based on user evaluation 
data, we analyzed the strengths and limitations of "On-
lineTED" in comparison with a conventional AR system 
that is used at TUM and discuss the potential of web-
based AR systems for undergraduate medical education. </p>

<p>"OnlineTED" was developed and programmed by students 
and lecturers at TUM. <rs type="software">Hypertext Preprocessor</rs> (PHP) as 
server-side programming language was used to build a 
web-based AR system that is compatible with different 
operating systems. The user interface was linked to a <rs type="software">My 
Structured Query Language</rs> (MySQL) database for storage 
and management of user accounts and data. <rs type="software">JavaScript</rs> 
was used as client-side programming language for anim-
ated features, e.g. a poll countdown function. Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) was implemented to 
ensure secure internet communication for the user. </p>

<p>The AR system "<rs id="software-25" type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" can be accessed via the open-
access website <rs corresp="#software-25" type="url">http://www.OnlineTED.com</rs> (German 
version: http://www.OnlineTED.de). After log-on, the main 
page conveys information for the auditorium to participate 
in a poll (e.g. website URL for login, session token, quick 
response (QR) code). For the lecturer, the main page is 
the starting point to create, manage or commence polls. 
Flags link to the sub-pages "poll viewer" to start of a 
polling session, "quick poll" for spontaneous polls and 
"poll editor" to create or manage question sets (see Figure 
1). In the latter, new poll sets and questions in multiple-
choice format can be created and saved via an online 
form (see Figure 2). In addition, image (gif, jpg or png), 
movie (mov, avi or mpeg) or sound files (mp3, aac or wav) 
can be uploaded and saved with each question. Other 
media sources of the internet (e.g. http:// 
www.youtube.com/) can be directly embedded. In addition 
to prepared and saved questions sets, the lecturer can 
conduct spontaneous polls by choosing different rating 
scales (yes / no / undecided; very low -very high; excel-
lent -insufficient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) from 
the "quick poll" options. 
Students can participate in the poll after log-on to the 
website with any internet-enabled device (smartphone, 
tablet-PC, laptop). A poll is joined by entering a four-digit 
access code (session token) that is automatically gener-
ated and displayed for each session. Alternatively, stu-
dents can scan a QR code with their mobile device. Upon 
session log-on, answer options are automatically dis-
played on the student devices (see Figure 3A ). After vot-
ing, the results are dynamically displayed in the present-
ation by the lecturer as growing histograms depicting the 
number and percentage of votes for each answer (see 
Figure 3B ). 
Each poll question requires a bidirectional data transfer 
of approximately 0.03 Mbit. Based on the average con-
nections speed of wireless Local Area Network (LAN) (54 
MBits/s) or cellular mobile networks such as Universal 
Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) (7.2 Mbit/s) 
[6], "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" enables polls with large audiences in a 
typical lecture hall setting. </p>

<p>The AR system was programmed in <rs type="software">PHP</rs> as a server-sided 
programming language to be compatible with all operating 
systems without the requirement to install additional 
software. </p>

<p>To evaluate the use of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" in higher education, 
the tool was tested with undergraduate medical students 
and instructors in lectures (average number of parti-
cipants: 200±50) and seminars (average number of 
participants: 22±3) of pharmacology at TUM in the winter 
term of 2012/13. A conventional AR system using hard-
ware clickers (Interwrite Cricket , Scotsdale, USA) that is 
routinely used for teaching at TUM served as a comparis-
on. 
Information on usability and user perception of the two 
different AR systems was solicited through a paper survey 
at the end of the term. A 1-to-6 rating scale was used to 
assess the overall rating of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>". The answer op-
tions were 1 "excellent", 2 "very good", 3 "good", 4 "fair", 
5 "poor" and 6 "inadequat". For the comparison of "Online-
TED" and the conventional AR systems, survey parti-
cipants were asked to select the option "superior", "equal" 
or "inferior" for each of the categories, respectively. 
Study participation was voluntary and both informed 
consent by the participants and approval by the ethics 
committee of TUM were obtained. Website statistics were 
tracked by <rs type="software">Google Analytics</rs> (Google, Mountain View, CA). </p>

<p>Comparison "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" vs. conventional AR 
system </p>

<p>A conventional AR system using hardware clickers (Inter-
write Cricket , Scotsdale, USA) that is routinely used for 
teaching at TUM served as a comparison. Interwrite 
Cricket consists of 2.4 Ghz band radio receiver and radio 
transmitters (clicker). The system can manage up to 2047 
clickers per receiver. The keypad of the clicker consists 
of six numeric and additional true and false buttons. The 
clickers are powered by two AAA batteries each that last 
approximately 20 weeks based on typical usage. The 
operative range of the clickers is up to 150 feet (45.7 m) 
from the receivers (in free space). <rs id="software-15" type="software">Interwrite Cricket</rs> soft-
ware runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and supports the 
generation of multiple-choice and true/false questions 
with a authoring software that requires installation on 
the computer of the presenter (<rs corresp="#software-15" type="url">http://www.banxia.com/prs/hardware/cricket</rs>). 
In contrast, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" is a web-based AR system that 
utilizes internet-enabled end devices of the audience as 
handsets. "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" does not require the installation 
of software, is fully web-based and thus can be used on 
any operating system. Each poll question requires a bi-
directional data transfer of approximately 0.03 Mbit, 
which enables the participation of large audiences even </p>

participation such as website URL for login, session token or quick response code. Flags link to the sub-pages "poll viewer" to 
start a polling session, "quick poll" for spontaneous polls and "poll editor" to create or manage question sets. </p>

<p>with low data bandwidth. The operative range of "Online-
TED" is not spatially limited and thus can be used for 
distance teaching, e.g. webinars. Sets of multiple-choice 
questions can be created and manage in "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>", 
and spontaneous polls with different rating scales (yes / 
no / undecided; very low -very high; excellent -insuffi-
cient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) conducted as 
"quick polls" options. </p>

<p>To evaluate "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" and compare its user acceptance 
with conventional AR systems, a paper-based survey was 
conducted with students and lecturers at TUM. 361 of 
709 (51%) students participated in the survey. Of these, 
203 students were in their first clinical year (third year of 
study) at TUM and enrolled in the course "basic pharma-
cology" consisting of lectures and seminars. 158 students 
were in the third clinical year (sixth year of study) at TUM 
and enrolled in the course "clinical pharmacology" that </p>

<p>The <rs corresp="#software-36" type="version-number">beta-version</rs> of "<rs id="software-36" type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" was made available on 
<rs corresp="#software-36" type="version-date">November1st,2012</rs> at <rs corresp="#software-36" type="url">http://www.OnlineTED.com</rs> (Ger-
man version: http://www.OnlineTED.de). As of February 
28th, 2013, the website has been accessed by 2,997 
visitors with 37,696 page hits (approximately 750 visitors 
and 9,424 page hits per month). 
The overall rating of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" by lecturers was "very 
good" (5 out of 10) or "excellent" (4 out of 10). The didact-
ic benefit of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" for teaching was considered 
"excellent" by 6 out of 10 and "very good" by 3 out of 10 
lecturers. Free text comments by the lecturers indicated 
that "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" provided a "helpful basis for in-class 
discussions between students and lecturer". In addition, 
"playful discussion of topics and clinical problems", e.g. 
by presenting clinical cases and questions on pharmaco-
therapy, drug choice and clinical management were 
considered a key didactic benefit of AR systems. A specific 
advantage of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" was seen in the possibility to 
"spontaneously assess the learning and knowledge state" 
of the students by using the instant poll option. 
When asked to compare "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" with conventional 
AR systems using hardware clickers, the lecturers rated 
"OnlineTED" superior in seven out of nine categories (see 
Figure 4A ). The areas with the highest advantage for 
lecturers were seen in time required to use the TED sys-</p>

<p>tem for the first time, well as its flexibility (10 out of 10 
and 9 out of 10, respectively). 
Approximately 80% (289 of 361) of the undergraduate 
medical students in the studied cohort at TUM indicated 
to own a mobile internet-enabled device (smartphone, 
tablet-PC or iPad). Of these, the majority (92%, n=265) 
could access the polling session without difficulty using 
either wireless LAN or cellular data network during lec-
tures or seminars. The vast majority of students (94%, 
n= 274) gave an overall rating for "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" of "excel-
lent" or "very good". "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" was seen on par or su-
perior in all categories when compared to conventional 
AR systems using hardware clickers (see Figure 4B ). </p>

<p>In this article we present "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>", a novel web-based 
audience response system that is free-to-use, platform-
independent and does not require hardware clickers. Our 
aim was to develop an AR system for higher education 
that is on par with commercial systems with respect to 
functionality and usability. Surprisingly, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" was 
evaluated superior in a number of categories by both 
students and lecturers (see Figure 4). In particular, its 
usability and flexibility with regard to handling, question 
management and in-class performance were seen as key 
advantages of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" in comparison to conventional 
AR systems. Finally, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" is a non-commerical AR 
system that is freely available to educators and students 
worldwide. 
A potential limitation of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" is its dependency on 
internet availability that may be limited or restricted at 
some university campuses due to poor WLAN coverage </p>

results by undergraduate medical students at TUM. The response rate was 8 of 10 and 361 of 709 (51%), respectively. The 
stacked bars depict the relationship of individual items to the whole in percent. </p>

<p>or cellular network reception. Another important issue is 
the safety of data on the internet. To address these con-
cerns, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" has implemented HTTPS, a commu-
nications protocol for secure communication over a 
computer network that is used for sensitive data transfer 
e.g. electronic banking. HTTPS provides bi-directional 
encryption of data transfer between a client and server 
and authentication of the web site and associated web 
server [7]. As an additional safety measure, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" 
does not permit users to identify the IP address of devices 
used in a poll, thus assuring the anonymity of poll parti-
cipants. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to in-
vestigate the concerns and attitudes of students and 
lecturers to web-based technology and its impact for 
higher education. 
Extensive research on AR systems in higher education 
has indicated their effectiveness on different learning 
outcomes, such as knowledge gain, student self-confid-
ence and positive learner reactions (reviewed by [5], [8], 
[9]). The most commonly cited benefit of AR systems are 
the increased student engagement through active parti-
cipation. However, while AR systems provide a convenient 
way to improve student interactivity, it is in the end ped-
agogy and didactic implementation that matters. In a re-
cent study by Smith et al. [10], students were encouraged 
to discuss TED clicker questions with their classmates 
prior to voting. The authors demonstrated that peer dis-</p>

<p>cussions are effective means of active learning that res-
ulted in significantly improved conceptual understanding 
when used with AR systems. In this regard, the frequently 
cited limitation of AR systems that not all students may 
be able to participate in a poll due to limited numbers of 
clickers or internet-enabled devices may offer the oppor-
tunity for collaborative voting and peer discussions in 
class. Another pedagogical aspect of AR systems, which 
is often overlooked, is its use in formative assessment 
and feedback. A recent report by Alexander et al. showed 
that AR systems can be successfully used to monitor the 
progress of students in the curriculum and allow students 
to compare their learning progress with other classmates 
[11] . 
The omnipresence of the internet and availability of 
computer-based technologies open up new opportunities 
to actively engage students in teaching. Our survey re-
vealed that up to 80% of undergraduate medical students 
at TUM posses an internet-enabled device (smartphone, 
tablet or iPad). This results is in accordance with recent 
studies that 60 to 80% of UK medical students own a 
smartphone [12], [13]. Web-based AR systems such as 
"<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" may thus provide a feasible alternative to 
conventional, hardware-based AR technology in teaching 
and become a suitable tool to foster interactive learning 
and student engagement in undergraduate medical 
education, in particular with large audiences. </p>

<p>All image analysis was performed in <rs id="software-1" type="software">Matlab</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">MathWorks</rs>, Cambridge, 
United Kingdom) using custom-written software as described previ-
ously (Taylor et al., 2011), with the following modifications. Scripts 
were written in <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> to segment spots using the wavelet-based 
multiscale products as described previously (Olivo-Marin, 2002). 
The coordinates of spots were extracted in <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> and track histo-
ries generated using a <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> version of the IDL nearest-neighbor 
algorithm (www.physics.emory.edu/∼weeks/idl/). To detect the very 
faint mApp-β2AR (+) scission events, the fluorescence of candidate 
spots was quantified using a circle-minus-annulus measurement in 
which segmented spots were excluded from the annulus. This elimi-
nated a major source of noise in the fluorescence measurement and 
allowed a more accurate estimate of fluorescence. </p>

<p>Data were collected from repeated experiments and 
are presented as mean±SEM. Independent T-test was 
used to compare the significant difference of gene 
expression in each group. A P value less than 0.05 
denoted significant differences. All analyses were 
performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences (SPSS</rs>) ver.<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">16</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs>, New York, NY, 
USA). </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using one-way ANOVA with 
Bonferroni post-test via the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> for Windows software package (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 17</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Unpaired two-tailed Student's t test 
was used to compare means between different groups. A value of 
p b 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. Results are 
expressed as mean ± SD. All figures were rendered using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5</rs> 
software package (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">GraphPad Software</rs>, CA, USA). </p>

<p>Data analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences</rs> (SPSS) <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9</rs>. Dif-
ferences between controls and alcoholics were test-
ed using the χ 2 test and considered significant if 
the type 1 error was less than 5% using <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>. The 
Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was calculated using 
the <rs type="software">SAS</rs> computer program for Windows. Odds 
ratios and confidence intervals at 95% were also 
calculated. Haplotype frequencies and linkage dis-
equilibrium were calculated using R with <rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Biocon-ductor</rs> packages <rs id="software-4" type="software">haplo.stats</rs> and <rs type="software">genetics</rs>. </p>

<p>The summarized receiver operating characteristic (SROC) 
curve was constructed. In diagnostic test, heterogeneity was 
commonly caused by threshold effect. When threshold effect 
existed, there was a negative correlation between sensitivity and 
specificity. Heterogeneity caused by the threshold effect was 
evaluated by Spearman's correlation coefficient. If there were 
more than one threshold in an article, the threshold with the 
largest Youden index was chosen. The percentage of the total 
variation across studies was described by the I 
2 statistic, which 
indicated the existence of significant heterogeneity when the 
value exceeded 50%. The value of I 
2 ranges from 0 to 100%, 
with 0 implying no observed heterogeneity, and larger values 
indicating increasing heterogeneity. 
[18] The random effects 
model was chosen due to the expected clinical and statistical 
heterogeneity among the studies. 
[17] For all effect estimates, 
P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses 
were conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Meta-Disc</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version14.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Unit of Clinical Biostatistics team</rs>, Madrid, Spain). </p>

<p>The force of this restriction turns on the definitions of what constitute "other" 
and "integrated" products. Not long after Microsoft and the Department of Justice 
signed the consent decree, Microsoft began requiring computer manufacturers to 
license and install <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft</rs>'s <rs id="software-0" type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> browser as a condition for being 
able to obtain a license for the Windows 95 operating system. Microsoft argued that 
the <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> browser was part of the operating system, not a separate 
product. The Department of Justice disagreed and sought an injunction against 
Microsoft. 
On December 11, 1997, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered Microsoft to 
offer its <rs id="software-2" type="software">Windows</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">95</rs> operating system and Internet Explorer as separate products. 
Microsoft appealed his ruling. The appeals court reversed Judge Jackson's order, </p>

<p>ruling that <rs id="software-3" type="software">Windows</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">95</rs> and <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> provided computer users with 
functionality that did not exist with separate programs and thus passed the "inte-
grated product" provision of the consent decree (U.S. v. Microsoft, U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, No. 97-5343, June 23, 1998, at footnote 
14). Whatever one thinks of the merits of the two sides' positions following the 1995 
consent decree, it is clear that the conduct remedy did not work as the Department 
of Justice had intended. </p>

<p>On May 18, 1998, the government brought an antitrust case against Microsoft 
alleging that the company had monopolized the markets for personal computer 
operating systems and browsers (U.S. v. Microsoft, 1998). The government's case 
against Microsoft rested on allegations that Microsoft compelled computer manu-
facturers to license and install <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>, entered into contracts that tended 
to exclude rivals, and engaged in various forms of predatory conduct. 
Microsoft and the government both considered Internet browsers combined 
with the Java language and server-based applications to be particularly potent 
sources of potential competition for Windows. In theory, the Java programming 
language offered a standard to which creators of applications, such as spreadsheet 
and word processing programs, could write without regard for the underlying 
operating system. Java did this by providing a "middleware" layer of software 
between applications programs and the underlying operating system. <rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Netscape</rs> was 
a threat to Microsoft because its <rs id="software-6" type="software">Navigator</rs> browser was a distribution vehicle for 
Java that could further its acceptance as a language for application programs that 
was independent of the underlying operating system. In addition, there was a 
possibility that <rs corresp="#software-7" type="creator">Netscape</rs> <rs id="software-7" type="software">Navigator</rs> itself could grow into a substitute for <rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> 
<rs id="software-8" type="software">Windows</rs> or facilitate server-based applications that made minimal use of the 
desktop operating system. These are the outcomes the government sought to 
preserve and Bill Gates (1995) feared when he wrote that Netscape threatened to 
"commoditize the underlying operating system." 
The government alleged that Microsoft sought to eliminate the competitive 
threat posed by Java and Netscape in two ways. The first was to eliminate Netscape's 
browser as a commercially viable product through an offer of market division 
and-after that offer was rejected-a combination of predatory and exclusionary 
actions. The second was to undermine Java as an operating-system-independent 
platform by promoting a Windows-specific version of Java. </p>

<p>courts commonly assess market power by first defining the relevant market(s) 
affected by a firm's conduct. A relevant market is a set of products that consumers 
consider to be reasonably close substitutes for each other (see, for example, U.S. 
Department of Justice, 1992, sec. 1.11). Once a relevant market has been defined, 
the assessment of market power moves to the calculation of market share, exami-
nation of competitive interactions, determination of the conditions of entry, and 
analysis of other pertinent structural features of the market. Katz and Shapiro 
(1999) discuss the assessment of market power in software markets. 
The government alleged that Microsoft was a monopolist in the relevant 
market comprising Intel-compatible personal computer operating systems. The 
government reasoned that buyers of Intel-compatible personal computers have no 
substitutes for operating systems designed to work on those systems. Microsoft's 
share of shipments of Intel-based personal computer operating systems has been 
90 percent or more in recent years. 
The government also argued that another operating system would be hard-
pressed to displace Windows directly. IBM was reported to have spent more than 
$1 billion to develop, test, and market its <rs type="software">OS/2</rs> operating system as an alternative 
to Windows (Gilbert, 1998). The new operating system was a commercial failure, in 
part because IBM could not overcome the chicken-and-egg problem that arises 
from "network effects," whereby the demand for a product increases with the 
number of other users of the product or with the number of complementary goods 
and services for that product. Specifically, because of switching costs and consum-
ers' desires for a variety of applications programs, an operating system cannot gain 
widespread acceptance until it has a large set of available applications. But because 
of economies of scale and sunk costs in software development, applications pro-
grammers do not want to write to an operating system unless there is a large base 
of users. The government labeled this problem the "applications barrier to entry." 
Professor Richard Schmalensee, Microsoft's chief economics expert at trial, 
countered that competition in the personal computer software market was among 
"platforms," not operating systems. 2 A platform is a set of software interfaces to 
which programmers can write applications such as spreadsheets or schedulers. 
Platforms include operating systems such as the <rs type="software">Mac OS</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-24" type="creator">Sun</rs> <rs id="software-24" type="software">Solaris</rs>, and <rs type="software">Linux</rs>, 
and various forms of middleware including web server/browser software, <rs type="software">Lotus 
Notes</rs>, and <rs corresp="#software-27" type="creator">Sun</rs>'s <rs id="software-27" type="software">Java</rs>, that are intermediate between operating systems and desk-
top applications. Schmalensee argued that Microsoft faced significant competition 
from existing and future software platforms, any one of which could emerge as the 
new standard for desktop computing. 
Schmalensee also asserted that in high-technology markets traditional mea-
sures of market share provide misleading assessments of the degree of competition. 
Markets with significant network effects, technological progress, and production 
economies of scale can exhibit catastrophic entry, whereby one product dominates 
the market until another product is sufficiently superior that it becomes the new </p>

<p>able under antitrust policy (for example, U.S. Department of Justice, 1995, 
sec. 2.2). Indeed, it would not make economic sense to punish a firm that possesses 
market power solely as a consequence of its having developed a superior product, 
because doing so would erode the incentives for innovation. We return to the issue 
of whether Microsoft abused its market power below. 
In addition to creating substantial market power for Microsoft, the applica-
tions barrier to entry was central to the government's theory of why Microsoft took 
the actions it did with respect to browsers and <rs type="software">Java</rs>. According to the government, 
Microsoft had incentives to work hard to protect that barrier by ensuring that other 
operating systems could not share a common set of applications through middle-
ware. The reason middleware, such as <rs type="software">Java</rs> or a web browser, is a threat to Microsoft 
in a way that full operating systems are not is the following. If a user were to adopt 
an operating system other than Windows, the user would have to forego the large base 
of Windows applications. Thus, an operating systems entrant either has to offer 
consumers much lower value or has to incur large sunk costs to develop (or subsidize) 
a wide range of applications programs before there is a large user base to purchase 
them. Middleware written on top of <rs type="software">Windows</rs> would not suffer from this problem. 
Users could adopt the middleware and still make use of the large number of programs 
that run on Windows. Hence, middleware that offered useful new features to a wide 
range of users would have the potential to become widely adopted, which would then 
make it attractive for applications programmers to write to it. As this happened, new 
applications would not be associated with a particular operating system, which would 
reduce the applications barrier to entry for operating systems. 
Evans and Schmalensee (2000a, pp. 62-63) argued that the government's claim 
that there were high barriers to entry but that middleware could overcome them was 
internally inconsistent. We do not see any inconsistency in the position that middle-
ware was a significant crack in the armor of what would otherwise be a strong 
applications barrier to entry and that Microsoft attempted to patch that crack. 
Hall and Hall (1999, p. 25) argued that if the threat of software piracy or other 
factors unrelated to the extent of competition drove Microsoft's operating system 
pricing decisions-as Fisher and Rubinfeld assert-then Microsoft's challenged 
conduct might have no influence on the equilibrium price. Consequently, Mi-
crosoft would not have anticompetitive incentives. This argument, however, ignores 
the possibility that, absent the challenged conduct, the strength of competition 
could have grown to limit Microsoft's market power. The existence of significant 
market power, even if in the short run constrained by factors other than competi-
tion, can provide stimulus for Microsoft to engage in conduct intended to protect 
that market power in the long run. </p>

<p>Exclusionary Behavior 
Exclusionary behavior entails denying rivals access to some resource or set of 
consumers in order to raise the rivals' costs and weaken their ability to compete (for 
example, Salop and Scheffman, 1987). The government charged that Microsoft 
used several types of contractual arrangements that tended to exclude competitors 
(U.S. v. Microsoft, 1998, para. 75-102). One set of arrangements was with online and 
Internet service providers, such as America Online and AT&amp;T Worldnet, in which 
Microsoft agreed to include a feature in its operating system that made it easy for 
a user to establish an account with a service provider, but only if the service provider 
agreed to deny most or all of its subscribers a choice of Internet browser. 4 A second 
set of agreements was made with personal computer manufacturers, under which 
the manufacturers could neither remove the <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> icon nor feature a 
rival browser more prominently than <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>. Finally, in a third set of 
agreements, Microsoft offered Internet content providers preferential, no-cost 
placement on the <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> "channel bar" in return for their agreement to 
promote <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> as their browser of choice, not to accept compensation 
for featuring their content on Netscape's browser, or to customize their content so 
that it was more attractive when accessed using <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> (U.S. v. Microsoft, 
2000b). 
The traditional "Chicago" view of exclusionary contracts and exclusive dealing 
arrangements is that they must promote efficiency because the buyers in these 
transactions would not agree to contracts that made themselves worse off (Bork, 
1978, p. 309). There is, however, a fundamental flaw in this argument: a buyer may 
agree to an exclusive contract without taking into account harm to third parties. A 
buyer who accounts for only a small fraction of industry purchases has little reason 
to believe that its individual decisions affect the overall degree of competition in a 
market. But if a large number of buyers accept inducements to deal exclusively with 
a single supplier, the overall effect can be to reduce competition to the detriment 
of consumers (Rasmussen, Ramseyer and Wiley, 1991). This analysis applies with 
even greater force when a seller with market power can strategically price discrim-
inate and bargain sequentially with buyers (Segal and Whinston, 2000). A related 
argument holds even with a single buyer if the bargaining takes place before other 
competitors have arrived. By signing a long-term exclusive dealing agreement with 
penalty clauses, the buyer and incumbent seller can force an efficient entrant to 
compensate the buyer for breaking the agreement. In this way, the buyer and 
incumbent seller can appropriate some of the benefits from entry in the form of 
higher profits for themselves (Aghion and Bolton, 1987). 
In many cases, exclusionary practices that raise rivals' costs will lower economic </p>

<p>welfare. However, there are circumstances under which such practices can increase 
efficiency and consumer welfare. For example, raising an inefficient supplier's costs 
can increase total surplus by shifting share to more efficient producers (Katz and 
Shapiro, 1985). And, as discussed below, elimination of a rival may promote 
innovation in some circumstances. Moreover, exclusive dealing that raises distribu-
tion costs for other manufacturers may also support efficient relationship-specific 
investments by the parties entering into the exclusive contract. The net welfare 
effects can be positive or negative (Segal and Whinston, 1998; Gilbert, 2000). Given 
these mixed theoretical predictions about the welfare effects of exclusive dealing, 
antitrust analysis must focus on the institutional details of the specific practices at 
issue in a given case to determine their effects. 
Microsoft defended its contracts on the grounds that they were in force when 
Internet Explorer accounted for only a small share of browser usage and that the 
contracts enabled Microsoft to build share rapidly to become a more formidable 
competitor to Netscape. 5 By describing Microsoft as if it consisted only of a 
fledgling browser striving to compete against established Netscape, this defense 
sidesteps the fact that Microsoft possessed considerable market power in personal 
computer operating systems. The question is whether Microsoft used this market 
power, in combination with exclusionary practices, to hobble a potential compet-
itor to the detriment of consumers. 
Moreover, whatever the theoretical arguments about exclusive contracts in 
general, in this specific case there is little reason to believe that most of these 
contracts promoted efficiency. Microsoft presented no evidence, and we are un-
aware of any evidence, that contracts with online and Internet service providers 
promoted relationship-specific investments. 6 Instead, the main consequence was to 
disadvantage Netscape and other browser competitors. Microsoft asserted that its 
requirements that personal computer manufacturers not remove the <rs type="software">Internet 
Explorer</rs> icon and not feature a rival browser more prominently than <rs type="software">Internet 
Explorer</rs> were justified as promoting a standard <rs type="software">Windows</rs> "look and feel." However, 
the government responded that Microsoft's actions belied this claim, because 
Microsoft permitted personal computer manufacturers to modify the Windows 
desktop when doing so did not promote a competing browser (U.S. v. Microsoft, 
1999, Section V.C). 
In contrast, Microsoft's contracts with Internet content providers had plausible 
efficiency benefits. Microsoft offered favorable placement on the <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> 
channel bar to Internet content providers who designed their content to favor 
<rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>. This arrangement might have generated incentives for these </p>

<p>monopolist can charge $90 (ϭ $100 -$10) for its product A. Now, suppose that 
the monopolist forces consumers to purchase a bundle consisting of A and B. 
Consumers still would pay at most $100 for the bundle, the marginal cost of 
product B would still be $10, and the monopolist would earn $90 from selling 
A. In other words, "extending" its monopoly from A to both A and B would not 
increase the firm's profits. 
There are two reasons why the "one monopoly rent" argument does not apply 
to Microsoft's situation. First, as we discuss below, <rs corresp="#software-42" type="creator">Netscape</rs> <rs id="software-42" type="software">Navigator</rs> initially was 
priced significantly above marginal cost and, consequently, Microsoft had incen-
tives to influence competition in the browser market. Second, the "one monopoly 
rent" argument does not address the fact that predation against complementary 
product B may affect the threat of entry faced by product A. Aron and Wildman 
(1999), Carlton and Waldman (2000), and Whinston (1990) offer models of 
bundling to deter entry. 
The government alleged that Microsoft tried to keep <rs corresp="#software-43" type="creator">Netscape</rs> <rs id="software-43" type="software">Navigator</rs> from 
becoming well established as a browser so that it could not evolve into an operating 
system competitor. The government also alleged that Microsoft wanted to block 
<rs type="software">Navigator</rs> as a distribution vehicle for <rs type="software">Java</rs>, as well as undermine <rs type="software">Java</rs> directly, 
because the widespread deployment of <rs type="software">Java</rs> as a programming language that was 
independent of the underlying operating system threatened to reduce the appli-
cations barrier to entry in operating systems. The government attacked several 
Microsoft practices as predatory. 
Pricing Internet Explorer Below Cost. <rs corresp="#software-48" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> gave <rs id="software-48" type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> away for 
free and paid Apple to use its browser. The government argued that Microsoft's 
actions were predatory because they could be profitable only after taking into 
account benefits to Microsoft from the elimination of competition (Fisher and 
Rubinfeld, 2000, p. 20). Microsoft responded that the profitability of its actions did 
not depend on excluding competition from Netscape. Microsoft claimed that wide 
distribution of Internet Explorer at a zero price made business sense because it 
made personal computers more attractive and thus increased the sales of its 
Windows operating system and other software. Microsoft also said that giving away 
its browser product for free was a valid business model, one followed by many 
software companies, because it would generate future revenues. For example, a free 
browser could help Microsoft establish an Internet portal on which it could sell 
advertising. 
On the surface, Microsoft's position fits the model of Farrell and Katz (2000). 
In that model, product A is monopolized by firm M and the market for comple-
mentary product B is imperfectly competitive. By integrating into the supply of 
product B, firm M can engage in a "squeeze," where it sets the quality-adjusted price 
of its variant of product B lower than would a stand-alone supplier. The squeeze can 
force independent suppliers to charge lower quality-adjusted prices for their variants of 
product B and thus allow firm M to earn greater profits from the sale of comple-
mentary product A. In this model, firm M neither extends its monopoly nor acts in 
a predatory fashion, although independent suppliers could be expected to accuse </p>

<p>it of doing so. Instead, firm M lets the most efficient supplier of component B make 
sales, and firm M takes its profits by charging higher prices for component A. 7 
If Microsoft was concerned with increasing the value of its personal computer 
platform, however, it should have supported any well-made browser product, 
without regard to whether the browser was supplied by Microsoft or by a rival. Trial 
evidence submitted by the government suggested that Microsoft did not want to 
support a rival browser, no matter how good the product might be, and was mainly 
concerned with reducing <rs corresp="#software-49" type="creator">Netscape</rs>'s <rs id="software-49" type="software">Navigator</rs> sales. The government hauled out 
a stack of Microsoft e-mails to argue that Microsoft intended to quash Netscape. 
The government also showed that Microsoft had carried out studies of the impact 
on Netscape's revenues of giving <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> away for free, 8 and a govern-
ment witness testified that Paul Maritz (a senior Microsoft executive) informed him 
that Microsoft's Internet strategy was "to cut off Netscape's air supply, . . . by giving 
away free browsers, Microsoft was going to keep Netscape from getting off the 
ground." 9 
The government also noted that, if Microsoft's strategy of giving away Internet 
Explorer for free was based on promoting sales of its software products, that 
rationale could not explain why Microsoft paid Apple to take its browser. To the 
extent that Microsoft was motivated by sales of software such as <rs type="software">Office</rs> for the 
Macintosh, these concerns would be best served by encouraging Apple to use the 
best browser. The government also did not accept Microsoft's claims that its 
browser distribution strategy was profitable because it promoted the sale of web 
services, such as a portal site. 
Tying and Bundling. To the government, the "integration" of <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> 
with <rs id="software-53" type="software">Windows</rs> <rs corresp="#software-53" type="version-number">95</rs> and later versions of the operating system was little different from 
the contractual bundling of separate products. The government alleged that Mi-
crosoft bundled the operating system and browser as a way to protect its existing 
operating system monopoly by blocking <rs corresp="#software-54" type="creator">Netscape</rs> <rs id="software-54" type="software">Navigator</rs> from growing into a 
platform competitor. The government's main concern was not that Microsoft 
offered an integrated product that combined <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> and <rs type="software">Windows</rs>, but 
rather that Microsoft refused to offer customers the option of taking Windows 
without the browser (Fisher and Rubinfeld, 2000, p. 23). Under the government's 
theory, the bundling was predatory rather than exclusionary. Consumers with 
<rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> already loaded on their personal computers still could install and 
make use of <rs type="software">Navigator</rs>. However, the incremental cost to such customers of using 
<rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> was zero. 
Microsoft responded to the government's bundling charge by contending that </p>

<p>the browser was an integral component of the operating system and that bundling 
<rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> with the operating system was a product improvement no differ-
ent from including a file management program with the operating system. More-
over, Microsoft argued, even if the operating system and browser were distinct 
products, there are plausible efficiency advantages from bundling in the form of 
lower distribution and transactions costs. Microsoft also noted that other operating 
system vendors, such as BeOS, Linux, and Sun, bundled browsers with their 
operating systems. 
Polluting the Java Language. Microsoft developed a version of <rs type="software">Java</rs> that was 
optimized for <rs type="software">Windows</rs> and encouraged programmers to write applications for this 
version. The government alleged that Microsoft tried to "pollute" <rs type="software">Java</rs> so that it 
would not become a standardized language that would run equally well on all 
operating systems. Microsoft's response was that it was merely optimizing <rs type="software">Java</rs> to 
exploit the advanced features of <rs type="software">Windows</rs>, to the benefit of consumers. 10 
According to the government, Microsoft's <rs type="software">Java</rs> strategy was predatory because 
Microsoft was incurring unnecessary costs in the short run to undermine the 
middleware threat posed by a widely deployed programming language that was 
independent of the underlying operating system. Judge Jackson agreed with the 
government in finding that Microsoft acted in ways that did not support its 
efficiency arguments, but were instead intended to undermine the portability of 
<rs type="software">Java</rs>. Judge Jackson concluded that: Microsoft designed its <rs type="software">Java</rs> developer tools to 
encourage developers to write applications using certain abbreviations that could 
only be executed properly by Microsoft's version of the <rs type="software">Java</rs> environment for 
<rs type="software">Windows</rs>; Microsoft refused to incorporate as standard components certain Java 
developments that would enhance portability in the version of <rs type="software">Java</rs> that it shipped 
with <rs id="software-72" type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> <rs corresp="#software-72" type="version-number">4.0</rs>; and Gates pressured Intel not to share its work on a 
high-performance Java virtual machine with Sun or Netscape or to allow Netscape 
to include the Intel product with <rs type="software">Navigator</rs>. In addition, Judge Jackson found that 
Microsoft pressured software vendors, such as the developer of the <rs type="software">RealNetworks</rs> 
multimedia player, to rely on <rs type="software">Windows</rs>-specific <rs type="software">Java</rs> technology rather than more 
portable <rs type="software">Java</rs> implementations in their products (U.S. v. Microsoft, 2000b, Section 
VI.) Lemley and McGowan (1998) also point out Microsoft's opposition to certify-
ing Java as an international standard. </p>

<p>The trial record offers ample evidence that Microsoft intended to eliminate 
the middleware threat to <rs type="software">Windows</rs> posed by the combination of <rs corresp="#software-79" type="creator">Netscape</rs> <rs id="software-79" type="software">Navigator</rs> 
and <rs type="software">Java</rs>. Has Microsoft succeeded in annihilating browser competition? Probably </p>

<p>not. During the Microsoft trial, America Online purchased Netscape for approxi-
mately $4 billion in stock, so that Netscape is now a subsidiary of, and has the 
backing of, the world's largest online service provider. 
Yet by tipping the market in favor of <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>, Microsoft's conduct 
undermined the ability of <rs corresp="#software-82" type="creator">Netscape</rs> <rs id="software-82" type="software">Navigator</rs> to attract software developers to write 
applications that will run in the Netscape/Java environment. According to Ad-
Knowledge, Inc., <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>'s share of monthly browser usage increased 
from 20 percent in January 1997 to more than 50 percent by August 1998, and 
other data suggest it has increased since 1998. 11 Judge Jackson concluded that 
Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct contributed to Netscape's decision not to do 
the engineering work necessary to continue bundling up-to-date "<rs type="software">Java</rs> Virtual 
Machines"-the programs that interpret <rs type="software">Java</rs> for a particular operating system-
that would be compliant with Sun's standards in future versions of Navigator (U.S. 
v. Microsoft, 2000b, at para. 397). </p>

<p>The courts have long recognized that antitrust policy is concerned with harm 
to competition, not harm to competitors, because competitors can be casualties of 
aggressive competition that benefits consumers and/or increases efficiency. Did 
Microsoft harm consumers in the sense that they would have faced lower prices-
adjusted for the quality and variety of the available products-in the absence of 
Microsoft's challenged conduct? 
Assessment of consumer harm from predation is difficult because predation 
can benefit consumers in the short run while harming them in the long run. For 
example, consumers were not clearly worse off in the short run as the result of 
Microsoft's <rs type="software">Java</rs> development, and some consumers may have been better off 
because Microsoft's implementation of the <rs type="software">Java</rs> virtual machine provided advan-
tages for <rs type="software">Windows</rs> users ("Performance Tests: Compatibility," 1998). 
However, what might appear to be an obvious short-term consumer benefit of 
Microsoft's allegedly predatory behavior-namely, receiving a free copy of <rs type="software">Internet 
Explorer</rs> bundled with <rs type="software">Windows</rs> rather than paying for a browser-might be 
illusory. The availability of free browsers may have allowed Microsoft to raise (or avoid 
lowering) the price of <rs type="software">Windows</rs>. To the extent that Microsoft internalized the benefits </p>

<p>11 For movement of browser market shares from 1997 to 1998, see ͗http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/ 
exhibits/5.pdf͘. Statmarket claims that <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>'s share of browser usage in June 2000 was 
more than 86 percent (Scott Clark, "Browser Statistics Look Good for IE," June 27, 2000, ͗http:// 
www.internetnews.com/wd-news/article/0,,10_403661,00.html͘. Positive Support Review estimated In-
ternet Explorer's market share at about 76 percent in July 2000, with Netscape at about 15 percent (see 
͗http://www.psrinc.com/MSExplorer.htm͘). BrowserWatch reported that 58.7 percent of the hits on its 
website in July 2000 were from Internet surfers using <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> and 26.1 percent of the hits were 
from surfers using Netscape Navigator, as reported at ͗http://browserwatch.internet.com/stats/stats. 
html͘. </p>

<p>from free browsers through the <rs type="software">Windows</rs> price, the short-run consumer benefits 
from giving away Internet Explorer and bundling it with <rs type="software">Windows</rs> were limited. 
The main thrust of the government's case was that, in the long run, consumers 
would suffer from reduced competition among both browsers and operating 
systems. The result could be higher prices in the long run, or a reduction of 
investment in R&amp;D and product development that reduced or degraded the set of 
available products. 
The need to consider long-run effects of Microsoft's actions raises a number of 
difficulties. First, there is the matter of predicting what will happen in a market 
subject to rapid technological change. One cannot be certain that the combination 
of alternative browsers and a <rs type="software">Java</rs> programming language that was independent of 
the underlying programming language would have emerged as a serious platform 
competitor absent Microsoft's challenged conduct. For example, one obstacle to 
the widespread acceptance of <rs type="software">Java</rs> is the additional execution time required to 
translate the <rs type="software">Java</rs> code. Clearly, however, Microsoft perceived that such competi-
tion was possible. 
Second, the link between the degree of competition and the degree of 
innovation is complex. Certain theoretical arguments support the conclusion that 
large firm size and high market share are conducive to R&amp;D investment, because a 
firm in such a market can amortize the fixed costs of the R&amp;D and appropriate most 
of the R&amp;D's benefits. Catastrophic entry, combined with large investment demands, 
can necessitate concentrated markets as a means to achieve the returns necessary to 
motivate large investments that must be recouped over relatively short periods of 
time before the dawning of the next technological revolution. On the other hand, 
as Sir John Hicks (1935, p. 8) wrote: "The best of all monopoly profits is a quiet 
life." There is considerable anecdotal evidence that competitive market structures 
are more innovative than are protected monopolies, although econometric evidence 
on the general linkage between concentration and innovation is inconclusive. 
While it is impossible to make definitive statements about the linkage between 
market structure and innovation in general, competition has stimulated innovation 
in browsers and operating systems. For example, Evans and Schmalensee (2000a, 
pp. 45-46) concluded that, by increasing competition in the browser market, 
"Microsoft's actions speeded innovation in Web-browsing software and left consum-
ers with the choice of two first-rate browsers instead of one." Moreover, Microsoft 
appears to have accelerated the introduction of <rs id="software-103" type="software">DOS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-103" type="version-number">5.0</rs> in response to competi-
tion from <rs type="software">DR-DOS</rs> and to have accelerated the development of <rs type="software">Windows</rs> in 
response to competition from Apple and OS/2. Further, the continuing develop-
ment of Apple's operating system suggests that significant innovation by firms with 
much smaller sales than Microsoft is feasible. 
A third difficulty in assessing the long-run consequences of Microsoft's con-
duct is that, even if one has found there would be greater competition and more 
innovation absent Microsoft's actions, as a matter of theory the linkage between 
innovation and welfare is ambiguous. For example, firms may enter rent-seeking 
races in which they invest more than the socially efficient amounts in R&amp;D (for a 
review of the theoretical literature on R&amp;D competition, see Reinganum, 1989). As </p>

<p>an empirical matter, however, private incentives for R&amp;D typically are much lower 
than the social benefits of the R&amp;D because private firms typically are unable to 
appropriate all of the benefits that their R&amp;D generates for the economy (Griliches, 
1992; Jones and Williams, 1998). Certainly, no evidence of socially excessive R&amp;D 
investment was presented at trial. 
It appears to us that if the record in the case had consisted solely of the fact that 
Microsoft took the actions the government alleged to be predatory-that is, giving 
<rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> away for free, bundling <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> with <rs type="software">Windows</rs>, and 
creating a non-standard implementation of <rs type="software">Java</rs>-Microsoft could have made a 
plausible case that it was engaged in a non-predatory squeeze of Netscape, was 
improving <rs type="software">Java</rs>, and its conduct did not harm consumers. 
There are, however, two significant problems with this interpretation of the 
record. First, there is significant evidence that Microsoft took actions for the 
explicit purpose of harming competition. Economists are often loath to endorse an 
intent-based approach to evaluating firm behavior because managers often use 
florid language to describe their actions in memoranda ("kill the competition") 
and even ill-intended actions may not harm consumers in some cases. We fully 
agree that caution is warranted in interpreting such evidence. However, when there 
is a clear economic rationale that certain types of conduct can harm competition 
and lead to higher prices, and there is evidence that managerial intent was to harm 
competitors, it can be appropriate to use this evidence to sort harmful from 
innocent behavior. Of course, one has to be sensitive to the possibility that exec-
utives will strategically write memoranda that put soothing spins on their descrip-
tions of firm conduct. 
Second, in addition to the allegedly predatory actions, Microsoft undertook a 
variety of exclusionary tactics that cannot be explained as procompetitive "squeezes" 
on Netscape. If Microsoft had been trying to maximize its returns on <rs type="software">Windows</rs> by 
ensuring that consumers enjoyed maximal benefits from complementary browsers, 
it would not have worked so hard to make it difficult for consumers to use 
non-Microsoft browsers. In particular, Microsoft would not have taken measures to 
discourage consumers from using Netscape's browser. 
Judge Jackson concluded that Microsoft's contracts with Internet and online 
service providers and with computer manufacturers were exclusionary and contrib-
uted to a verdict of monopolization. However, he also found that because the 
contracts did not completely foreclose competition from Netscape and other 
browsers, the contracts were not illegal in and of themselves. Judge Jackson's 
finding notwithstanding, imposing costs on competitors can harm consumers even 
if the competitors are not completely driven from the market. Netscape was forced 
to pursue other distribution alternatives to compensate for Microsoft's restrictive 
arrangements, thereby increasing Netscape's costs of distributing its browser to 
consumers. At least some consumers were harmed because they were unable to 
obtain their preferred product or they incurred greater costs to do so (for example, 
time spent downloading the product) as the result of Microsoft's practices. The 
contracts do not appear to have contributed to efficiencies that would offset these 
harms. Moreover, in the presence of network effects, a lower current market share </p>

<p>can have negative feedback effects on future sales and thus weaken incentives for 
product improvements and future competition. 
Neither the government nor Microsoft offered numerical projections of wel-
fare effects. Our review of the case suggests the following overall effects. In the 
short run, Microsoft's allegedly predatory actions of developing a <rs type="software">Windows</rs>-
optimized version of <rs type="software">Java</rs>, giving <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> away for free, and bundling 
Internet Explorer with Windows probably benefited consumers directly. In addi-
tion, consumers benefited from the latter two actions because they forced Netscape 
to make its browser available for free. The short-run consumer gains from a free or 
bundled browser may have been limited, however, because a zero browser price 
may have enabled Microsoft to maintain the price of <rs type="software">Windows</rs> at a higher level than 
it otherwise would have. In the short run, Microsoft's contracts with personal 
computer manufacturers and online service providers imposed costs on consumers 
who preferred the Netscape browser. In the long run, consumers were likely 
harmed because much of Microsoft's challenged conduct reduced the probability 
that Netscape/Java would emerge as a platform competitor. The contracts with 
Internet content providers, however, had potential efficiency benefits. </p>

<p>On April 3, 2000, Judge Jackson found Microsoft guilty of violating the 
Sherman Act (U.S. v. Microsoft, 2000c). The government and Microsoft then pro-
posed remedies. Both parties proposed conduct remedies that would constrain 
certain aspects of Microsoft's behavior, such as the use of exclusive contracts and 
prohibitions on removing the <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> icon. The government proposed 
more extensive conduct remedies than did Microsoft, as well as a structural dives-
titure of the company into two parts. One part would receive the <rs type="software">Windows</rs> oper-
ating system; the other would receive the applications programs and all other 
Microsoft lines of business. Both parts would get intellectual property rights to the 
Internet Explorer browser, but the operating systems company would be limited in 
its ability to develop, license, or distribute modified or derivative versions of the 
browser (U.S. v. Microsoft, 2000a, sec. 1.c). 
From an efficiency perspective, remedies should stop a firm that has engaged 
in anticompetitive conduct from continuing to do so and should deter that firm 
and others from engaging in similar anticompetitive conduct in the future. At the 
same time, remedies should not introduce large administrative costs, deter efficient 
conduct, or create opportunities for firms to engage in costly strategic behavior. 
Judge Jackson found that Microsoft illegally sustained the applications barrier 
to the entry of operating system competitors. Conduct remedies, such as mandatory 
unbundling of <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> from <rs type="software">Windows</rs>, deal directly with Microsoft's 
challenged behavior. However, as experience with the earlier consent decree 
illustrates, conduct remedies can be difficult to enforce and may not be sufficient 
to deter Microsoft from engaging in other behavior that has similar effects. In 
addition, conduct remedies may provide a forum for competitors to challenge </p>

<p>Microsoft's business decisions-including those that might benefit consumers-
with a potentially chilling effect on innovation. 
Compared to conduct requirements, structural remedies typically require less 
regulatory oversight and can be less susceptible to strategic intervention by com-
petitors. But structural remedies may fail if the required structure does not reflect 
an efficient organization of the industry. 
The government's theory was that its proposed structural remedy would invig-
orate competition by encouraging the applications company to port its software to 
other operating systems or to develop its own operating system. In either case, 
Windows would face more vigorous competition. The breakup was also intended to 
encourage the operating system company to assure interoperability with applica-
tions programs from all vendors. More generally, each company would have 
incentives to encourage competition in the market for the complementary product. 
By relying on market forces, the proposed remedy sidesteps the prospect of 
continuing government oversight of Microsoft. It does not order the applications 
division to work with other operating systems vendors. It does not seek to define 
terms like "operating system" and then set up restrictions about what such a system 
can or cannot include. It does not contain permanent line-of-business restrictions 
on the Microsoft offspring. 12 
However, the proposed breakup of a huge company would certainly entail 
substantial direct costs of reorganization. Moreover, the divestiture might well 
impose indirect costs through its effects on the two companies' abilities and 
incentives to cooperate, including cooperation in pricing and product develop-
ment. The concern with respect to pricing is the "double marginalization problem" 
identified by Cournot (1838). Suppose that every consumer of a personal computer 
requires one operating system and one application program (for example, a word 
processor). If the monopoly supplier of the operating system is also the monopoly 
supplier of the application, it will take foregone application sales into account when 
analyzing the effects of an increase in the price of the operating system. But if a 
separate firm sells the application, the operating system monopolist will not count 
lost application sales as a cost and thus has less incentive to restrain price. A similar 
logic applies to pricing the application. Hence, this argument suggests that the sum 
of the operating system and application prices set by an integrated monopolist will 
be lower than the sum of those prices when set separately by two independent firms 
each with significant market power. 
The separation of suppliers of complementary products can have other nefar-
ious effects. The separate operating system and applications companies might not 
have incentives to push new products that require commitments from both the 
operating system and application sides of the business. The introduction of Win-
dows provides a suggestive case study. Microsoft had a strong incentive to design 
and market applications that took advantage of the <rs type="software">Windows</rs> graphical user inter-</p>

<p>face, because Microsoft could internalize benefits from the complementarities 
between Windows and applications. Independent companies, such as Lotus, were 
slower to make the transition to <rs type="software">Windows</rs> for their applications than was Microsoft. 
It is impossible to predict with confidence how splitting Microsoft in two would 
actually work and how large any coordination losses would be. The two companies 
would have incentives to reach agreements to overcome the distortions induced by 
their separate structure, subject to being allowed to do so by the remedy and antitrust 
law generally. More broadly, the hope of the government is that divestiture would 
invigorate competition in both the operating systems and applications markets. If 
stronger competition occurred, it would reduce the double marginalization problem 
and could even reduce the total price of software bundles from current levels. 
Some have argued for a structural remedy that would create immediate 
additional competition in the market for personal computer operating systems by 
breaking Microsoft into an applications company and several competing operating 
systems companies, often referred to as the "Baby Bills." (The friend-of-the-court 
submission, U.S. v. Microsoft, 2000e, is an example.) Such a proposal offers the 
benefit of eliminating, or at least greatly reducing, the operating systems market 
power that was the driving force for anticompetitive conduct. However, this pro-
posal also raises substantial risks of imposing an inefficient market structure be-
cause the efficient number of personal computer operating systems companies is 
unknown. Moreover, the relationship between innovation and market structure is 
not a simple one. If market forces compelled three Baby Bills to remain compatible 
with each other, innovation might be limited by the rigidities inherent in a 
multi-firm effort to preserve standards. Alternatively, a failure among the Baby Bills 
to cooperate on standards could lead to fragmentation and the loss of network 
effects. Finally, there are no clear organizational lines along which to cut the 
operating system company into multiple pieces. 
Financial penalties are another potential remedy for unlawful conduct. Except 
to compensate for harm suffered in its role as a consumer, the government cannot 
pursue monetary damages in civil litigation. But private parties can do so and have 
the added incentive of possibly receiving treble damages. While monetary damages 
have the disadvantage that they do not directly address the conduct at issue, they 
can serve as a deterrent to future conduct that likely would be found to harm 
competition. Moreover, monetary damages create neither large administrative costs 
nor opportunities for strategic behavior (although litigation to obtain such dam-
ages can give rise to both). 
In any event, Judge Jackson accepted the government's proposed remedies-
including the breakup-although he immediately stayed their implementation 
pending appeals (U.S. v. Microsoft, 2000d). </p>

<p>) imaging flow cytometer. This modi-
fication has allowed for a similar number of BNCs to be automatically scored as com-
pared to traditional microscopy in a much shorter time period. However, the MN 
frequency measured was much lower than both manual and automated slide-based meth-
ods of performing the assay. This work describes the optimized analysis template which 
implements newly developed functions in the <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> 
V R data analysis software for the IS </p>

<p>as high fever, infection and bleeding will manifest themselves 
within a few days of exposure and medical treatment is likely 
to begin before dose estimates from biodosimetry are avail-
able. However, below this threshold these physical symptoms 
may not appear for several weeks and as such, rapid and accu-
rate dose estimations for individuals exposed to doses below 
the LD 50 is essential. 
The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay is fre-
quently used in radiation biodosimetry to estimate unknown 
doses by correlating the rate of micronuclei (MN) per 
binucleated cell (BNC) in peripheral blood lymphocytes to a 
dose (4,5). The assay is traditionally performed using manual 
microscopy and is capable of generating accurate and repro-
ducible dose estimations between 0.3 and 4 Gy (6-8). A num-
ber of studies have illustrated that linear-quadratic dose 
response calibration curves can be obtained using automated 
or semi-automated slide scoring with the <rs id="software-24" type="software">MNScore</rs> software 
module on the Metafer slide scanning platform (<rs corresp="#software-24" type="creator">MetaSystems</rs>, 
Germany) (7-10). The results of these works indicated that 
the overall MN frequency in these curves was reduced at 
higher doses (3 or 4 Gy) by a factor between one and a half 
and three when compared to manual slide scoring. The 
reduced number of MN in automated slide scoring appears to 
be related to the strictness of scoring criteria in image analysis 
that can cause MN that would be typically scored manually to 
be missed. For example, MN that are in very close proximity 
to the main nucleus may be missed by automated systems 
(8,10). This is a limitation to the sensitivity of the assay and 
its applicability in the low dose region; however, it is less of an 
issue for rapid dose estimation in the higher dose regions. 
A traditional flow cytometry based version of the MN 
assay in the field of toxicology has been previously described 
(11) and over the last several years has been configured into a 
commercially available kit by Litron Laboratories (12-15) that 
can be performed on a number of cell lines including mouse 
lymphoma and TK6 cells. In this method, MN are liberated 
through lysis of the cell membrane and scored through appli-
cation of a data analysis template that differentiates MN from 
the main nuclei. The increase in the number of MN can be 
directly correlated to the toxicity of various compounds and 
the method has had considerable success in the field of toxi-
cology. One of the limitations of this assay, however, is the 
generation of false positives by apoptosis inducing com-
pounds that are not necessarily genotoxic (14) thus requiring 
validation by manual microscopy. Furthermore, this method 
is not directly applicable to radiation biodosimetry. In the 
CBMN assay for radiation biodosimetry, the fundamental 
parameter of measure is the rate of MN per BNC in human 
lymphocyte cells in first mitosis (16). To quantify this parame-
ter, MN must be scored inside the cytoplasm of a BNC and 
therefore, the Litron Laboratories method is less than ideal. 
A novel method recently developed by our group (17-19) 
uses imaging flow cytometry (FCM) on the ImageStream </p>

<p>labelled with fluorescent dyes and are passed in suspension 
through the flow cell of the cytometer. In the IS 
X , a bright-
field (BF) LED light source and at least one solid state laser 
(405, 488, and 658 nm in our system) orthogonally interro-
gate each cell, creating transmitted and scattered light signals. 
The transmitted and scattered light is collected by one of three 
high numerical aperture lenses (203, 403, or 603) and 
undergoes spectral decomposition into specific wavelength 
ranges within roughly 400-800 nm. The wavelength ranges 
are then focused onto separate channels of a charge-coupled 
device (CCD) camera that takes the place of photomultiplier 
tubes found in traditional flow cytometers. Each channel cap-
tures optically divided sub-images which can be viewed indi-
vidually or can be combined to view the co-location of several 
signals. In this way, the IS 
X generates high resolution imagery 
for each cell that passes through the instrument that allows 
for visual confirmation of micronucleus identification 
(20-22). This is a substantial advantage over traditional FCM 
methods. 
The IS 
X is capable of capturing high-resolution images of 
individual cells at a rate of up to 5,000 cells per second. The 
new IS 
X -CBMN method is able to process cell samples sus-
pended in solution and eliminates the need to create micro-
scope slides, thereby reducing the time required for sample 
preparation (17-19). All images captured on the IS 
X are saved 
to a data file which is analyzed using the Image Data Explora-
tion and Analysis Software (<rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> 
V R ) built specifically for the 
IS 
X . Previously, we generated dose response calibration curves 
from 0-4 Gy (17,19) and 0-10 Gy (18) but in both cases, while 
a large number of BNCs were scored (about 2,000), a reduc-
tion in MN frequency by a factor of about 5-10 was observed 
when compared to curves generated by automated and man-
ual slide-scoring methods respectively. 
This paper describes the optimization of the <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> anal-
ysis template for identifying and scoring BNCs and MN in the 
IS 
X -based version of the CBMN assay. In this work, we re-
analyzed existing data in order to demonstrate improvements 
in the accuracy of identifying and separating BNCs from other 
cells and cellular debris, as well as improved detection of MN 
through the use of a newly developed MN mask. The resulting 
increase in MN frequency is evident in the improved dose 
response calibration curve in which the rate of MN per BNC 
is comparable in magnitude to those presented by other 
authors using automated slide-scoring versions of the CBMN 
assay. Finally the improved accuracy of the template is evi-
denced by the re-analysis of blinded samples to generate dose 
estimations to within 60.5 Gy of the delivered dose following 
only 5 minutes of data collection on the IS 
X . </p>

<p>BNC and MN Mask Development and Gating Strategy 
in <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> 
In <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs>, a mask identifies pixels within a defined region 
of in an image. Optimized BNC and MN masks were devel-
oped by applying and combining several new and existing 
mask functions in <rs id="software-7" type="software">IDEAS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">version 6.2</rs>). The steps to create 
both masks are outlined below. 
The BNC mask was optimized to better delineate pixels 
in the main nuclei to allow more precise classification of 
BNCs based on the intensity, shape, and size of individual 
nuclei. This was achieved by applying three sequential mask </p>

<p>Gating Strategy in <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> 
To filter, identify and score BNCs and MN, an opti-
mized analysis template using new features and image 
masks developed by Amnis 
V R was created in <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs>. To </p>

<p>
quantitate the gating process, separate populations contain-
ing 100 BNCs and 100 non-BNCs were selected at each dose 
point for one donor by manually highlighting (tagging) 
images from the original unfiltered population without vis-
ualizing the analysis area in <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs>. This ensured unbiased 
selection of images. BNCs and non-BNCs were tagged 
according to the traditional scoring criteria described by 
Fenech et al. (9). These events (BNCs, yellow; non-BNCs, 
blue) were then identified on each panel in Figure 3 such 
that they could be tracked sequentially through the tem-
plate. This allowed gate dimensions to be optimized such 
that no more than 10% of the BNC population was gated 
out in any plot and as many as possible non-BNC events 
were gated out. Details of the features, functions, masks and 
gating strategies used to optimize the data analysis template 
are summarized in Table 1. To automatically count the fre-
quency of MN within the final BNC population, the SPOT 
COUNT feature was applied to the newly developed MN 
mask and a histogram of MN frequency was generated </p>

<p>Dose Response Calibration Curves and Blinded 
Samples 
Six independent experiments with six different donors 
were carried out in a previous study to generate a dose 
response calibration curve (18). In the current study, the data 
files from that work were re-analyzed with the optimized 
<rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> template described above to demonstrate improve-
ment in detection and scoring of BNCs and MN. 
One-hundred BNC and one-hundred non-BNC events 
were tagged in data files across the 0-4 Gy dose range for one 
donor in order to illustrate the efficiency with which each gate 
filtered these populations by incorporating the BNC scoring cri-
teria described by Fenech et al. (9). Their distribution is dem-
onstrated in Figure 3 and Table 2 provides supporting statistics 
across the dose range for both the original and optimized gating </p>

<p>and masking strategies. The optimized <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> analysis template 
demonstrates an improvement across the dose range in BNC 
detection accuracy, recovering 25% of the tagged BNCs elimi-
nated with the original template, and eliminating 83% of tagged 
non-BNCs retained with the original template. On average, 849 
BNCs were scored across the 0-4 Gy dose range for each donor 
at each data point (Table 2), a reduction of a factor of about 
three as compared to the 2647 BNCs identified by the original 
BNC mask on average across the dose range. This reduction 
demonstrates that the gating strategy more effectively filters 
unwanted events and that the optimized BNC mask is more 
selective of true BNCs within the final population. Further-
more, Table 2 demonstrates that the optimized MN mask iden-
tified more MN (an average of 99 MN across the dose range) 
than the original MN mask (an average of 87 MN across the 
dose range) despite the fact that fewer BNCs were identified, </p>

<p>illustrating an increase in sensitivity of the optimized MN 
mask. 
Figure 5A presents the rate of MN per BNC as a function 
of dose for all six donors, the average rate of MN per BNC at 
the 95% confidence intervals as determined in Matlab (ver-
sion 7.11.0.584, <rs corresp="#software-25" type="creator">Mathworks</rs>, MA). A quadratic increase with 
dose up to 4 Gy is expected from biological considerations 
(3), historical work on the CBMN assay (4,5,23) and from our 
previous work with IS 
X -CBMN method (17-19) and was 
observed in this work. At 0 Gy, the average rate of MN per 
BNC at 0 Gy for all six donors was 0.022 which was within the 
0-0.040 range typical of background MN frequencies (24). 
Variability in the rate of MN per BNC with increasing dose, 
which was observed in our previous work (17-19), was once 
again observed here as the rate of MN per BNC varied 
between approximately 0.30-0.45 for all donors at 4 Gy. </p>

template is also shown (18). The numbers of BNCs and MN scored are also shown for one donor across the dose range from both the opti-
mized and original analysis templates </p>

However, the deviation from the average rate of MN per BNC 
was calculated to be only 15% on average for all donors across 
the dose range, compared to 26% in our previous work (18). 
The average rate of MN per BNC (Y) as a function of dose

dose estimations from our previous work (19) (black squares),

the estimated dose would be equal (dashed line) as well as the

mined using <rs id="software-27" type="software">CABAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-27" type="version-number">v2</rs> (Chromosome Aberration Calculation 
Software) (28) and the error bars represent the standard errors 
(SE) on the dose estimations. Figure 5C illustrates that after 
40 min of data collection, the newly optimized analysis tem-
plate was able to estimate blinded doses to within 0.5 Gy of 
the delivered dose in all but the 0.73 Gy sample (0.59 Gy 
higher than the delivered dose). The error bars associated 
with each data point are also within the 60.5 Gy lines in all 
but the 0.73 Gy sample. On average, 1,873 BNCs were scored 
for each sample after 40 minutes of data collection. 
Figure 5D illustrates that after only 5 min of data collec-
tion, optimized analysis template was able to correctly esti-
mate more blinded samples to within 0.5 Gy of the delivered 
dose than was possible with the original analysis template.

represent 60.5 Gy from the ideal slope. The error bars represent the standard error on the estimated dose. </p>

<p>In several recent publications, we have introduced a 
newly developed method for performing the CBMN assay 
using imaging FCM as a dose estimation tool in radiation bio-
dosimetry (17-19). In the present study, we developed a new 
analysis strategy using mask functions recently implemented 
in <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs>, and evaluated the performance of this analysis 
compared to our previous approach. First, hand-tagged truth 
populations (BNC and non-BNC, MN, and non-MN events) 
were selected which allowed for the identification of features 
that were able to distinguish between these populations. 
Direct visualization of the locations of these populations (Fig. 
3) also allowed for ranges of all features to be optimized. Sec-
ond, we discovered that an analysis template optimized for a 
single data file was, in many cases, not ideal for all conditions. 
By merging data collected from multiple donors at multiple 
dose points, the most optimized analysis template for all data 
files was achieved. Finally, data collected from blinded samples 
was used to confirm the accuracy of the optimized analysis. 
These strategies enabled us to substantially increase the com-
parability of this assay to previous published results in the lit-
erature and improve accuracy when generating dose 
estimations compared to our previous work. 
Figure 3 shows the sequential application of bivariate 
plots and histograms in the analysis template and demon-
strates the effectiveness with which BNCs could be separated 
from cellular debris and other undesired objects in the data 
acquired by the IS 
X . While identification of focused, single 
cells can be attained from the BF images, the addition of a 
DRAQ5 nuclear stain also allows apoptotic cells to be gated 
out based on the hallmarks of apoptosis (chromatin conden-
sation, nuclear condensation, and increased blebbing) without 
the use of an additional viability dye (13). All DRAQ5 stained 
BNCs were shown to fall between 1 3 10 
5 AU and 1 3 10 
6 AU 
of intensity indicating that the main nuclei show a relatively 
uniform uptake of DRAQ5. This result may allow for 
improved data collection to be obtained through the applica-
tion of more stringent intensity classifiers on the IS 
X which 
would filter out more unwanted events during acquisition. 
Furthermore, the newly created BNC mask was able to better 
differentiate images with two DRAQ5 stained objects from 
those with zero, one or three or more DRAQ5 stained objects 
compared to the previous versions of the <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> template. 
Several of the new features developed in <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> that simulta-
neously compare the main nuclei to one another based on cir-
cularity, size, staining intensity and symmetry, allowed BNCs 
to be further differentiated from other undesired events. By 
implementing these cell-specific parameters in the <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> 
template, 99% of the tagged non-BNCs were correctly filtered 
from the final population on average across the dose range. In 
addition, 25% of the tagged BNCs eliminated with the origi-</p>

<p>nal template were recovered and 83% of the tagged non-BNCs 
retained with the original template were eliminated. 
Figure 5 demonstrates that the optimized <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> analysis 
template generates a dose response calibration curve that is of 
similar magnitude to those presented in the literature and that 
the dose estimations from blinded samples generated using 
this curve are more accurate. The rate of MN per BNC as a 
function of dose demonstrates some variability between 
donors. This variability in the CBMN assay has been well 
documented in the literature and Kacprzak et al. (29) showed 
that for five donors, the rate of MN per 1,000 BNC was rela-
tively consistent at 0 Gy but had an approximate range of 0.2-
0.6 at 5 Gy. While the variability between donors across the 
dose range has been reduced in this work to 15% compared to 
26% in our previous analysis template (18), the need for gen-
erating a calibration curve that is based on the rate of MN per 
BNC from multiple donors is demonstrated. In addition, the 
magnitude of the rate of MN per BNC in this work has 
increased by a factor of about four in comparison to our pre-
vious work, on average, across the dose range, illustrating the 
effectiveness of the optimized BNC and MN masks. In previ-
ous versions of the <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> analysis template, MN close to the 
main nuclei and smaller MN could not be scored due to the 
limitations in the available masking parameters, however the 
optimized MN mask is now able to correctly score these 
events which has led to the observed improvement. 
In order to determine if the improvement in BNC and 
MN identification corresponded to an increase in accuracy 
when generating dose estimations, data acquired from nine 
samples previously irradiated and blinded (19) were re-
analyzed. Figure 5C demonstrates that the optimized <rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> 
analysis template was able to correctly estimate eight of the 
nine doses to within 0.5 Gy after 40 min of data collection, 
with only the 0.73 Gy sample falling outside the 60.5 Gy 
limits. Figure 5D illustrates the improved accuracy of the 
optimized analysis template and demonstrates that dose esti-
mations for seven of the nine doses were correct to within 
0.5 Gy after only 5 min of data collection. This is a signifi-
cant improvement over the original analysis template which 
was only able to correctly estimate three of the nine doses to 
within 0.5 Gy following 5 min of data collection. On average, 
280 BNCs were scored for each blinded sample after only 5 
min of data collection, but in some cases, &lt;200 BNCs were 
scored. McNamee et al. have previously recommended that 
200 BNCs be scored to provide reliable dose estimations 
(23). Furthermore, in a recent publication De Amicis et al. 
were able to successfully identify doses up to 4 Gy, within 0.5 
Gy of the delivered dose by scoring only 100 BNCs (30). The 
results of this work are consistent with the results of De Ami-
cis et al. and demonstrate that scoring approximately 100 
BNCs was sufficient to produce accurate dose estimations 
between 0 and 4 Gy. Overall, this demonstrates that the new 
<rs type="software">IDEAS</rs> analysis template is able to provide dose estimations 
with acceptable accuracy (within 60.5 Gy) after only 5 min 
of data collection and in some cases, after scoring only 100 
BNCs. </p>

<p>of the ECB provides extensive information regarding the value of properties owned. 
In addition, the EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living 
Conditions) contains information on property taxes currently paid. In order to conduct 
our simulation, we match the two representative survey microdatasets. Performing a 
number of validity checks we show that especially on a more aggregate level such as 
household income deciles, the matched dataset preserves the properties of the original 
HFCS dataset sufficiently well. 
The matched dataset is then used to simulate a property tax reform that applies 
current market values instead of cadastral values. In a first scenario, we assess the 
potential revenue gain induced by the use of up-to-date property values. Next, we 
simulate a revenue-neutral scenario in which the additional revenue is used to lower 
social insurance contributions (SIC) via a lump sum SIC credit. As a third scenario, 
we simulate a proportional reduction of social insurance contributions, again under 
revenue neutrality. All simulations are carried out using <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs>-the tax-benefit 
microsimulation model for EU member states. It allows us to evaluate changes in 
households' disposable income induced by the different scenarios. Our baseline sim-
ulations focus on first-order effects of the three reform scenarios. In addition, we also 
discuss the relevance of second-order effects in our context, and provide robustness 
checks in the Appendix accounting for potential labor supply responses. 
From a budgetary perspective, our simulations suggest that the revenue from prop-
erty taxation would rise from currently e 5.8 bil. to e 16.3 bil. This additional revenue 
would allow a reduction of the implicit tax rate on labor from currently 37.2 to 36.5%. 
Examining distributive effects, our results first indicate that the (average) percentage 
increase in the property tax liability is roughly constant across the income distribution 
of property owners. Hence, the relative size of the property tax liability across the 
income distribution of homeowners is by and large preserved. Second, when examin-
ing the effect of the proposed update of cadastral values (again without redistributing 
the additional revenue) across the entire income distribution, we find that the relative 
change in disposable income varies little across income deciles. Thus, an update of 
cadastral values without using the additional revenue to lower the tax burden on labor 
would render such a reform virtually neutral in terms of redistribution. 
Finally, we turn toward the two revenue-neutral scenarios in which the additional 
tax receipts are used to lower the tax burden on labor income. We find that when 
a lump sum SIC credit is granted, all household deciles would gain in disposable 
income except for the top three ones. In contrast, when using the additional revenue 
for a proportional reduction of social insurance contributions, the effect on disposable 
income is small and relatively similar across the income distribution. In sum, we find 
for both scenarios that more households would gain than lose from the tax shift, with 
gainers mostly situated in the middle of the income distribution. </p>

<p>Our results relate to the existing literature in a number of ways. First, several pro-
posals have been made to increase tax revenues from wealth and property (e.g., Bach 
et al. 2014; Piketty 2014). Our paper adds to this literature by assessing the revenue 
potential of an important policy tool, namely an up-to-date valuation of the property tax 
base. As mentioned above, outdated cadastral values determine property tax liability 
not only in Germany but also in several other European countries, making our results 
also relevant for other jurisdictions (see OECD 2014; Andrews et al. 2011). Further-
more, previous authors have pointed out that the redistributive element of the German 
property tax in its current form is rather limited (Bach and Schratzenstaller 2013). 
Our results support this view and indicate that this would not be substantially different 
once cadastral values are updated. In fact, our findings suggest that the potential for 
redistribution (if desired by the legislator) depends on the simultaneous reduction of 
the tax burden on labor. 
In addition, our results speak to the literature analyzing the distributive effects of tax 
shifts from labor income toward other tax bases such as consumption (e.g., Pestel and 
Sommer 2017). So far, little empirical work has been dedicated to property tax related 
simulations, mostly driven by data limitations. A notable exception is Moscarola et al. 
(2015), assessing labor market reactions to a property and labor tax reform in Italy. In a 
similar vein, Figari et al. (2017) investigate the fiscal and distributional consequences of 
including homeowners' imputed rent in personal taxable income as a kind of property 
tax for six European countries. Using up-to-date property values to determine property 
taxes could be regarded as an important complement (and maybe even as a substitute 
depending on the specific design) to housing income taxation. Finally, Kuypers et al. 
(2017) currently create a <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs> input database directly from the HFCS dataset. 
Their approach aims at broadening the scope of <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs> by including information 
on wealth from HFCS, but they do not combine this with EU-SILC data. The novelty of 
our paper is the creation of a new dataset via statistical matching that allows analyses 
regarding two variables which have never been jointly observed, namely the current 
property tax liability and the actual market value of the property. Our approach may 
potentially be extended to other European countries covered by <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs>, providing 
a fruitful avenue for further research. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 illustrates the insti-
tutional background of property taxes in Germany. Section 3 describes the matching 
procedure which combines the two datasets. An analysis of the quality and validity 
of the matched dataset is provided in Sect. 4. The simulated tax reform and its dis-
tributional and revenue effects are described in Sect. 5. The final section contains a 
conclusive discussion of our results. </p>

<p>5.1 The tax-benefit model <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs> </p>

<p>Our policy reform simulations are performed on <rs id="software-5" type="software">EUROMOD</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">version G2.0</rs>), the 
tax-benefit microsimulation model designed for EU member states. It applies national 
tax-benefit policy rules to harmonized microdata and calculates their effects on house-
hold disposable income (Sutherland and Figari 2013). Unlike computable general 
equilibrium (CGE) approaches, the only assumptions we impose concern our pro-
posed reform scenarios, or the elasticity of labor supply. Our approach is in the spirit 
of recent research, for instance on fiscal sustainability (Dolls et al. 2017), income dis-
tribution analysis (Bargain et al. 2015), or mortgage interest deductibility (Figari et al. 
2017). Thus, we follow well-established simulation techniques using EUROMOD, </p>

<p>allowing for inferences about the distributional and revenue effects of a tax shift from 
labor to property. 
The German component of <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs> reproducing the 2010 German tax-benefit 
system has been validated through comparison with aggregate statistics provided by 
fiscal authorities (Ochmann and Granados 2011). We run all tax-benefit policy rules at 
their 2010 setting and then augment the model with a simulated change in property and 
labor taxation. Hence, our simulation model calculates household disposable income 
under the current as well as the reformed tax-benefit rules holding everything else 
constant and, therefore, avoiding endogeneity problems (Bourguignon and Spadaro 
2006). 
In general, our analysis focuses on first-order effects of the simulated reform. How-
ever, there may also be second-order responses to the proposed tax policy changes. 
For instance, it seems plausible that the proposed reduction in social insurance con-
tributions on labor income affects labor supply. Therefore, we provide an additional 
analysis in Appendix B which takes such behavioral responses into account. 12 Finally, </p>

<p>as endogenous. 
18 We also treat Chinese aid and FDI to Africa as exogenous. As 
pointed out by Kolstad and Wiig (2011), Chinese FDI to Africa is not attracted 
by GDP as soon as South Africa is excluded from the sample. Predominately, 
Chinese FDI (and aid) is concentrated in African countries with large resource 
endowments, which is exogenous. 
Using a large number of instruments may overfit endogenous variables and 
may weaken the Hansen J-test of the instruments' joint validity. To keep the 
number of instruments at a minimum, we use the collapse option in <rs id="software-1" type="software">STATA</rs> in 
all regressions (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Roodman</rs>, 2009). 
19 This ensures that the number of instruments 
is always well below the number of countries. Overall, the results, reported in 
Table 2, are broadly in line with the fixed-effects results. The lagged dependent 
variable is always significant at the one percent level. Depending on the model 
specification, the estimated coefficient is slightly above or below one, implying 
no strong evidence for convergence in sub-Saharan African countries. This find-
ing is in line with the results of McCoskey (2002), who also found no conver-
gence for economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, although smaller 
"convergence clubs" do exist. 
In five out of six model specifications, investment has a positive and signifi-
cant impact on economic growth. In contrast to the fixed effects results, total 
African exports to the ROW are not significant. Importantly, total imports from 
China and non-resource imports from China have -as before -a negative and 
significant impact on growth. This implies that we do observe displacement 
effects of African products by Chinese imports, even if we control for endogeneity. 
While changes in the terms-of-trade are no longer positively associated with growth 
(apart from one model specification), both interaction terms with terms-of-trade 
growth are positive and significant at the five or ten percent level. This result under-
lines the importance of changes in the terms-of-trade with respect to economic 
growth when looking at African exports of natural resources to China. 
The test statistics for the system GMM estimator (Hansen J-test) indicate that 
the instruments used are valid. However, we do have econometric problems 
regarding autocorrelation. The system GMM estimator requires high first-order 
but no second-order autocorrelation. While the p-values for the AR(2) indicate 
that, indeed, we do not have second-order autocorrelation, the corresponding 
p-values for the AR(1) show that we cannot reject the null hypothesis, in three 
out of six model specifications, though the p-values are only slightly above 
0.10 in two model specifications. These results thus have to be viewed with 
caution. Still, all test statistics for our preferred model specifications (Columns 
5 and 6) indicate that the estimations are valid. </p>

<p>Microscopy experiments typically used 8-well 
microscope chambered slides and a Nikon Eclipse 
TE-2000 U epifluorescence microscope equipped with 
blue DAPI (Exciter: D360/40x, Dichroic: 400DCLP, 
Emitter: 460/50m), green FITC (Exciter: D360/40X,

deep-red Cy5 (Exciter: HQ620/60X, Dichroic: 660LP, 
Emitter: HQ700/75m) filters. Images were acquired 
using a Photometrics 512 B black and white digital

analyzed and prepared using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageJ</rs> open source

<p>Aliquots (1 mL) from separate cultures of ten 
different strains of bacteria (grown to OD 600 = 0.5) 
were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 minutes. The pellets 
were washed with and then resuspended in 1 mL of 
10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). The bacterial disper-
sions were added to separate glass slides and each 
slide sample was treated with one of four Tet-
ra-ZnDPA probes (10 µM); 15 minutes later multiple 
brightfield image fields were acquired of each of the 
forty probe/bacteria samples. Using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software, 
five digital images of each bacteria/probe sample 
were randomly selected; the bacterial clusters within 
each image field were digitally encircled as regions of 
interest and the average area of these clusters was 
calculated. For each strain of bacteria, the average 
cluster size induced by each of the four different 
probes was normalized by setting the largest ob-
served cluster size to a relative value of 1.0. The final 
results listed in Table 1. </p>

<p>sterile growth media was injected into the right rear 
leg. The mice were then allowed to recover for 3 hours 
before 
intravenous 
injection 
with 
either 
Bis-SR-bZnDPA or Tetra-SR-bZnDPA (10 nmol in 
water) via the tail vein. Fluorescent dorsal images of 
the anesthetized mice were acquired for 5 s (Ex 640 ± 
25, Em 732 ± 37 nm, binning 2 x 2, f/stop 2, 
field-of-view 125 mm), using a Xenogen IVIS Lumina 
that generated 16-bit TIFF format files. Re-
gion-of-interest analysis of the in vivo images was 
performed using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software and circling the ap-
propriate anatomical location of each mouse. The av-
erage pixel intensities of the target (T), non-target 
(NT), and were measured and statistical analyses of 
the cohort produced an average ratio for T/NT with a 
standard error of the mean. 
After imaging studies, the mice were anesthe-
tized by isoflurane inhalation (2-3 % v/v) and eu-
thanized by cervical dislocation. The major organs 
were dissected, placed on low reflectance paper, and 
imaged using the same fluorescence settings de-
scribed above. The biodistribution was determined by 
region-of-interest analysis using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software. 
Free-hand shapes were drawn around each organ and 
mean pixel intensity values were measured. The dif-
ferent organs attenuate a probe's deep-red emission 
intensity to a slightly different degree, depending on 
tissue thickness and pigmentation. The biodistribu-
tion analysis in Figure 8 assumes that fluorescence 
from both probes in a specific organ suffer the same 
amount of signal attenuation and thus, the average 
pixel intensities reflect relative probe concentration in 
the organ. </p>

<p>Measles virus genotyping was performed at the National Micro-

(PHAC) on appropriate clinical specimens (respiratory speci-
mens, urines, and viral isolates) collected from suspect measles 
cases. RNA was extracted using either the RNeasy Mini kit 
(Qiagen), QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen), or the MPLC 
Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit -High Performance (Roche) 
automated on the MagNA Pure LC 2.0 (Roche). The World 
Health Organization (WHO) standardized genotyping region 
[14], and the 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxyl-terminus 
of the measles nucleoprotein was amplified by one-step reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction ([RT-PCR] OneStep 
RT-PCR kit; Qiagen). Amplicons were purified and sequenced 
by the Genomics Core Services section at the NML. Contigs 
were prepared using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SeqMan Pro</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">DNASTAR</rs>) software. The 
resulting sequences were aligned with WHO genotype reference

<p>automated query, a clinician reviewed all surgeries 
meeting inclusion criteria during one week in April 2008 
(N¼30), searching for appropriate medication orders 
and documentation of drug administration or evidence 
of compression device application. The automated query 
accurately captured 100% of menu usage, medication 
orders and compression device orders, but missed some 
documentation of compression device application. In 
three instances (10% of cases reviewed), the documen-
tation was captured in scanned ICU flowsheets, but not 
the chart notes. The automated database queries were 
incapable of extracting content from scanned docu-
ments. To establish external validity, the team compared 
local findings to facility data collected and scored by 
independent auditors (ie, national EPRP contractors). 
The compliance rate for 35 randomly selected charts was 
identical (compliance¼77%). 
To measure a potential relationship between use of the 
new menu and change in facility performance, we 
applied Pearson's correlation between the proportion of 
cases with recommended prophylaxis ordered and the 
use of the new order menu. All statistics were performed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 14.0</rs>. </p>

<p>Data analysis was performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Tint</rs> analysis software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Axona</rs>, UK). The collected waveforms from the system unit </p>

<p>were displayed as clusters by plotting the peak-to-peak amplitude 
of each spike on one electrode against that on each of the other 
three. The clusters were isolated initially by hand. Complex 
spike cells with one or two firing fields were separated on the 
basis of spike shape, firing rate, and firing location. At least 50 
spikes were isolated for each cluster. Once the cluster was iso-
lated, a boundary of cluster was automatically generated by <rs id="software-1" type="software">Tint</rs> 
software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Axona</rs>, UK). Then the same boundary was applied for 
cluster cutting in all other trials. After the cluster cutting, firing 
rate maps for each cell were visualized and smoothed using <rs type="software">Tint</rs>, 
which divided the camera view arena into 64 3 64 square bins 
with a side length of 2.5 cm. The firing rate for a given cell in 
each bin indicated the spike number divided by dwell time in 
that bin. The firing rate maps were presented in color with a 
lowest firing rate (i.e., 0 Hz) in blue and the highest in red. 
Place field was defined as the contiguous group of pixels possess-
ing a firing rate higher than half of the peak firing rate and cov-
ering &lt;60% of the size of the recording arena. If a place cell 
was identified with one or more place fields, recordings were 
repeated two to three time on the same day and at least once 
more on the second day to verify its stability. If no qualified cell 
activity was identified, the tetrodes were advanced 25-50 mm 
and rats were returned to their home cages for at least 2 h. The 
maximum movement of tetrodes per day was 150 mm. 
For each place cell, the firing rate map for each trial was exam-
ined to determine: (1) place field size; (2) average firing rate; (3) 
peak firing rate; (4) mean infield firing rate; (5) mean outfield fir-
ing rate; (6) spatial information content; and (7) spatial coher-
ence. The size of the place field was calculated as the percentage 
of the recording arena by the place field. The average firing rate 
was determined by dividing the number of spikes that occurred 
over the entire trial by the duration of the trial. The peak firing 
rate was determined as the highest firing rate of all pixels within 
the place field of the cell. Mean infield and outfield firing rates 
were defined as the mean values for the firing rates of all pixels 
within (infield) and outside (outfield) the place field. The spatial 
information content, measured in bits/spike, is a measure of how 
much information about the spatial location of the animal is con-
tained within the activity of the cell. It was calculated using the 
methods described by Skaggs et al. (1993). Spatial coherence is a 
measure of the spatial contiguity of the neuron's activity. It deter-
mines the "smoothness" of place fields in firing ratemaps. It was 
calculated in steps described by Muller and Kubie (1989). 
The similarity between firing ratemaps in each pair of trials was 
analyzed using a correlation procedure as follows. Each map was 
decomposed into a 32 3 32-element matrix. Each pixel in one 
matrix was correlated, by a Pearson's correlation, with its equivalent 
pixel in the second map. Pixels with a zero firing rate in both met-
rics were discarded. Correlation measures were not applied to trial-
pairs, in which cells turned on/off due to remapping. </p>

Analysis 
The participants were divided in to two groups of 
"stayer" (n=12) and "quitter" (n=6). "Stayers" were 
athletes who have practiced karate throughout the 
previous 18 months for three or more days a week. 
"Quitters" were adolescents who stopped exercising 
karate for at least 6 months and were not willing to 
start again. The "quitter" group was questioned about 
the reason of quitting karate. There were four choices:

In order to compare anger scores of "stayer" and 
"quitter" groups at the start or end of the study, 
independent t-test was used, and paired t-test was used 
to study the changes of anger score with time. <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs>

Images for FRAP experiments were acquired on a custom-built setup from Till 
Photonics based on an iMic stand with Olympus 1.45 NA Â 100 objective and 
iXON DU-897 EMCCD camera. Four hundred eighty-eight nanometre (Coherent) 
and 561 nm (Cobolt) lasers were directed through an AOTF and coupled into the 
iMic. A galvanometer allowed switching between FRAP and epifluorescence 
modes. Two additional galvanometers were used to adjust laser incidence angles or 
FRAP positions. For FRAP, caps were selected 10-20 min after release from G1 
arrest. Acquisition was controlled by the Live Acquisition software. </p>

routines were implemented. Intensities in the bleached region were corrected for 
background fluorescence and total cellular fluorescence. The recovery curve was 
fitted with a double exponential function y fit (t) ¼ a(1-b(exp(-tc))-d(exp(-te)). The 
fast component corresponded to diffusion of soluble Cdc42 in the cytosol and the 
slower component ro recovery of membrane-bound Cdc42 pool via a combination 
of GDI-and actin-mediated mechanisms. The halftime for the slower component, 
t 2 
1/2 ¼ À log(0.5)/e was used for further comparison. Time stamps were auto-
matically extracted from the metadata. Data points were only used if reliable fits 
could be generated (residual sum of squares 40.95). Means and s.e.m. were 
calculated from 410 independent experiments (Supplementary Table S3). </p>

<p>The period prevalence was defined as the proportion 
of the population in the country dispensed ≥1 prescrip-
tion in 2010 and measured by the number of patients 
exposed per 1000 inhabitants (PAT/TIN). Incidence was 
defined as the proportion of the population having at 
least one prescription dispensed in a pharmacy in 2010 
after a 1-year wash-out period with no drug dispensed 
and was measured by the number of patients per 1000 
person-years (PAT/1000 PYs). 
Pharmacological groups were selected by using the fol-
lowing procedure: 
1. All 89 Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) 
second level groups with drugs available on the 
Swedish market 
17 18 were identified. 
2. In large ATC groups and ATC groups with drugs used 
for multiple heterogeneous indications, that is, 
cardiac therapy (C01), agents acting on the renin-
angiotensin system (C09), sex hormones (G03), uro-
logicals (G04), analgesics (N02), psycholeptics 
(N05), psychoanaleptics (N06), ophthalmologicals 
(S01), a subdivision was done to the ATC third or 
fourth level to attain a more clinically relevant 
description of the utilisation. 
3. ATC groups with less than 75% of the total sales 
volume in the country purchased on prescription 
were excluded since sex distribution was not possible 
to collect for those purchased over-the-counter or 
used in inpatient care. Volume was measured in the 
technical unit numbers of Defined Daily Doses 
(DDDs), except for eight pharmacological groups 
for which there were no DDDs assigned. 
18 For these 
groups, packages were used as a volume measure. 
Calculations of the proportion of the total volume 
dispensed as prescriptions in ambulatory care were 
based on aggregated volume data from all Swedish 
pharmacies. 
4. For the identified ATC groups at various hierarchical 
levels, groups that were dispensed to less than 1% of 
the total Swedish population or to less than 0.4% of 
men or women, respectively, were excluded to avoid 
random variation due to small numbers. 
Crude and age-adjusted values were calculated. Age 
standardisation was performed by direct standardisation, 
where the Swedish population on 31 December 2009 
(4 649 014 men and 4 691 668 women 
19 ) was used as the 
standard population. In the calculations, 5-year age 
groups were used. Differences between the sexes were 
calculated as a risk ratio (RR) of women/men with 95% 
CI. All analyses were performed in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Microsoft Excel</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">2007</rs>

each task with minimal noise and best signal accuracy. The 
selected file was saved as a binary file in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> for further 
analysis. 
The tasks were divided into different phases. In Dachi 
three phases of movement were determined which is dis-
cussed in another article. The phases correspond to the be-
ginning of the movement, maximum flexion and return to </p>

<p>Data was analyzed using the statistical software pack-
age <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 14</rs>). To compare variables with nor-

<p>In the Irish study the effect of open and close kinetic 
chain exercises on VL to VMO activity was compared and it 
was demonstrated that lounge and squatting are effective 
in strengthening of VMO (35). As lounge is similar to dachi 
in karate, their results are consistent with our study. 
According to Collado's study if there is no significant 
impairment in physical examination, the most important 
cause of anterior knee pain is overuse (1).This is a common 
phenomenon at national athletes who experience high vol-
ume of training. 
Comparing two groups with and without increase in 
VAS Score, no difference was observed before and after six 
weeks of training in different phases of dachi. This in-
consistent response might be due to short time follow up 
in our study. Previous studies showed that closed kinetic 
exercises improve sport performance and strength better 
than open kinetic knee exercises but open kinetic chain ex-
ercises could be applicable and effective in anterior knee 
pain rehabilitation. However, regarding the sample size, 
the clinical interpretation of the results should be done 
cautiously. 
Hodges et al. found out that by inducing pain in the 
infrapatellar fat pad, muscle activity of VL decreased sig-
nificantly during stair-up test (27). However in our study 
the decline in muscle activity was not different between 
the two with and without pain groups. However, regarding 
differences in methodology of the two studies, comparing 
deems difficult. 
There are some limitations in our study. While this 
study had a sample containing the total available popu-
lation, the sample size is still small. In order to decrease 
the effect of small sample size in future study, recruit-
ment of more subjects can be helpful. Since this study was 
conducted with a six-week interval, it is proposed to per-
form biomechanical tests with more frequency and longer 
follow-up. 
The advantages of the present study are subject pop-
ulation that is all professional athletes. The other strong 
point is the precise signal processing, evaluation of several 
functional parameters and electromyographic data analy-
sis in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> software. 
Since prospective studies in this area, especially in ath-
letes are limited, it is suggested to conduct basic and ap-
plied studies including kinematics and kinetics of specific 
movements of karate, featuring a variety of techniques of 
movement, kicks and hand strikes. Finally, long term fol-
low up study of athletes can determine the impact of the 
training camp of the national team. The main challenge 
that which training program could improve the athlete's 
performance is also worth exploring. 
The results showed that after a six-week training pe-
riod for performing the same task, less muscle activity was </p>

<p>Data extraction 
Standardised extraction forms will be developed to 
record the following information: study characteristics 
(first author, publication year, study sites, number of par-
ticipants, open label/single blind/double blind, study 
duration, source of financial support), patient's character-
istics (age, gender, diabetes (yes/no), wound infected 
(yes/no), TBSA, body mass index, cause of burn, dur-
ation of burn, burn depth), interventions and compari-
sons (name of experimental or control interventions, 
duration of treatment, frequency of wound changes, 
special wound care (yes/no), healthcare facilities where 
the participants receive wound dressings (primary/sec-
ondary/tertiary care)) and outcomes (definition of an 
outcome, intention-to-treat analysis (yes/no), main results 
and variables for calculating effect size). Extracted data 
will be entered into an electronic system developed with 
the <rs id="software-0" type="software">EpiData EntryClient</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.2.0.7.22</rs>). To lower the risk 
of entry error, double data entry and cross-check will be 
performed in the system. </p>

<p>value of 50% as a cut-off point. I 
2 &gt;50% indicates signifi-
cant heterogeneity in the RCTs testing one of the 
wound dressing classes. We will second test the hetero-
geneity in individual wound dressings when possible. If 
the included RCTs show clinically or statistically signifi-
cant heterogeneity, we will give a narrative review. 
Otherwise, we will proceed to a traditional meta-analysis, 
calculating the effect size of different classes of wound 
dressings compared with placebo or active controls. For 
continuous outcomes, standardised mean difference 
(SMD) will be calculated; for dichotomous outcomes, 
ORs will be computed. We will synthesise SMD or OR 
with the DerSimonian-Laird method (random-effects 
model). 
A Bayesian network meta-analysis will be performed to 
combine direct and indirect evidence. In this network 
meta-analysis, measures of relative effect sizes will be 
ORs in the dichotomous outcomes and SMDs in the 
continuous outcomes. Both ORs and SMDs will be 
reported with their 95% credible intervals (95% CI). 
The 95% CI could be elucidated as a 95% probability 
that the true OR or SMD falls in the reported range. 
The network meta-analysis will be performed with a 
random-effect model using WinBUGS <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">1.43</rs> (MRC 
Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge University, UK). Each ana-
lysis will be based on non-informative priors for calcula-
tion of effect sizes and 95% CI. We will use the surface 
under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) to rank the 
wound dressing classes. The SUCRA presented as per-
centages compare each wound dressing with an inter-
vention presumed as the best treatment without 
uncertainty, so a larger SUCRA means a more effective 
wound dressing class. Transitivity and consistency are the 
two key elements representing the credibility of a 
network meta-analysis. The assumption of transitivity is 
that the distribution of effect modifiers is not different 
in each pairwise comparison in the network. To account 
for transitivity in the network, we will assess participant's 
characteristics (infected or non-infected wounds, 
patients with or without diabetes, smoker or non-smoker, 
with or without long-term use of steroids), study designs 
(duration of follow-up and risk of bias) and interven-
tions (duration of treatment and wound dressings given 
in primary or secondary or tertiary care). Consistency 
between direct and indirect comparisons will be 
assessed. The result of direct comparisons will be 
acquired through the aforementioned traditional 
meta-analysis, whereas the result of indirect comparisons 
will be obtained through excluding those studies with </p>

The identification results were obtained from Mascot. 
The criteria used for protein quantitation were as follows: two 
unique peptide hits, two quantitative peptides, and disabling 
of outlier removal. The reporter ion ratio for each identified 
peptide was determined by <rs type="software">Mascot</rs>. The loess and global 
median normalization were used to process the proteom-
ics data. Data were log 2 transformed and analyzed on both 
peptide and protein level. Statistical significance of observed 
fold-change ratios was determined by one sample t-test. 
P-values ,0.05 were considered statistically significant for 
proteins. Fold change higher than 1.0 is for upregulation or 
lower than 1.0 is for downregulation. </p>

<p>In the previous study, we detected 49 and 30 metabolites 
regulated in the COPD model (versus control) and BJF-
treated (versus COPD model) groups, respectively. 
13 These 
metabolites were primarily involved in lipid metabolism 
(Figure 3A and B). In this study, a number of genes and 
proteins were identified, which deserve further attention to 
their system functions. Therefore, we further explored the 
system biological interpretation of the genes, proteins, and 
metabolites by integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics data. 
Using the <rs type="software">Metscape</rs> software, we investigated the latent 
relationships of the metabolite, gene, and protein measure-
ments by constructing the correlation network diagram. 
As shown in Figure 4A and B, according to the transcriptom-
ics and metabolomics data of COPD rats and BJF-treated rats, 
we constructed two gene-metabolite networks, which were 
mainly related to lipid metabolism and purine metabolism. 
Interestingly, a number of genes and most of the metabo-
lites were involved in lipid metabolism. Subsequently, we 
constructed two protein-metabolite networks based on the 
metabolomics and proteomics data of COPD rats and BJF-
treated rats. As shown in Figure 4C and D, we observed that 
the protein-metabolite networks could be divided into two 
primary groups: lipid metabolism and purine metabolism, 
and more than half of proteins and almost all of metabolites 
were involved in lipid metabolism. </p>

was applied to evaluate reproducibility. Two reproducibility 
tests were performed. The first one compares RSCV value at R 
¼ 2.8 mm and R ¼ 3.0 mm. The second test compares results 
graded independently by two of the authors (OT and LL). All 
image processes and statistical analyses were done using 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">Matlab</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Mathworks</rs>, Natick, MA, USA). </p>

<p>Data were analyzed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 20.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM Corporation</rs>, Armonk, 
NY, USA). Categorical variables were first summarized as 
absolute and relative frequencies, while continuous variables 
were described as mean values and standard deviations 
(n=70). The association between exposure and outcome 
variables (a diagnosis of sarcopenia according to EWGSOP 
and Baumgartner criteria) was evaluated using chi-square or 
Fisher's exact test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
were also calculated. Exposure variables were categorized at 
the median, in the case of height and weight, or as described 
in the previous section. 
The distribution of quality-of-life scores was analyzed 
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method. Nonparametric 
Friedman tests were then used to investigate the associa-
tion between quality of life and a diagnosis of sarcopenia 
according to Baumgartner and EWGSOP criteria. Once the 
normality of each variable had been tested, Mann-Whitney 
U-tests were used to analyze nonparametric variables, while 
Student's t-tests for independent samples were used to com-
pare the mean value of parametric variables between subjects 
with and without sarcopenia. Results were considered sig-
nificant at P#0.05. </p>

<p>The signal intensity of lacritin bands was determined by 
multiplying the area of the band with the average pixel 
intensity to provide volume-sum intensity for each band. The 
signal intensity of the 12-to 15-kDa, 25-kDa, and 40-kDa bands 
from each individual's tear sample was quantified using <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageJ</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">(http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</rs>: provided in the public domain by the 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD, USA). The signal 
intensity value of each band was expressed as area pixel 
density. Data were expressed as the relative percentage of 
lacritin species by dividing the signal intensity of each lacritin 
species (i.e., lacritin cleaved fragment [15 kDa], lacritin 
monomer [26 kDa], or inactive lacritin polymers &gt;40 kDa) 
by the total signal intensity of all lacritin species. </p>

to identify patients with the ocular component of SS was 
assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using 
the <rs id="software-2" type="software">RStudio</rs> platform (Boston, MA, USA), <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 0.98.1102</rs>. 
Area under the curve (AUC) was estimated by R package pROC 
to determine the 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). 
20 The ROC 
cutoff for each of these variables was optimized to maximize the 
sensitivity and specificity. The optimized performances were 
compared to the performance of clinical tests and associated 
cutoffs currently used to diagnose the signs and symptoms of SS-
associated dry eye, including Schirmer score 5, OSS  ‡ 3, OSDI 
 ‡ 20, and TBUT &lt; 10 seconds. The mean values and 95% 
confidence intervals of sensitivity and specificity for each 
clinical test were calculated from 2000 bootstrap runs using 
the R package Boot. 21 </p>

<p>To investigate the value of quantitative analysis in dual energy spectral computed tomography (DESCT) for differentiating malignant 
gastric mucosal lesions from benign gastric mucosal lesions (including gastric inflammation [GI] and normal gastric mucosa [NGM]). 
This study was approved by the ethics committee, and all patients provided written informed consent. A total of 161 consecutive 
patients (63 with gastric cancer [GC], 48 with GI, and 50 with NGM) who underwent dual-phase contrast enhanced DESCT scans in 
the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PVP) were included in this study. Iodine concentration (IC) in lesions was derived from 
the iodine-based material-decomposition images and normalized to that in the aorta to obtain normalized IC (nIC). The ratios of IC 
and nIC between the AP and PVP were calculated. Diagnostic confidence for GC and GI was evaluated with reviewing the features 
including gastric wall thickness, focal, and eccentric on the conventional polychromatic images. All statistical analyses were 
performed by using statistical software <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">17.0</rs> (SPSS, Chicago, IL). IC and nIC in GC differed significantly from those in GI and 
NGM, except for nIC AP in comparing GC with GI. Mean nIC values of GC (0.18 ± 0.06 in AP and 0.62 ± 0.16 in PVP) were significantly 
higher than that of NGM (0.12 ± 0.03 in AP and 0.37 ± 0.08 in PVP) (all P &lt; 0.05). There was also significant difference for IC values in 
GC, GI, and NGM (24.19 ± 8.27, 19.07 ± 5.82, and 13.61 ± 2.52 mg/mL, respectively, in AP and 28.00 ± 7.01, 24.66 ± 6.55, and 
16.94 ± 3.06 mg/mL, respectively, in PVP). Based on Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve analysis, nIC and IC in PVP had high 
sensitivities of 88.89% and 90.48%, respectively, in differentiating GC from NGM, while the sensitivities were 71.43% and 88.89% 
during AP. Ratios IC and nIC ratios did not provide adequate diagnostic accuracy with their area under curves less than 0.65. With the 
conventional features, the diagnostic accuracies for GC and GI were 75.0% and 98.0%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of DESCT 
imaging parameters for gastric mucosa, such as nIC and IC, is useful for differentiating malignant from benign gastric mucosal lesions. </p>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">17.0</rs> (SPSS, 
Chicago, IL) statistical software for Windows. All quantitative 
data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The one-way 
analysis of variance test with post hoc Bonferroni correction was 
performed to compare the parameters IC, nIC, IC ratio, and nIC 
ratio between GC and GI, GC and NGM, and GI and NGM both 
in AP and PVP, with P &lt; 0.05 indicating statistical significance. 
Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was 
performed to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of IC, nIC, IC 
ratio, and nIC ratio and to establish the optimal threshold values 
to discriminating GC from NGM and GI. Area under curve 
(AUC) for the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff value 
were calculated. The null hypothesis tested was that the AUC was 
0.5, and the alternative was that the AUC was greater than 0.5. 
Diagnostic accuracy was analyzed with the diagnostic 
confidence and the clinical results (including pathological and 
endoscopic results). The interobserver agreement for the gastric </p>

<p>The one-against-all on SCOP90 function is designed to find

PDB weekly) (24) with a specified chain (PDB ID option), 
or a structure in PDB format uploaded by user (User's struc-
ture option). All of the three inputs can be accompanied with 
optional parameter settings for customized output. The 
parameters that could be changed from default include mini-
mum rough Z-score [for the alignment prior to refinement 
(21)], minimum refined Z-score, maximum root mean square 
deviation (RMSD) of Ca superposition between two aligned 
protein chains, minimum aligned sequence identity, maxi-
mum number of shown matches, and sorting options (right 
panel in Figure 1b and user guide 3.1.2). Unlike the first 
input option, for which pre-computed results will be 
retrieved, the last two input options require entry of user's 
e-mail address (user guide 3.1.3) because the OPAAS server 
needs time for computation and will return the result via 
email in, typically, minutes to hours, depending mainly on 
the stringency of the selected parameters. 
For the first input option, a table of matched results 
retrieved from a pre-computed database will be displayed 
directly on the web page (Figure 1c and user guide 3.2). In 
this table, Z-score, #a.a. aligned (number of aligned amino

as described above. User can sort the table by the field 
selected (user guide 3.2.2) and download this table either as

<p>All samples were extensively dialysed into fresh buffer [50 mM 
Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mM TCEP and 100 mM NaCl (CoZi) or 
150 mM NaCl (NEMO 355 )]. Protein concentration was determined 
by UV absorbance and confirmed by the integration of RI 
peaks from SEC-MALS (see below). ITC measurements were 
carried out at 10 
• C, 18

• C on a VP-ITC or ITC200 
MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal Inc). In most cases, ITC titrations 
were carried out with 29 consecutive 10 μl injections of ubiquitin 
into the cell containing NEMO on the VP-ITC or alternatively 
with 19 consecutive 2 μl injections on the ITC200 instrument (all 
at various concentrations). ITC data were analysed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Origin7</rs>

records could feasibly be obtained going back to 1997, 
hence the decision to cover awards during 1997-2010. 
We assigned each study to primary disease categories, 
and within each category we documented topic-specific 
subsections, including specific pathogen or disease. We 
allocated studies to one of four categories along the 
R&amp;D continuum: preclinical; phases I, II or III; product 
development; and operational research, and to 1 of the 
26 categories for funding organisations. 
Where the PI was named, we assigned them to men or 
women categories. The studies where only an initial was 
available for the forename were assigned as 'unclear' if 
we were unable to establish the PI's gender from a 
review of the literature, institutional websites or publicly 
available publications and documents. 
Reference to sexually transmitted infections excludes 
HIV. Neglected tropical diseases were categorised accord-
ing to the classification used by the WHO (http://www. 
who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en). Antimicrobial 
resistance includes antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and 
antiparasitic studies. 
We converted grants awarded in a currency other than 
pounds sterling to UK pounds using the mean exchange 
rate in the year of the award. We adjusted grant funding 
amounts for inflation and reported in 2010 UK pounds. 
As well as excluding studies not immediately relevant 
to infection, we excluded unfunded studies, veterinary 
infectious disease research studies (unless there was a 
zoonotic component), those exploring the use of viral 
vectors to investigate non-communicable diseases, grants 
for symposia or meetings or studies with UK contribu-
tions (eg, as a collaborator), but the funding was 
awarded to a non-UK institution. 
We used <rs id="software-0" type="software">Microsoft Excel</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">versions 2000</rs> and 2007 to 
categorise studies. Where needed, data were exported 
into <rs id="software-2" type="software">Microsoft Access</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">versions 2000</rs> and 2007) and spe-
cific keyword queries used to select precise sections of 
the data for analysis. We used <rs id="software-4" type="software">Stata</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">V.11.0</rs>) for statistical 
analysis and to generate figures. 
We used fold differences to compare total investment, 
number of studies, mean grant and median grant 
between men and women according to disease system, 
specific infection and funding organisation. 
We used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney rank-sum 
test to assess the distribution of funding by gender. 
The non-parametric K-sample test on equality of 
medians was applied to compare the median funding 
by gender, and reported as a χ 
2 statistic without 
Yates' correction for continuity. The non-parametric 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied when comparing 
matched data, such as time trends by gender. The sig-
nificance for all tests was defined at the 5% level (two-
sided p=0.05). 
We present differences between gender and do 
not attempt to investigate or imply bias or inequalities as 
we could not access data on unsuccessful grant 
applications. </p>

<p>In the majority of cases, individual env variant's IC 50 s was a mean of 
3 independent assays. Comparisons within an individual were done 
using Wilcoxon rank sum test. For comparisons across multiple individ-

termined for each subject. Inter-subject comparison were done using 
Kruskal Wallis test, and pair-wise inter-subject comparisons were 
done using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The matched pairs Wilcoxon 
rank sum test was used when all individuals had variants with the co-

<p>A glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is a common but complex C-terminal 
post-translational modif ication of extracellular proteins in eukaryotes. Here we 
investigate the problem of correctly annotating GPI-anchored proteins for the 
growing number of sequences in public databases. We developed a computa-
tional system, called <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs>, based on the tandem use of a neural net-
work (NN) and a hidden Markov model (HMM). Firstly, NN selects potential 
GPI-anchored proteins in a dataset, then HMM parses these potential GPI sig-
nals and ref ines the prediction by qualitative scoring. <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> correctly pre-
dicted 91% of all the GPI-anchored proteins annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. 
In a large-scale analysis of 29 eukaryote proteomes, <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> predicted that 
the percentage of highly probable GPI-anchored proteins is between 0.21% and 
2.01%. The distinctive feature of <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs>, compared with other systems, 
is that it targets only the C-terminus of a protein, making it less sensitive to 
the background noise found in databases and possible incomplete protein se-
quences. Moreover, <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> can be used to predict GPI-anchored proteins 
in all eukaryotes. Finally, by using qualitative scoring, the predictions combine 
both sensitivity and information content. The predictor is publicly available at 
http://navet.ics.hawaii.edu/∼fraganchor/NNHMM/NNHMM.html. </p>

<p>anchored proteins, but there are many exceptions that 
newly identified GPI-anchored proteins depart from 
these rules (for example, unpredictable N-terminal 
signals, C-terminal signals with overlapping spacer re-
gion and hydrophobic tail, or length of the spacer re-
gion outside the parameters), lowering automatically 
the sensitivity of the predictions based on methods 
using such rules in a strict way. 
Currently, there exist three different predictors 
publicly available: <rs id="software-11" type="software">big-π</rs> (15 ) from the <rs corresp="#software-11" type="creator">University of Vienna</rs> (available in two versions, one for meta-
zoa and one for protozoa), <rs id="software-12" type="software">DGPI</rs> from the <rs corresp="#software-12" type="creator">University of Geneva</rs> (retrieved from <rs corresp="#software-12" type="url">http://129.194.185.165/dgpi</rs>/), and the large-scale annotator GPI-SOM (16 ) 
from the University of Bern. The first two also pre-
dict potential cleavage sites while the third does not. 
These tools target the C-terminal and N-terminal sig-
nals of protein sequences, or require verifying the pres-
ence of the N-terminal signal before submitting se-
quences to the predictor. This affects automatically 
their performance in the presence of fragmented or 
partial sequences, which happen to be more and more 
common in databases. In particular, metagenome 
projects generate many fragmented sequences repre-
senting only partial proteins, complicating the anno-
tation process. Moreover, with metagenome projects, 
the inability to relate many of the new sequences to 
a specific taxonomic group does not favor the use of 
a group-specific tool like <rs type="software">big-π</rs>. Therefore, large-scale 
annotation tools, which are able to predict the pres-
ence of a particular motif at different levels of preci-
sion (that is, to assess each prediction in a qualitative 
way) with minimal information, are then needed to 
address this new reality, since tools that are too re-
strictive or specialized often lack the flexibility needed 
to make correct predictions. For example, a recent 
analysis of the P. falciparum proteome shows that 
<rs type="software">big-π</rs>, <rs type="software">DGPI</rs>, and <rs type="software">GPI-SOM</rs> generated poor results in 
predicting proteins selected as biologically validated 
or highly probable candidates (14 ). Accordingly, our 
system was designed to offer the precision of cleavage 
site prediction tools and the flexibility needed for a 
large-scale annotator in a noisy environment. </p>

<p>We developed a system, called <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs>, based on 
the tandem use of a neural network (NN) and a hid-
den Markov model (HMM). NN is used to select po-
tential GPI-anchored sequences and HMM classifies </p>

<p>curated database are based on automated prediction. 
In the test performed with 30 sequences of those 
proposed by Gilson et al (14 ) from the P. falciparum 
proteome, <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> was able to predict 29 of them 
as GPI-anchored protein sequences (96.67%). How-
ever, it is interesting to note that 40% of these predic-
tions were classified as potential false positive (Class 
4). 
The tests with the two negative sets gave very 
good results as 96.80% and 93.79% of the sequences 
were rejected by NN, respectively, while HMM clas-
sified most of the incorrectly selected sequences as po-
tential false positives. These examples illustrate the 
importance and usefulness of the qualitative scoring 
of the predictions of <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs>. 
The sequences of the four test sets described above 
were also submitted to two publicly available predic-
tors of GPI-anchored proteins: <rs type="software">big-π</rs> (15 ) and <rs type="software">GPI-
SOM</rs> (16 ) (Table 3). We did not compare <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> 
with <rs type="software">DGPI</rs> because the design of this tool makes large 
dataset analysis difficult. Since <rs type="software">big-π</rs> and <rs type="software">GPI-SOM</rs> 
require the use of <rs type="software">SignalP</rs> (18 ) for the N-terminal sig-
nal peptide prediction, we included an evaluation of 
<rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> combined with <rs type="software">SignalP</rs> to help the com-
parison process. However, the use of <rs type="software">SignalP</rs> is not re-
quired before using <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs>. Compared with big-</p>

<p>π, FragAnchor is more sensitive to the GPI-anchoring 
pattern even if we consider only the first three classes 
(highly probable, probable, and weakly probable). 
For the first set of 121 GPI-anchored sequences, Fra-
gAnchor correctly predicted 88.43% of them (82.64% 
in Classes 1-3) while big-π accepted 60.33%. For the 
newly analyzed P. falciparum sequences, as pointed 
out in Gilson et al (14 ), most predictors failed to pre-
dict a significant number of sequences known to bear 
GPI anchor. In Table 3, we can see that FragAn-
chor has a very high capacity of prediction with only 
one sequence wrongly predicted. Even when discard-
ing the potential false positive sequences, <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> 
recognizes more GPI-anchored sequences than <rs type="software">big-π</rs> 
does. One of the reasons of the better performance 
of <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> is the fact that it does not need the 
presence of the N-terminal signal, which is not clearly 
detectable in 6 of the 30 P. falciparum sequences. 
On the other hand, <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> shows a lower ca-
pacity of discrimination for the negative sets when 
compared with <rs type="software">big-π</rs>, which is understandable due to 
the high stringency of <rs type="software">big-π</rs>. However, this high strin-
gency is accompanied by a poor capacity of prediction 
for the GPI anchor signal. Nonetheless, we achieved a 
specificity of <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> comparable to that of <rs type="software">GPI-
SOM</rs> and <rs type="software">big-π</rs>. The specificity was computed by 
adding the proportions of the first three classes (Ta-
ble 2), for example, for the cytoplasm and nuclear 
proteins, it is 0.21 + 0.16 + 0.27 = 0.64. For the mem-
brane transport proteins, FragAnchor gave more false 
positive predictions. However, for this set of proteins, 
it is possible that some of them will eventually be 
validated as real GPI-anchored proteins in laboratory 
experiments. 
When compared with <rs type="software">GPI-SOM</rs>, <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> is 
more accurate. <rs type="software">GPI-SOM</rs> predicted fewer GPI-
anchored sequences from the first positive set of 121 
sequences, with a prediction rate of 82.64% compared 
with 88.43% for <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs>. It also failed to predict 
a significant number of the P. falciparum sequences 
with only 73.33% of correctly predicted GPI-anchored 
sequences. For the negative sets, the use of FragAn-
chor combined with <rs type="software">SignalP</rs> showed that <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> 
achieved results close to <rs type="software">GPI-SOM</rs> (better for the first 
negative set, slightly lower for the second negative 
set). 
More interestingly, the analysis of P. falciparum 
GPI-anchored sequences showed that a large portion 
of the GPI-anchored sequences (40%) fell in the po-
tential false positive prediction, proving the useful-
ness of keeping those potentially wrongly predicted </p>

<p>sequences in a specific class. An analysis of the se-
quences rejected by <rs type="software">GPI-SOM</rs> showed that 50% of 
them were found in the potential false positive class 
from <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs>. In addition, the analysis result of 
P. falciparum sequences demonstrated that 4 of the 11 
biochemically validated GPI-anchored sequences did 
not have an N-terminal signal peptide recognized by 
<rs type="software">SignalP</rs>. This fact confirms the effectiveness of an an-
notation not based on the prediction of this signal. In 
short, the comparison with other tools is not easy due 
to the uniqueness of the tandem method. However, 
it reveals an interesting power of prediction where, in 
a single run, <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> can have a very low num-
ber of potential false positive predictions with a much 
higher number of GPI-anchored sequences predicted. 
In Figure 2, we show an example of output from 
the tandem system (<rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> predictor). NN first 
selects a protein sequence and then HMM parses 
the sequence in order to predict a potential cleavage 
site. The first predicted anchor site for that sequence 
(5NTD HUMAN) is at position 549. This is the po-
sition annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. In the 
output, the predictor proposes a maximum of three 
possible anchor sites, ranked by decreasing scores. 
We selected 29 eukaryote proteomes available from 
the EBI Intergr8 portal (19 ) for large-scale analysis. 
The results showed that, in general, the percentage 
of GPI-anchored proteins in a proteome is between 
0.21% and 2.01% when only the highly probable class 
is considered (Table 4). These results are compa-
rable with a study performed by Eisenhaber et al 
(20 ) that estimated the proportion of the Arabidop-
sis thaliana proteome consisting of GPI-anchored pro-
teins at 0.75%. </p>

<p>The comparison of <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> with <rs type="software">big-π</rs> and <rs type="software">GPI-
SOM</rs> shows that <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> can be used at different 
levels of precision, allowing a more selective predic-
tion. In addition, it offers a high level of flexibility 
with respect to the organism considered. Studies like 
the P. falciparum proteome analysis by Gilson et al 
(14 ), where the available predictors failed to predict 
the biochemically proposed new GPI-anchored pro-
teins, show that there is a need for a more flexible 
and universal predictor. The flexibility and accuracy 
achieved by <rs type="software">FragAnchor</rs> offer an excellent annotator

<p>ments are artificial neurons that: (1) accept numer-
ical input from other neurons or from the external 
environment; (2) process their input with a transfer 
function; (3) output a value to other neurons or back 
to the external environment. 
The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator 
(<rs id="software-64" type="software">javaNNS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-64" type="version-number">1.1</rs>) developed at the University of 
Stuttgart (<rs corresp="#software-64" type="url">http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/downloads/JavaNNS</rs>/) was used to design and 
train our NN predictor. The learning set for this 
experiment is 79 sequences from the Swiss-Prot 
database release 49.0 that are annotated as GPI-
anchored proteins, with a length of the C-terminal 
section to be 50 a.a., and another 79 sequences of pro-
teins that are known not to be GPI-anchored proteins. 
The choice of the length of the C-terminal section was 
based on an analysis of Swiss-Prot GPI-anchored pro-
teins, which showed a maximum length of 45 a.a. for 
the C-terminal signal. To give some flexibility to the 
system, we selected an input vector of 50 a.a. Since 
neural networks accept numerical input, and given the 
importance of molecular weight and hydrophobicity </p>

cRNA targets were hybridized on high-density oligonucleotide gene 
chips (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 and GeneChip Rat 
Genome 230 2.0 Arrays) according to the Affymetrix Eukaryotic Target 
Hybridization manual. The gene chips were washed and stained using 
the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and <rs type="software">Genechip Operating Software</rs> 
and scanned by means of an Affymetrix GeneArray scanner. </p>

<p>3.6.4. Functional annotation 
To understand the biological meaning behind the list of DE genes, 
Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG) pathways 
analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) from DAVID website (The Database 
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) v 6.7 (http:// 
david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) were used. Only GO and pathways with P-
value b 0.05 (Benjamin-Hochberg corrected) and with 5 or more 
genes were analyzed and discussed. In addition, <rs type="software">Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis</rs> (IPA) was used. Only pathways and functions with P b 0.05 
(Fisher's exact test right-tailed) were analyzed and discussed. </p>

<p>It is typically assumed that also innovations are normally distributed with zero mean 
and a given variance Q. State space models can also be formulated much more 
generally than this specification. For example, the system matrices A and B could 
depend explicitly on time, or one could introduce policy variables and constants in the 
specification. However, our model will be characterized by a simple formulation where 
state variables follow a random walk model, i.e. B is an identity matrix. 
Generally, in practical applications the system matrices A and B together with the 
variances R and Q are unknown and have to be estimated. Whenever the explanatory 
variables are not observable Least Squares estimation is not the correct way to go. 
However, even in this case, one can apply likelihood based inference, since the Kalman 
filter allows to construct the likelihood function associated with a state space model. 
The SSM is therefore estimated by maximizing the estimated likelihood function 
through a numerical procedure. We apply this procedure by using the <rs type="software">Sspace</rs> package 
in the <rs type="software">EViews</rs>® software. 
Our first step is to obtain consistent estimations of real estate demand and supply 
functions for China. To do this, we select a number of macroeconomic variables for 
each function. We verify their stationarity properties and co-integration. We opt to only 
include co-integrated variables in each function, even if in principle a SSM can handle 
variables that are not co-integrated. By doing this, we do not have to impose any 
structure on the functions and we can still obtain consistent estimations. In particular, 
we model that all macro variables evolve as a random walk, so that no stationarity in 
the estimated demand and supply is superimposed by the modelling assumptions. 
After finding consistent estimations for demand and supply, we move to the second 
step of our analysis. We interpret that estimated demand and supply represent the 
fundamental forces beyond price movements and we estimate the unobserved funda-
mental price that would equate demand and supply through a new SSM iteration, by 
modelling the unobserved fundamental price as a random walk. As for the other 
macroeconomic variables, modelling a random walk process for the fundamental price 
is a natural choice because we do not want to impose any structure that could influence 
the fundamental price beyond the estimated factors. Finally, we compare the estimated 
fundamental price with the observed price, we compute their deviation ratio and 
analyse its properties. 
Compared to other approaches in the literature reviewed in section 3, the novel 
contribution of our methodology is that the deviation ratio measures a purely irrational 
bubble component. In other words, our bubble component does not include price 
changes that are due to non-equilibrium between supply and demand, where demand 
includes not only the users' market but also investors' demand. This feature is 
important because real estate markets can be characterized by a fundamental mismatch 
between supply and demand which can take time to correct and by a component of 
demand that is investment driven and that is typically not decreasing in price.

<p>As it is often the case with this type of macro variables, evaluating the data with 
Augment Dickey-Fuller test reveals that these variables are non-stationary in levels, but 
become stationary in first differences. We also adjust for seasonality with the <rs type="software">Eviews</rs> 
Census X12 method and take the log of all variables to correct for heteroscedasticity. 
SS is our measure for real estate demand and FS is our measure for real estate supply. 
We carry out Johansen tests to select co-integrated variables for demand and supply. 
After that we estimate the two functions by a SSM. </p>

<p>
The residuals of the above five equations are assumed to have independent and 
identical distributions. Equations (3) and (4) form a SSM are estimated by Kalman filter 
using the Sspace analysis tools in <rs type="software">Eviews</rs>7.0®. The estimated coefficients represent the 
long term and stable elasticity of sold real estate space with respect to each variables. 
Results are reported in Table 2 below. 
We notice from Table 2 that the coefficient DV1 is positive and significant, this 
implies that demand for real estate increases in price. This apparently unusual 
positive relation of prices on demand is not uncommon in markets characterized 
by a strong investment, or speculation, motive. We notice that the coefficient DV2 
is not significant and is excluded from the demand equation in the following steps 
of our analysis. Coefficients DV3 and DV4 are significant and they show a 
positive effect of interest rates and a negative effect of inflation. Similarly to what 
happens with the coefficient of price, the positive coefficient of interest rates, 
apparently a non-standard result, is due to the fact that Chinese national govern-
ment policies have systematically raised interest rates in periods of strong demand 
as discussed in section 6. The negative coefficient of inflation is as expected and 
due to household budget constraints (Table 3). </p>

<p>In this case, eqs. (5) and (6) form a SSM are estimated by Kalman filter using the 
Sspace analysis tools in <rs type="software">Eviews</rs>7.0®. The estimated coefficients represent the long term 
and stable elasticity of completed real estate space with respect to each variable. Results 
are reported in Table 4 below. 
We notice from Table 4 that all coefficients are significant. SV1 is positive 
and this implies that demand for real estate increases in price as expected. We 
notice that the coefficient SV2 is positive implying that money supply increases 
real estate supply. Coefficients SV3 and SV4 show a negative effect of interest 
rates and a positive effect of GDP. The positive effect of money supply and the 
negative effect of interest rates are due to the fact that national policies have 
systematically used money supply and base interest rate to stimulate or alter-
natively curb real estate development activity. The positive effect of GDP on 
real estate supply is standard. </p>

<p>Summary: Alternative Splicing Effects ASsessment Tools (AS-EAST) 
is an online tool for the functional annotation of putative proteins 
encoded by transcripts generated by alternative splicing (AS). When 
provided with a transcript sequence, AS-EAST identifies regions 
altered by AS events in the putative protein sequence encoded by the 
transcript. Users can evaluate the predicted function of the putative 
protein by inspecting whether functional domains are included in the 
altered regions. Moreover, users can infer the loss of inter-molecular 
interactions in the protein network according to whether the AS 
events affect interaction residues observed in the 3D structure of 
the reference isoform. The information obtained from AS-EAST will 
help to design experimental analyses for the functional significance 
of novel splice isoforms. 
Availability: The online tool is freely available at http://as-alps. 
In higher eukaryotes, genes often produce alternatively spliced 
transcripts (AS transcripts). Many AS events have been actively 
detected with high-throughput experimental methods, such as 
RNA-Seq and microarrays (Hallegger et al., 2010). However, the 
functions of putative proteins encoded by AS transcripts (termed 
'AS isoforms') have not been experimentally analyzed in many 
cases. Functional annotation tools for transcripts with novel patterns 
of splicing are desirable to infer the functional significance of AS 
isoforms. There are few tools for analyzing AS isoforms translated 
from novel transcripts queried by users. <rs id="software-4" type="software">AltAnalyze</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">http://www. altanalyze.org</rs>) identifies AS events using RNA-Seq or microarray 
data and shows how these events may affect domain composition. 
However, it does not provide information on the effects of AS on 
the 3D structures of AS isoforms. MAISTAS (Floris et al., 2011) 
assesses whether user-queried AS isoforms are structurally plausible 
proteins, but explicit functional annotations are not provided. 
Previously, we developed a pipeline that detects regions altered 
by AS events (termed 'AS regions') in AS isoforms using genome 
sequences and full-length transcript data (Yura et al., 2006). 
The pipeline then evaluates the impact of AS events on the </p>

<p>First, a genome contig sequence aligned to the query transcript 
sequence with the largest value of both length coverage and sequence 
identity is selected using MEGABLAST (Altschul et al., 1997). 
An alignment of the query transcript and the contig sequence 
is performed using SPLIGN (Kapustin et al., 2008). AS-EAST 
searches the AS-ALPS database for transcripts mapped on the 
same region of the contig as the query transcript. The user can 
select one of the transcripts as a reference transcript. Second, the 
protein-coding sequence (CDS) of the query transcript is predicted 
by identifying the longest open reading frame (ORF) or <rs id="software-5" type="software">FrameDP 
program</rs> (Gouzy et al., <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-date">2009</rs>). Users can also use the ORF starting </p>

of exon-skipped transcript sequence generation, the mapping results of RNA-
Seq data from Wang et al. (2008) are shown at the top of the schematic 
figure in the human dataset. Mapping of the RNA-Seq data was performed 
using the <rs id="software-8" type="software">TopHat</rs> program (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Trapnell et al.</rs>., <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-date">2009</rs>) with default parameters. 
(b) Interaction residues obtained from 3D structure information assigned to 
a reference isoform. The deletion-type AS region is shown in red. Interaction 
residues are denoted with arrowheads in the schematic view and stick models 
in the 3D structure view. The ligand is shown in a space-filling model. The 
3D structure is shown with <rs id="software-9" type="software">Jmol</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="url">http://www.jmol.org</rs>/) </p>

<p>To analyze the functional effect of AS on a putative protein encoded 
by the query transcript (query isoform), annotations of the query 
isoform with functional regions are performed using <rs id="software-6" type="software">InterProScan</rs> 
(Zdobnov and Apweiler, <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-date">2001</rs>). From the results of <rs type="software">InterProScan</rs>, 
functional domains from the Pfam, Gene3D and SUPERFAMILY 
databases and transmembrane regions predicted with TMHMM 
are shown in AS-EAST. Moreover, AS-EAST annotates the query 
isoform using functional amino acid residue information (Fig. 1b). 
Amino acid residues interacting with other molecules (interaction 
residues) are identified from the 3D structure data of protein 
complexes (Yura et al., 2006). AS-EAST assigns 3D structures to 
the query isoform with BLASTP (Altschul et al., 1997). AS-EAST 
determines whether 3D structures are assigned to AS regions on 
the basis of the criteria by Yura et al. (2006). According to the 
alignment of the sequences of the reference isoform and the assigned 
3D structures, interaction residues are projected to the corresponding 
residues in the AS regions. In the MAPK1 example, the query 
isoform has a protein kinase domain, according to the results of 
InterProScan. However, the query isoform lacks a region that has 
some residues constituting the ATP-binding pocket and interaction 
residues and is predicted to lose protein kinase activity. Therefore, 
the expression of the AS isoform encoded by the fourth exon-skipped 
transcript in human skeletal muscle might inhibit the MAP kinase 
signaling pathway and regulate cell proliferation/differentiation as 
a result. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. All cell proliferation assays were performed 
at least twice at different times. The repeated experiments gave 
comparable results. The comparative statistical evaluations 
between the different cell line conditions were performed by 
two-way ANOVA with treatment concentration and cell line 
condition as variables. For post hoc testing, a multiple comparative 
test with Dunn-Šidák correction was used. For RT-qPCR 
experiments, normalised relative gene expression values were 
calculated using <rs id="software-1" type="software">qBasePLUS</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 1.5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Biogazelle</rs>, </p>

to household gene expression (GAPDH and RPL13A for BON-1; 
HPRT and YWAZ for QGP-1) according to the geNorm algorithm 
(Mestdagh et al, 2009). Comparison between gene expression levels 
was done by Student's t-test and adjusted for multiple testing using 
Holm-Bonferroni correction. All statistical analyses were done 
using <rs id="software-2" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">5.0 for Windows</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">GraphPad Software</rs>,

<p>the hypothermic patients with the normothermic and 
hyperthermic patients. 
For quantitative data evaluation, the median test and 
Mann-Whitney U-test were used. To objectify if transfu-
sion and mortality were independent of the patient's 
temperature, age and GCS contingency tables were 
created and analysed with a χ 
2 test. To compare means, 
Student's t test was used. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was 
applied to identify whether hypothermic and transfused 
patients had a higher risk of mortality than the other 
patients in the study. Binary logistic regression was used 
to determine risk factors for mortality. The univariate 
predictors were the body temperature and transfusion. 
The results are given in adjusted OR (AOR) and 
reached statistical significance with p&lt;0.001. Other 
results are presented as mean (SD) for ordinal data, and 
as median for data which had expected peaks and 
descriptive data as raw percentages. Statistical analysis

are given as mean±standard error of the mean. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Data in the text and tables were expressed as the mean ± stan-
dard deviation (SD) or medians (interquartile range) for con-
tinuous variables and percentages of the number for categori-
cal variables. Participants were divided into quartiles on the ba-
sis of serum GGT level as follows: quartile 1, GGT &lt; 17 IU/L; 
quartile 2, GGT 17 to 25 IU/L; quartile 3, 25 to 40 IU/L GGT; 
and quartile 4, GGT ≥ 40 IU/L. The one-way ANOVA and chi-
square-test were used to analyze the statistical differences among 
the characteristics of the participants at the baseline visit ac-
cording to the quartile groups of serum GGT level. The distribu-
tions of continuous variables were evaluated, and log transfor-
mations were used in the analysis as required. For cases with 
incident prehypertension, the time spent at incident prehyper-
tension was assumed to be the midpoint between the baseline 
visit and the visit at which prehypertension was first diagnosed. 
The person years were calculated as the sum of follow-up times 
from the baseline until the assumed time prehypertension was 
diagnosed or until the final examination of each individual. 
Compared to the lowest quartile of serum GGT, the hazards ra-
tios (HRs) of the highest 3 quartiles of serum GGT was calculat-
ed by the Cox proportional hazard model after adjustment for 
baseline characteristics such as age, log (hsCRP), total choles-
terol, creatinine, recent smoking status, alcohol intake, regular 
exercise and diabetes mellitus. For the linear trends of risk, the 
number of quartiles was used as a continuous variable and test-
ed on each model. To use the Cox proportional hazards models, 
we checked the validity of the proportional hazards assump-
tion. Two approaches were used to assess the validity of the 
proportional hazards assumption. First, the assumption was 
assessed by log-minus-log-survival function and found to graph-
ically hold. Second, to confirm the validity of the proportional 
hazards assumption, time-dependent covariate analysis was 
used. The time-dependent covariate was not statistically signifi-
cant, suggesting that the proportional hazards assumption is 
not violated (P = 0.055). P values less than 0.05 were considered 
to be statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed

<p>Sample size calculation. Sample size was determined 
on the basis of the data from Kennedy and Scholey 
(2004). Mean change-from-baseline rapid visual infor-
mation processing accuracy scores were averaged 
across the 30-, 40-and 50-min post-treatment mea-
sures for the 40 g caffeine plus 68 g glucose and the 
placebo conditions, respectively. The resulting effect 
size (Cohen's d) of 0.372 was used to calculate the 
sample size for a four-condition analysis of variance

unless otherwise stated. 
Demographic and morphometric data were analysed 
using one-way ANOVA comparing treatments with 
pairwise comparisons where appropriate to ensure that 
the groups were matched. Blood glucose levels were 
analysed using a 2-way ANOVA examining effects of 
Treatment × Time (baseline, pre-testing, post-testing) 
with the latter as a within-subjects factor. Salivary 
caffeine was analysed using a 2-way ANOVA examining 
effects of Treatment × Time (pre-testing, post-testing) 
with the latter as a within-subjects factor. 
The primary outcome was the overall multi-tasking 
score. Secondary outcomes included scores on the 
individual tasks. Multi-tasking performance (overall 
score and individual task scores) were analysed as 
follows. Each score was computed as change from 
baseline, group outliers were removed from resulting 
scores and data were then analysed by one-way 
ANOVA comparing treatments. Group differences 
were explored by all pairwise comparisons (least 
significant difference statistic). 
Mood and stress reactivity (i.e. the changes in alert-
ness, calmness, contentedness, state anxiety, stress and 
fatigue) were computed (post-stressor minus pre-
stressor or Δ). The resulting scores were examined as 
change from baseline Δ and were analysed by one-
way ANOVA in the same way as the performance 
scores. Changes in aspects of perceived effort as mea-
sured using the NASA-TLX were analysed by one-way 
ANOVA examining effects of treatment (drink). Planned 
pairwise comparisons (least significant difference) were 
conducted to establish differences between active treat-
ments and placebo and between different active drinks. 
Treatment guessing data were analysed by chi-square

[13]. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride 
membrane (Bio-Rad) by using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-
Rad, Trans-blot SD), and blocked with 3% nonfat milk in PBS 
(1X; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM 
KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes 
were probed with anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, 
St. Louis, MO) at a 1:100 dilution, followed by incubation in 
goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to infrared 
fluorescent dye (IRD; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) 
at 1:10,000 dilution. Blots were scanned using the Odyssey 
Imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). If reprobing of a 
blot was desired, the antigen-antibody complex was stripped 
using a mild stripping solution (0.2 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, 
0.1% SDS, 0.01% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, 
followed by 3X washing with PBS-0.1% Tween-20. The 
membranes were then blocked as described and reprobed 
with anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 1:200 
dilution, followed by incubation with the secondary anti-
body as described, and scanning using the Odyssey Imaging 
system. The pixel intensity of the western blots, normalized 
to vimentin, was analyzed using <rs type="software">Image-J</rs> software [14]. The 
normalized value of siCTR was considered 100%, and the 
other values were calculated compared to the siCTR value.

<p>Human melanoma (Mel-29, -23 and -6) and breast cancer cells 
(MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) were injected s.c. in the right flank of 
5-to 6-week-old male and female athymic mice (Punj et al, 2004; 
Jia et al, 2011; Mehta et al, 2011). When tumours reached 3 mm in 
diameter, animals were randomised into control (20 mice) and

of their patients about the principles and practice of orthodontic 
treatment; which can be very beneficial to the patient's lifestyle. 
It is, therefore, important to identify their level of knowledge and 
attitude toward orthodontic treatment. This study was planned 
to study this aspect in the form of comparative analysis in general 
dental practitioners and other specialties (except orthodontia) in 
dentistry. 
Materials and Methods: The study was done on 78 dentists, 
which was divided into two groups. Group I consisted of 46 
general dental practitioners and Group II consisted of 32 non-
orthodontic specialties. The study was carried out with the help of 
21 questionnaires, which consisted of 13 questions of orthodontic 
knowledge and 08 questions about the attitude toward orthodontic 
practice. The scores were calculated, and statistical analysis was 
done with the help of <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs> <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> statistics <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">20</rs>, using Student's t-test. 
Results: The comparative analysis showed highly significant 
difference of knowledge and attitude score between general dental 
practitioners and non-orthodontic specialties (Student's t-test, 
P &lt; 0.001). Also the comparison was made between male and 
female practitioners, who showed more scores in case of male 
practitioners; but the difference was not significant statistically 
(Student's t-test, P &gt; 0.01). 
Conclusion: The results of the study were moderately satisfactory, 
and it showed the need for increased clinically oriented education 
of practice and concepts of orthodontic treatment. </p>

<p>The mold consisted of a base was scored with 3 horizontal lines 
perpendicular to 2 vertical lines with each 0.050 mm wide. 
3.8 mm internal diameter steel ring was positioned accurately 
on the base and perforated steel plate was used to apply pressure 
after loading elastomers. Initially, the metal ring was placed 
on the base of the mold fallowed by direct injection of light 
body material onto platform. Then tray material was mixed 
and loaded according to manufacturer instruction. Excess 
materials were removed through perforation. The specimens 
were allowed to set in thermostatically controlled water bath at 
37°C to simulate oral condition. Total of 30 specimens with 10 
for each group (materials) were fabricated. After fabricating the 
samples, the distance between the inner profiles of horizontal 
line was measured (0.005 mm) using microscope before and 
after subjecting to disinfection with autoclave (Group-1), 
chemical -1% sodium hypochlorite (Group-2), and microwave 
(Group-3) methods by same examiner. Mean values were 
tabulated and analyzed using t-test and <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs>

<p>] o ϭ 143 mM). The intracellular free calcium 
concentration of this solution was estimated to be 10 nM (29). 
The recording chamber comprised a 35-mm Petri dish on 
which the cells were cultivated. Using a gravity-feed system, the 
chamber was superfused routinely at ϳ5 ml/min, at room tem-
perature (20 -23°C), with extracellular solutions of the compo-
sitions described below. Single channel currents evoked by 
pressure-applied 5-HT (10 M) were recorded in an extracellu-
lar solution (E1) consisting of 142.8 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl 2 , 
0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted 
by 1 M NaOH; final [Na 
ϩ ] o ϭ 146 mM). Whole-cell recording 
was used to determine the reversal potentials (E 5-HT ) of macro-
scopic currents elicited by 5-HT (10 M) by means of a voltage-
ramp protocol using <rs id="software-0" type="software">WinWCP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V3 9.6</rs> electrophysiology 
software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">J. Dempster</rs>, Department of Physiology and Pharma-
cology, University of Strathclyde, UK; available on the World 
Wide Web). Unless stated otherwise, E 5-HT was determined via 
a protocol wherein the membrane potential was initially set at 
Ϫ60 mV, and a macroscopic current response to 5-HT was 
elicited. During the plateau of the current response, the mem-
brane potential was stepped from Ϫ60 to Ϫ100 mV for 100 ms 
and subsequently ramped to ϩ80 mV within 1 s. Care was taken 
to ensure that the current amplitude at the beginning and ter-
mination of the voltage ramp protocol were similar. An identi-
cal voltage ramp in the absence of 5-HT served to determine the 
leakage current and was subtracted from the currents evoked in 
the presence of 5-HT to generate the current-voltage (I-V) rela-
tionship specifically attributable to the 5-HT-evoked conduct-
ance. E 5-HT was determined from such leak-subtracted cur-
rents. In order to determine the permeability of Na 
ϩ relative to 
Cs 
ϩ (P Na /P Cs ), E 5-HT was determined in solution E1, and the 
permeability ratio was calculated from the Goldman-Hodgkin-
Katz (GHK) (voltage) equation, </p>

<p>For simplicity, we routinely refer to ion concentrations 
rather than activities throughout, although the latter were 
employed in the calculations of relative permeabilities. 
To examine modulation of ␥ by extracellular Ca 
2ϩ , single 
channel recordings and determinations of E 5-HT were also 
made in extracellular solutions (E3, E4, and E5) containing vari-
able [CaCl 2 ] o (0.1, 1, and 10 mM, respectively) but constant 
[NaCl] o (95 mM), L-histidine (5 mM), and glucose 10 (mM), pH 
7.2. The osmolarity of such solutions was held constant by the 
addition of appropriate amounts of sucrose. An extracellular 
solution (E6) containing 20 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM 
CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, 239.4 mM sucrose, 5 mM L-histidine, pH 
7.2 (adjusted by 1 M HCl), in addition to solutions E1 and E3, 
was used to perform dilution potential measurements in order 
to determine relative permeability to chloride. Liquid junction 
potentials between the pipette tip and extracellular solutions 
were measured according to Fenwick et al. (29) and were cor-
rected post hoc. In brief, the zero current voltage was initially 
determined with the intracellular solution present within both 
the patch pipette and the bath. The extracellular solutions (E1-
E6) used in the experiments then replaced the intracellular 
solution, and the change in zero current voltage (i.e. the liquid 
junction potential) was noted. A salt bridge consisting of 3 M 
KCl in 4% (w/v) agar connected the bath to the reference elec-
trode, eliminating changes in the potential of the latter during 
this procedure. 
Single channel currents were low pass-filtered offline at 1 
kHz, digitized at 10 kHz via a <rs id="software-1" type="software">DigiData</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">1302A</rs> (Axon Instru-

Data Recorder (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">J. Dempster</rs>, Department of Physiology and 
Pharmacology, University of Strathclyde, UK; available on the 
World Wide Web), single channel current amplitude histo-
grams were constructed from sections of single channel activity 
in which unitary events predominated, as described in detail 
previously (20). The ␥ value is routinely reported as the chord 
conductance (i.e. ␥ ϭ i/(V m Ϫ E 5-HT ), where i is single channel 
current amplitude, V m is the holding potential (including liquid 
junction potential correction), and E 5-HT is the reversal poten-
tial of the agonist-evoked macroscopic response determined as 
described above under the appropriate ionic conditions. In the 
case of the 5-HT3A(QDA) D127K mutant, single channel cur-
rents could not be resolved directly in recording from outside-
out membrane patches. Thus, we estimated ␥ by fluctuation 
analysis of whole-cell current evoked by 5-HT (1 M) as previ-
ously described by us (16). A rectification index (RI) is used to </p>

<p>Background: The demand for reconstructive breast procedures of various types 
has accelerated in recent years. Coupled with increased patient expectations, it has 
fostered the development of oncoplastic and reconstructive techniques in breast 
surgery. In the setting of postmastectomy reconstruction, patient satisfaction and 
quality of life are the most significant outcome variables when evaluating surgical 
success. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of life after implant breast 
reconstruction compared with autologous breast reconstruction. 
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. A total of 
65 women who had completed postmastectomy implant-based or autologous 
reconstruction in the participating center were asked to complete the <rs type="software">BREAST-Q</rs> 
(Reconstruction Module). 
Results: Data analysis demonstrated that women with autologous breast recon-
struction were significantly more satisfied with their breasts (P = 0.0003) and with 
the overall outcome (P = 0.0001) compared with women with implant breast re-
construction. All other <rs type="software">BREAST-Q</rs> parameters that were considered and observed 
were not significantly different between the 2 patient groups. 
Conclusions: Through statistical analysis, our results showed that patients who under-
went autologous tissue reconstruction had better satisfaction with the reconstructed 
breast and the outcome, while both techniques appear to equally improve psychoso-
cial well-being, sexual well-being, and chest satisfaction. Ortensia Pirro, MD*

<p>Comparison of Patient-reported Outcomes 
after Implant Versus Autologous Tissue Breast 
Reconstruction Using the <rs type="software">BREAST-Q</rs> </p>

<p>The aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare 
the quality of life in women who underwent breast re-
construction with implants with those who underwent 
free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) 
flap breast reconstruction, using <rs type="software">BREAST-Q</rs> 
11 to appraise 
patient-reported outcomes. </p>

<p>A cross-sectional study design was used. Recruitment 
of patients was based on electronic medical records anal-
ysis. Afterward description of the study and a <rs type="software">BREAST-Q</rs> 
breast reconstruction postoperative questionnaire were 
sent to both groups of patients (50 letters for each group). 
The questionnaire booklet was mailed along with a self-
addressed, postage-paid return envelope according to the 
type of reconstruction. The questionnaires were marked 
with different colors to differentiate between implant breast 
reconstruction and autologous breast reconstruction. We 
received responses from 34 patients who underwent im-
plant breast reconstruction and 31 patients who underwent 
free TRAM flap reconstruction, giving a total of 65 patients. </p>

<p>The BREAST-Q (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the University of British Columbia</rs>, 2006, all 
rights reserved) is a patient-reported outcome measure 
that was specifically designed to measure the quality of life 
and patient satisfaction among breast surgery patients. </p>

<p>The instrument was developed and validated with adher-
ence to guidelines set by the Scientific Advisory Commit-
tee of the Medical Outcomes Trust (2002) and the US 
Food and Drug Administration. 
12-15 The <rs type="software">BREAST-Q</rs> recon-
struction module was used as the primary outcome mea-
sure in this study. </p>

<p>The scales forming the <rs type="software">BREAST-Q</rs> reconstruction 
module are as follows: satisfaction with breasts, satisfaction 
with the overall outcome, psychosocial well-being, sexual 
well-being, physical well-being of the chest, satisfaction 
with nipple areola reconstruction, satisfaction with infor-
mation, satisfaction with the surgeon, satisfaction with the 
medical team, and satisfaction with the office staff. 
The patients' responses to each scale's items were 
analyzed through the Q Score that analyses data based 
on <rs id="software-9" type="software">RUMM</rs> <rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">2020</rs>, a data-analyzing program developed by 
<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Models Laboratory.</rs>. 
This software automatically transforms raw data into sum-
mary scores that range from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 100 
(very satisfied) for each scale. For all <rs type="software">BREAST-Q</rs> scales, a 
higher score indicates greater satisfaction or better qual-
ity of life. A mean change of 5 to 10 on a multi-item scale 
is perceived as "a little" change, 10 to 20 as "a moderate" 
change, and greater than 20 as "a maximal" change. 
Before commencing the study, the questionnaire had a 
Czech translation validated in accordance with the agree-
ment with the MAPI Trust (http:// www.mapi-trust.org/).

defined. Data were initially transformed for dye-swap for the 
appropriate samples, and all intensity values less than 0.01 or that 
were negative were converted to 0.01 to reset biologically irrelevant 
or otherwise unacceptable expression values. Following background 
subtraction and elimination of all spots flagged as marginal or 
absent, data were normalized using an intensity dependent LOW-

<p>All data files were transmitted to the bioinformatics data-process-
ing lab for analysis after converting to the standard mzXML format 
(32, 33) and then searched with <rs id="software-6" type="software">X! Tandem</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-date">January 1, 2007</rs> release) 
configured with a scoring function (24) compatible with <rs type="software">Peptide-
Prophet</rs> (25) and <rs type="software">ProteinProphet</rs> (26). The same database (human 
IPI version 3.20 consisting of 61,225 IPI numbers) was used to search 
all data. <rs id="software-9" type="software">PeptideProphet</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">version 3.0</rs>) and <rs id="software-10" type="software">ProteinProphet</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">version 3.0</rs>) 
were used to assign identified peptide and protein confidence scores 
for all but Lab 1 (details described below) where the complexity of 
samples interrogated was not sufficient to estimate the Peptide-
Prophet error model. Quantitation was performed following tryptic 
search and protein inference. Finally multiple experiments within a lab 
were then aligned to create analytic data sets sufficient to determine 
relative disease status. 
The following common criteria were applied to all searches. A 
Ϯ2.0-Da error from the calculated peptide monoisotopic mass was 
allowed to determine whether a particular peptide sequence is to be 
considered as a possible model for a spectrum. Mass tolerance for 
fragment ions was 1 Da (24). The maximal number of missed cleav-
ages permitted was 2. A static modification on cysteines of ϩ57.021 
Da was used for all labs except Lab 4, which performed acrylamide 
labeling on cysteines. A potential modification on methionines of 
ϩ15.9949 Da was used. A weighted average mass was used to 
calculate the masses of the fragment ions in a tandem mass spec-
trum. A minimum number of one ion was required for a peptide to be 
scored. A default minimum <rs type="software">PeptideProphet</rs> probability of 0.2 was 
used to calculate the protein group probability. Only peptides with 
probability Ն0.75 and mass error Ͻ20 ppm were selected for quan-
titation. Specific search parameters for the different labeling schemes 
by different labs are specified in the supplemental text, Part B. The 
following are descriptions of the software used for each lab's data 
and quantitation methods (summarized in supplemental Table S2) 
during data processing. 
Lab 1-Lab 1 used a DIGE method and quantitated a large number 
of fluorescent spots with two commercial software algorithms (<rs id="software-12" type="software">DeCyder</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">6.5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-12" type="creator">GE Healthcare</rs>) and <rs id="software-13" type="software">SameSpots</rs> <rs corresp="#software-13" type="version-number">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-13" type="creator">Nonlinear Dynamics</rs>)). A </p>

<p>t test was performed on the log ratios using <rs id="software-14" type="software">Statistica</rs> for Windows 
(<rs corresp="#software-14" type="creator">StatSoft, Inc.</rs>.) <rs corresp="#software-14" type="version-number">version 7</rs> to estimate the significant difference of a 
protein. Only those spots found to have significant changes, based on 
fluorescence, between the HD and the control were selected for 
tandem MS analysis. Peak lists of MS/MS spectra acquired on the 
HCT-Ultra ion trap instrument (Bruker Daltonics) were generated us-
ing the software tool <rs id="software-15" type="software">DataAnalysis</rs> <rs corresp="#software-15" type="version-number">3.4.179</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-15" type="creator">Bruker Daltonics</rs>) with 
default parameters. The built-in algorithm version 2.0 was used, and 
neither smoothing nor any signal-to-noise filter was applied for com-
pound detection. A maximum charge state of 3 was considered for 
deconvolution. Data were then converted to mzXML files using 
<rs id="software-16" type="software">CompassXport</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-16" type="version-number">version 1.2.3</rs>). Peptides were identified using decoy 
database methods with an approach described by Elias and Gygi (34). 
After proteins were identified for selected spots using false discovery 
rate (FDR) and <rs type="software">ProteinProphet</rs> (see details in the supplemental text, 
Part B), quantitation of -fold changes among different disease sta-
tuses was processed based on the following rules. 1) If a spot was 
quantitated by both <rs id="software-18" type="software">DeCyder</rs> <rs corresp="#software-18" type="version-number">6.5</rs> and <rs type="software">SameSpots</rs> methods, -fold 
changes by DeCyder 6.5 were selected because the differential ex-
pression resulting from this method is more significant on average. On 
the other hand, if only one quantitation method was used, results from 
that method were selected. 2) When multiple spots have the same 
protein identification, -fold changes were averaged for that protein. 3) 
When a spot resulted in several protein identifications, the same -fold 
changes were assigned to all proteins. 
Lab 2-Lab 2 performed label-free analysis. Peak lists were gen-
erated using <rs id="software-21" type="software">MassLynx</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-21" type="version-number">4.0</rs>) based on signals obtained by Q-ToF 
Micro spectrometer from Waters Micromass. The MS duty cycle was 
set at 1,1,4 as described in detail in the supplemental text, Part A. 
These data were converted to mzXML files using <rs id="software-22" type="software">MassWolf</rs> <rs corresp="#software-22" type="version-number">1.02</rs> with 
the Waters Datafile Access Component (DAC) library. Following the 
database search using the common criteria, quantitation was per-
formed using a spectral count approach (35), which sums the number 
of total spectra assigned to the protein group in that sample. Only 
peptide spectra with <rs type="software">PeptideProphet</rs> probability greater than 0.75 or 
an error rate of 5% were counted for each IPI entry identified. Be-
cause individual level variation can be determined for this design, we 
used a straightforward procedure that tracks all proteins that are 
members of a single ProteinProphet group within the experiment to 
associate groups across multiple experiments and to flag groups that 
are not directly comparable (supplemental text, Part B). After sum-
ming up to master protein groups across samples, the average spec-
tral count of all IPI entries within a "master group" was assigned to 
that group. For each master group, total spectral counts from 10 
HD-mid samples, 10 HD-early samples, and 10 control samples were 
summed up and used to calculate HD-mid/control, HD-early/control, 
and HD-mid/HD-early ratios. Intensity-dependent ratio plots (MA </p>

<p>plots) and histograms of light/heavy ratios were examined to ensure 
the quality of data for the labeled experiments. M is the y-axis and A 
is the x-axis, where in this paper, M ϭ Log 2 (Heavy) Ϫ Log 2 (Light); 
A ϭ [ 1 ⁄2] (Log 2 (Heavy) ϩ Log 2 (Light)). 
Lab 3-Data from Lab 3 were acquired from the LTQ-FT instrument 
(Thermo Finnigan). Peak lists were generated by <rs id="software-24" type="software">Xcalibur</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-24" type="version-number">version 1.1</rs>) 
and converted to mzXML files using <rs id="software-25" type="software">ReAdW</rs> <rs corresp="#software-25" type="version-number">1.1</rs> with XRawfile library. 
Default parameters were used. Database search was carried out 
using the common parameters and the designated specific modifica-
tions (supplemental text, Part B). Protein groups with probability 
score Ͼ0.9 (corresponding to an overall error rate of 0.01) were 
considered confident proteins for downstream analysis. The Q3 al-
gorithm (27), developed to accommodate a 3-dalton mass shift in 
heavy and light peptides, was used to compute the ratios between the 
light and heavy isotopic pairs using peak areas. More specifically, 
only confidently identified peptides (<rs type="software">PeptideProphet</rs> probability 
Ͼ0.75 and mass error Ͻ20 ppm) were selected for further quantita-
tion at the protein level. In three pairwise comparisons, the internal 
standard (IS) containing equal amounts of 30 samples was labeled 
with light acetyl group, and each of the three disease statuses (A, B, 
or C) was labeled with heavy acetyl group (for details, see supple-
mental text, Part A). Preliminary analysis found that light/heavy ratios 
were skewed for both IS versus HD-early and IS versus HD-mid 
experiments. Because the same amount of protein was loaded into 
the MS instrument and, in theory, most proteins in the disease and 
control should remain unchanged, we normalized these ratios. Nor-
malization at the peptide level was performed by median centering 
the log ratios. Experiments were then aligned to infer the protein 
changes of different disease status comparisons. Protein inference 
was performed using the <rs type="software">ProteinProphet</rs> analysis tool at the lab level, 
and light/heavy ratios of these protein groups were inferred from 
ratios at the experiment level by comparing IPI numbers. HD-mid 
versus control, HD-early versus control, and HD-mid versus HD-early 
ratios for each protein group were calculated using IS/control, IS/HD-
mid, and IS/HD-early ratios from the three experiments. 
Lab 4 -LTQ OrbiTrap XL mass spectrometer from Thermo Finni-
gan was used, and <rs id="software-28" type="software">Xcalibur</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-28" type="version-number">version 2.2</rs>) was applied to generate 
peak lists. Data were converted to mzXML files using <rs id="software-29" type="software">ReAdW</rs> <rs corresp="#software-29" type="version-number">1.1</rs> with 
XRawfile library. Default parameters were used. Data were then 
searched with the common criteria plus specific modifications. Pro-
tein groups with probability score Ͼ0.9 (corresponding to an overall 
error rate of 0.01) were considered confident proteins for downstream 
analysis. For the labeled analysis, as with Lab 3, the Q3 algorithm (27) 
was used to compute ratios between light and heavy isotopic pairs. 
And similarly to the methods used for Lab 3, peptides with Peptide-
Prophet scores greater than 0.75 and a mass error of less than 20 
ppm were selected for the protein level quantitation. Histograms of 
light/heavy ratios based on the number of cysteines in the peptides 
revealed that peptides with one cysteine have better normal distribu-
tions than peptides with more than one cysteine. Because 80% of 
peptides contain only one cysteine, only peptides with one cysteine 
were selected for protein level analysis. To ensure a high confidence 
of quantitation at the protein level, only those proteins with at least 
three quantitated peptides were used for further analysis. For the 
label-free analysis, accurate mass and time (AMT) methods were used 
to identify peptides in LC-MS data using a single AMT database 
containing all high quality (<rs type="software">PeptideProphet</rs> probability Ն0.95) peptide 
identifications from all labeled (fractionated) and unlabeled (unfrac-
tionated) data from Lab 4. The LC-MS peptide features from each 
unlabeled sample were matched against the combined AMT data-
base to provide peptide assignments. Each match was assigned a 
probability value based on mass error and normalized retention time 
error between the MS1 feature and the AMT peptide entry, and only 
matches with probability Ն0.95 or a false assignment rate Յ0.05 were </p>

<p>kept. LC-MS peptide intensity values for the peptides were normal-
ized across runs, and peptide ratios were calculated. The AMT data-
base and matching were performed using the <rs type="software">msInspect/AMT</rs> soft-
ware platform (36, 37). Protein inference was performed using 
<rs type="software">ProteinProphet</rs>, and protein ratios were calculated as well. As with the 
Lab 3 analysis, experiments were aligned using the ProteinProphet 
analysis tool at the lab level to infer the protein changes of different 
disease status comparisons for the labeled and unlabeled methods. 
Ratios of these protein groups were inferred from ratios at the exper-
iment level by IPI numbers. </p>

<p>Proteins, identified by their IPI sequence, were assigned to gene 
symbols by IPI protein cross-reference. Because the peptide level 
evidence cannot uniquely identify all IPI sequences, proteins were 
assembled by <rs type="software">ProteinProphet</rs> into groups (26). Some of these protein 
groups contain unique protein sequences and gene symbols, and some 
contain multiple sequences that may result from the same gene symbol 
or from multiple genes within the same family (e.g. a protein group is 
assigned with HBG2, HBE1, HBG1, HBB, and HBD, all of which belong 
to the hemoglobin gene family) or multiple incompatible genes. </p>

<p>We next annotated each protein in the synthesized protein list 
based on its behavior found in human transcriptional profiles of HD 
and normal brain (2) and other tissues (29). Specifically we annotated 
proteins based on 1) tissue specificity score: the relative expression of 
transcript in human brain, liver, and 25 other normal human tissues; 
and 2) changes in HD brain: the ratio of transcript abundance be-
tween HD and non-HD brains. All annotations were made by com-
paring gene symbols. IPI numbers identified in our proteomics study 
were associated with gene symbols by reference to the data 
(ipi.HUMAN.v3.20.dat) provided by the International Protein Index 
managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute. 
Annotation of Protein Changes in CSF with Changes in the HD 
Brain by Microarray Analysis-We compared protein changes from 
this proteomics study with the log 2 -fold changes of mRNA in HD 
versus normal brain in caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and motor cortex 
(Brodmann area 4 (BA4)) based on a previously published study by 
Hodges et al. (2). Probe sets with significant changes (p values 
Ͻ0.001) were selected and collapsed to gene level based on gene 
symbols. When a gene has multiple probe sets, the median log 2 -fold 
change of that gene was selected as the estimate of the mRNA 
change. As a result, 6183 genes in caudate nucleus, 1143 genes in 
BA4 cortex, and 440 in cerebellum have significant mRNA changes in 
HD brains from the normal. 
Signal Processing of Tissue Transcriptional Expression Data-Be-
cause a significant fraction of plasma proteins is derived from various 
tissues and so are CSF proteins, which are filtered from plasma, to 
annotate proteins for their source tissues, it is critical that the tran-
scriptional data set includes tissues of human major organs. The 
normal human tissue expression data set was acquired from pub-
lished data provided by Ge et al. (29) that includes a total of 36 types 
of normal human tissue, covering the complexity of human tissues. 
Because all CSF samples are from adult human, the annotation will 
focus on the adult tissue expression pattern. Therefore, data from 
three fetal tissues were removed. Ge et al. (29) examined a "whole 
brain" and six subregions of the brain (amygdala, corpus callosum, 
caudate nucleus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and thalamus). How-
ever, the cortex region that is noted to have severe cell loss in 
Huntington disease patients was not included. We removed the 
"whole-brain" data because it is not obvious to us how this RNA 
sample was prepared. We added the cortex signals and substituted 
cerebellum and caudate nucleus data with data derived from an 
extensive study that was carried out on four parts of human normal 
brain (caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and BA4 and BA9 cortex) using 
the same microarray chips (2). After these brain data were obtained 
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets, signals detected 
using <rs id="software-35" type="software">Affymetrix microarray suite</rs> <rs corresp="#software-35" type="version-number">version 5</rs> software (MAS5) for each 
probe were averaged over 21 caudate nucleus, 21 cerebellum, and 24 
cortex (12 BA4 and 12 BA9) arrays. We plotted log 2 MAS5 signal of 
the caudate nucleus and cerebellum from Ge et al. (29) versus those 
from Hodges et al. (2) and found that the correlations are both 0.90 
(supplemental Fig. S1). These high correlations suggest that data 
from the two studies may be combined. So far, we have data for 
seven subregions of the brain. Because we want to annotate a gene 
as being active in the brain if it is active in any part of the brain, we 
summarized the brain expression data by taking the maximum across 
all seven subregions. As a result, transcriptional data of "brain tis-
sues" and 26 other types of human tissues were included in our 
analysis. These tissues are from brain, heart, thymus, spleen, ovary, 
kidney, muscle, pancreas, prostate, intestine, colon, placenta, blad-
der, breast, uterus, thyroid, skin, salivary, trachea, adrenal, bone 
marrow, pituitary, spinal cord, testis, liver, stomach, and lung (sup-
plemental Table S5). Finally many genes have multiple probes; one </p>

<p>General Work Flow of the Primary Data Analysis-All pro-
teomics data acquired by four laboratories utilizing different 
proteomics platforms were interpreted using a common pro-
tein database as well as the same search engine and peptide 
and protein validation methods to allow comparison across 
labs. The flow of data analysis is as follows. 1) Data sets 
generated based on each experimental design were searched 
with protein database independently. 2) Multiple data sets 
from the same experiment were aligned to determine the 
protein changes between different disease statuses. 3) Data 
were aligned across labs, and protein ratios were synthesized 
for the consistency of protein changes. 4) Proteins identified 
were assessed for their dominant expression tissues based 
on published human and mouse tissue expression data. The 
abundances of brain and liver proteins in CSF were compared 
with those in plasma. 5) Finally protein changes were inte-
grated with the genomics profiling of mRNA changes in nor-
mal versus HD brain. Results from each step of analysis are 
presented sequentially. 
Analysis of Proteomics Data-Search engine performance 
and <rs type="software">PeptideProphet</rs> details (25) were inspected (supplemen-
tal Fig. S2A) to assure that sensitivity and error distributions 
were sufficient to determine correct and incorrect identifica-
tions from Labs 2, 3, and 4. The quality of data quantitation 
was determined by examining MA plots, histograms of light 
labeled/heavy labeled ratios at the peptide level, and histo-
grams of the HD-early/control, HD-mid/control, and HD-mid/ 
HD-early ratios at the protein level (supplemental Fig. S2, 
B-D). We observed that the distributions of logarithms of 
ratios are around 0 before normalization for all experiments 
except two interrogations from Lab 3. The log ratios for these 
two data sets were normalized to have a median of 0. 
Lab 1 used a DIGE method (see "Experimental Proce-
dures") and quantitated a large number of fluorescent spots. 
Only those spots found to have significantly different changes 
based on fluorescence between the HD and control CSF were 
selected for tandem MS analysis. As a result, a total of 19 
unique proteins for 42 spots were identified based on the 
MS/MS data (Table II), each of which is a putative biomarker </p>

<p>candidate. As a verification of these protein identifications 
("Experimental Procedures"), we compared them with the 
results provided by Lab 1 using the Mascot search engine 
(supplemental Table S9) and found that there is a high con-
sistency between the two results. In addition, proteins from 
more spots have been identified in this study. Lab 2 is the only 
lab that performed individual (non-pooled) interrogation. 335 
confident protein groups (with <rs type="software">ProteinProphet</rs> probability Ͼ0.9) 
were found and of these, 319 were quantitated using spectral 
counting (35) of highly confident peptide spectra ("Experimen-
tal Procedures"). Lab 3 pooled samples by disease status and 
analyzed by d 0 /d 3 acetylation of the N terminus of the pep-
tides. 263 confident protein groups were found after aligning 
the three experiments using <rs type="software">ProteinProphet</rs>. After protein ra-
tios were inferred from individual experiments, 161 were con-
fidently quantitated. Lab 4 pooled samples by disease status 
and gender. In three pairwise comparisons, proteins in pooled 
CSF of two disease statuses were differentially labeled with 
light and heavy acrylamide on cysteine residues. Because a 
more extensive prefractionation strategy was used, these 
data resulted in identification of the majority of proteins (1179 
groups) reported in this study of which 377 were confidently 
quantitated by the Q3 algorithm (27) ("Experimental Proce-
dures"). In addition, Lab 4's label-free analysis using AMT 
methods (37) identified and quantitated 277 protein groups 
(Table II), ϳ100 of which are not quantitated by the labeled 
approach (Table III). 
Overall the number of proteins identified is highly related to 
the number of sample fractions and to the number of MS/MS 
spectra obtained. Because of the limited publication space 
and the large amount of data, all the confident protein groups 
identified and their quantitation results from each lab are 
provided in supplemental spreadsheets (supplemental Table 
S3). For each protein group (probability Ͼ0.9) identified, the 
number of total and unique peptide identifications are pro-
vided in the spreadsheets. p values (Lab 1 and Lab 2) and 
standard deviations (Lab 3 and Lab 4) are also included to 
indicate the significant changes and accuracy of the quanti-
tations. In practice, one can use these values as filters to </p>

While Pasteurella species are well recognized for causing skin or 
soft tissue infections, P dagmatis can also cause more serious disease, 
including infective and prosthetic valve endocarditis (10,14,15), 
septicemia (11,12,16), peritonitis (17), vertebral osteomyelitis 
(18,19), chronic bronchiectasis (20) and pneumonia (21), mainly in 
immunocompromised patients. A small number of case reports 
describing systemic human P dagmatis infections are listed in 
Table 3. Interestingly, while Pasturella species infrequently cause 
systemic infectious disease, in our review of the literature, when P 
dagmatis infections are reported, they appear to be frequently associ-
ated with severe disseminated infection including bacteremia. 
Coinfections of P dagmatis with another Pasturella species have also 
been observed (9,12,22); therefore, it is important for the laboratory 
to test multiple morphotypes from the plate to ensure that &gt;1 
Pasturella species is not present. 
Similar to other Pasturella species, P dagmatis is typically highly 
susceptible to many antibiotics, particularly, the beta-lactams 
(Table 1). Early suspicion and timely laboratory diagnosis of 
Pasturella infection are crucial for a favourable clinical outcome. 
Several reports have demonstrated that the VITEK 2 GN card 
misidentifies P dagmatis as P pneumotropica or P canis, despite an 
excellent identification probability (9,15,23,24). This is most likely 
because P dagmatis has not been included in the system database; 
as well, there has been a nomenclature change because P dagmatis 
was formerly grouped with P pneumotropica, type Henriksen. In a 
study that included 66 clinical Pasturella isolates and used sodA gene 
sequencing as a reference method, Zangenah et al (24) revealed that 
<rs type="software">VITEK 2</rs> only identified approximately 50% of Pasturella isolates 
correctly, while conventional biochemical tests and MALDI-ToF 
MS were able to correctly identify 94% and 89%, respectively. 
Interestingly, in the Zangenah et al (24) study, two P dagmatis isolates 
were not identified by VITEK MS MALDI-ToF (BioMerieux, France) 
and this limitation was also observed in our study (data not shown). 
The biological and genetic profiles among P dagmatis, P pneumotropica 
and P stomatis are very similar (Table 2); both a commercial biochem-
ical identification system and the sequence analysis of a portion of the 
16S rRNA gene were unable to differentiate between these species. </p>

<p>Correct identification was made using MALDI-ToF MS (MALDI 
Biotyper, Bruker, Germany) and was also supported by comparing 
the key biochemical characteristics among P dagmatis, P pneumo-
tropica and P stomatis (Table 2). It is probable that many clinical 
isolates of P dagmatis have been misidentified due to the limitation 
of commercial biochemical identification systems, such as <rs type="software">VITEK 
2</rs>. Misidentification may have contributed to an underestimation 
of the frequency of this organism in clinical samples; however, the 
growing use of MALDI-ToF MS systems for microorganism identifi-
cation in routine clinical microbiology laboratories may allow for a 
more accurate picture of how frequently P dagmatis causes infections. 
Correct identification is important for diagnosis and therapeutic 
management, and epidemiological monitoring of the transmission of 
Pasturella species, particularly for the systemic infections such as in 
the present case. Unfortunately, most routine methods available at 
hospital laboratories cannot identify the organism correctly. </p>

<p>P dagmatis can cause severe animal-associated infections in humans, 
mainly in immunocompromised individuals. To our knowledge, this 
is the first systemic P dagmatis infection reported in Canada. Clinical 
outcomes rely on early accurate laboratory confirmation and timely 
administration of effective antibiotic treatment. Conventional iden-
tification of P dagmatis using <rs type="software">VITEK 2</rs> can be misleading, probably 
due to the absence of this organism from the database; 16S rRNA 
gene sequence analysis and MALDI-ToF MS systems represent excel-
lent options for identifying rarely encountered or difficult to identify 
organisms, such as members of the Pasturellaceae family. The present 
study re-emphasizes the need for continuously improving the data-
base of automatic microbial identification systems. </p>

<p>A complete lung function test was carried out before and 
20 minutes after inhalation of 400 μg of salbutamol using 
a spirometer (EasyOne-PC 
® , NDD Medizintechnik AG, 
Zurich, Switzerland), and the values of forced vital capac-
ity (FVC), FEV 1 , and FEV 1 /FVC ratio were analyzed. The 
test was performed according to the American Thoracic 
Society guidelines, 
20 and reference values for the Brazilian 
population 
21,22,23 were used. FVC and FEV 1 were expressed 
as percent of the predicted value. 
VC was performed using a CO 2 SMOS Plus 8100 Dixtal/ 
Novametrix 
® (Respironics, Murrisville, PA, USA). The sub-
jects remained breathing tidal volume for 4 minutes. During 
this time, the variables were measured and data was stored in 
a computer with the <rs type="software">Analysis Plus</rs> 
® software. At the end of 
data collection, an offline sequence of the respiratory cycles 
of the subjects was selected to accommodate a variation 
of ,15% for expiratory tidal volume and of ,5% for ETCO 2 </p>

<p>tension. Respiratory cycles that had Slp2 and Slp3 equal 
to zero were excluded. The main variables analyzed were 
ETCO 2 , Slp2, Slp3, inspiratory time (T i ), expiratory time 
(T e ), and expiratory volume (V e ). Both slopes are given by 
the <rs type="software">Analysis Plus</rs> 
® software. An example of a capnogram, 
which represents the total amount of CO 2 eliminated by the 
lungs during each breath, can be seen in Figure 1. </p>

<p>Group data were expressed as the mean ± standard devia-
tion for functional data. The comparison between groups for 
categorical variables was performed using the chi-square test 
or Fisher's exact test. The comparison between groups for 
numerical variables was performed using Mann-Whitney 
Utest. The correlation between numerical variables was 
assessed using the Spearman's correlation coefficient. 
A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant for the 
results of all statistical analysis. Data analysis was performed 
using the <rs id="software-2" type="software">SAS</rs> System for Windows (Statistical Analysis 
System), <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 9.4</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., Cary, NC, USA). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using statistical package 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">21.0</rs>. Descriptive statistics were calculated. To deter-
mine whether there were differences between the transfem-
oral and transtibial amputee groups in terms of distribution 
by gender and walking with crutches the Chi-square test or 
Fisher Exact test were used. T-test or Mann-Whitney Rank 
Sum Test was used for comparison of differences on PCI and 
CWS between two amputation groups. The one way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison of differences 
between amputation groups and impact of using crutches on 
PCI and CWS. 
The correlation between the age and PCI or CWS by level 
of amputation was tested with simple linear regression anal-
ysis. </p>

<p>Metabolomic analyses of serum and brain microdialysate samples 
were performed at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland (Espoo, 
Finland). Additional analyses to identify metabolites of interest were 
also performed at LECO Corporation (St. Joseph, Michigan) and Steno 
Diabetes Center (Gentofte, Denmark). 
Serum samples (30 μl) or microdialysate samples (100 μl) were 
spiked with 10 μl of internal standard mixture (C17:0 (186,5 mg/l), deu-
terated valine (37 mg/l) and succinic acid-d4 (63 mg/l). The protein 
precipitation was done as follows: 400 μl of methanol was added 
and then the samples were vortexed for 2 min. After centrifugation 
(5 min at 7800 g at room temperature) and settling for 30 min at 
− 20°C the supernatant was evaporated to dryness under gentle 
flow of nitrogen before derivatization. The original metabolites 
were then converted into their methoxime and trimethylsilyl (TMS) 
derivatives by two-step derivatization. First, 25 μl of methoxyamine 
hydrochloride (98%) was added to the residue, and the mixture was 
incubated for 60 min at 45°C. Next, 25 μl of N-methyl-N-
trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide was added, and the mixture was 
incubated for 60 min at 45°C. Finally, a retention index standard 
mixture (n-alkanes, 25 μl, c = 8 mg/l) and an injection standard (4,4′-
dibromooctafluorobiphenyl, 50 μl, c = 10 mg/l), both in hexane, were 
added to the mixture. 
GC × GC-TOFMS analyses were carried out on an Agilent 6890 gas 
chromatograph equipped with a split/splitless injector (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA), cryogenic dual-stage modulator and time-
of-flight mass spectrometer (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA). In addi-
tion, multipurpose sampler with Maestro software (Gerstel, Mülheim 
an der Ruhr, Germany) was used for derivatization and sample intro-
duction. A 10 m × 0.18 mm I.D. Rxi-5 ms (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, 
USA) column with film thickness 0.18 μm was used as the first column 
and a 1.5 m × 0.1 mm I.D. BPX-50 (SGE Analytical Science, Austin, TX, 
USA) column with film thickness of 0.1 μm as the second column. A phe-
nyl methyl deactivated retention gap column (1.5 m × 0.53 mm I.D.) 
was installed in front of the first column. The injector was used in the 
splitless mode at 240°C for injecting 1 μl of a sample. The splitless period 
was 90 s. High-purity helium (Aga, Espoo, Finland) was used as the car-
rier gas in a constant-pressure mode with initial pressure of 276 kPa. 
The first column oven temperature program was as follows: 50°C (iso-
thermal for 2 min) then 7°C/min to 240°C, and, finally, 25°/min to 
300°C (3 min). The second dimension column oven temperature was 
maintained 20°C higher and the programming rate and hold times 
were similar than in the first dimension. The temperature of the transfer 
line was maintained at 260°C and ion source at 200°C. Modulation time 
was 4 s. Electron impact ionization was applied at 70 eV, and the mass 
range from 45 to 700 amu with 100 spectra/s was measured. 
Automatic peak detection and mass spectrum deconvolution were 
performed using a peak width set to 0.2 s. Peaks with signal-to-noise 
(S/N) values lower than 100 were rejected. The S/N values were based 
on the masses chosen by the software for quantification. <rs id="software-1" type="software">ChromaTOF</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 4.32</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">LECO Corporation</rs>, St. Joseph, MI) was used for the raw 
data processing. The peak areas from total ion chromatography (TIC) 
were used for most of the compounds; for compounds that were quan-
tified with the <rs type="software">ChromaTOF</rs> software, peak areas of selected characteris-
tic m/z were used. 
Next, the data files obtained by the <rs type="software">ChromaTOF</rs> software were 
exported to text files and in-house developed software <rs id="software-3" type="software">Guineu</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Castillo</rs> et al., 2011) was used for aligning and normalization of com-
pounds for further analyses. The original GC × GC-TOFMS data includes 
retention times, retention indices (RI), spectral information (for possi-
ble identification), spectral similarity value (S = 0-999), and peak </p>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-4" type="software">MATLAB R2014b</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">The Mathworks, Inc.</rs>., Natick, MA, USA), applying in-house developed scripts

and <rs type="software">R</rs> Statistical Software using rms package (Harrell, 2015). 
The zero values in the metabolomics dataset were first imputed. For 
each metabolite, zero value was replaced by half the minimum non-
zero value of the metabolite across all samples. Due to the non-normal 
distribution of data, data were then log-transformed. The mean levels 
of the four study groups were compared using ANOVA on all 465 metab-
olites. In order to adjust for multiple testing, False Discovery Rates (FDR) 
were calculated (Storey, 2002), with FDR q-values b0.05 considered 
significant. The mean levels of each of the three TBI groups (mild, mod-
erate, and severe) were compared to the control group using two-sided 
t-test (unequal variance). </p>

derived from Eq. (1) under various substrate and inhibitor 
conditions were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis and 
fitted to the appropriate Eqs. (2)-(6) using the <rs type="software">GraphPad

equation for hyperbolic substrate saturation kinetics and Eq. 
(3) applies to the nonlinear regression of substrate inhibition. 
Eq. (4) is the Hill equation for calculating cooperative sub-
strate saturation kinetics, Eq. (5) applies to noncompetitive 
enzyme inhibition of a hyperbolic enzyme response and 
Eq. (6) is derived from combining Eqs. (4) and (5) to give an 
expression for noncompetitive enzyme inhibition of a 
cooperative sigmoidal response to increasing substrate concen-

<p>Analytical ultracentrifugation 
Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a 
Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped 
with absorbance optics. Mt-PrsA [dialyzed into 50 mM 
KH 2 PO 4 ( pH 7.9), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT] was loaded 
into cells with two channel Epon center pieces and quartz 
windows. A total of 100 absorbance scans (280 nm) were 
recorded (40,000 rpm, 4°C) for each sample, representing the 
full extent of sedimentation of the sample. Data analysis was 
performed using the <rs id="software-2" type="software">SEDFIT</rs> software fitting a single friction 
coefficient (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Schuck</rs> 2004). </p>

<p>ITF spectroscopy 
ITF experiments were carried out using a PTI QuantaMaster™ 
40 spectrofluorimeter and data recorded using the <rs type="software">FeliX32</rs> 
software. The excitation wavelength was set at 292 nm, and 
the fluorescence emission (F emission ) spectra were recorded 
between 300 and 400 nm for each ligand aliquot added to a 
200 µL solution containing 70 µM Mt-PrsA. 50 mM KH 2 PO 4 
( pH 7.9), 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM DTT, 2 mM MnCl 2 was 
used as a buffer for the measurement of R5P, ATP and 
AMPPNP ligand binding (or a combination) to Mt-PrsA. A 
plot of the change in fluorescence emission (ΔF emission ) inten-
sity at λ 335nm vs. [L] was fitted to Eq. (7) for R5P, Eq. (8) for 
ATP and ADP for independent additions, Eq. (9) for R5P in 
combination with AMPPNP and Eq. (10) for ATP and ADP in 
combination using <rs type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> software </p>

<p>(29, 30) and <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> Genome Browser release 63 (26), re-
spectively. Analysis results indicated that 874 miRNAs with 
MFE À20 and Score ! 150 interact with many possible 
target sites in 248 TPGs and their cognate genes and 
might potentially co-regulate this pair of TPG and parental 
gene (Supplementary File 2). </p>

<p>the TPG and the blue line refers to esiRNAs. We also esti-
mate the eSTIs (Figure 3E) and the RNA folding structure of 
TPG-derived esiRNA (Figure 3F). All the results and se-
quences can be downloaded for further experimental 
tests. In pseudoMap, we also incorporate the external 
sources, such as UCSC genome browser (39) for a genomic 
view, GeneCards (52) for gene annotation and miRBase (29) 
for miRNA annotation (Figure 3G). In addition, pseudoMap 
also consists of a tutorial and knowledge of pseudogenes. 
In the search gateway, the TPG ID, <rs type="software">Ensembl ID</rs>, TPG 
symbol and parental gene symbol are allowed for further 
analysis. Figure 4 displays the interface of output results 
with the search a particular TPG ID/<rs type="software">Ensembl ID</rs>/TPG 
symbol/parental gene symbol. The interface contains the 
general information of TPG, miRNA regulators, gene ex-
pression profiles and TPG-derived esiRNAs. </p>

<p>In pseudoMap, various databases are integrated and main-
tained with <rs id="software-5" type="software">MySQL</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.mysql.com</rs>/) relational 
database management system. While operating on an 
<rs id="software-6" type="software">Apache HTTP server</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="url">http://www.apache.org</rs>/) and PHP 
(http://www.php.net/) on a <rs id="software-7" type="software">Linux operation system</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-7" type="url">http:// www.linux.com</rs>), pseudoMap was constructed using the 
Smarty template engine (http://www.smarty.net). Based 
on PHP, JavaScript (http://www.javascriptsource.com/), CSS 
(http://www.w3schools.com/css/) and HTML (http://www. 
w3schools.com/html/) languages, the web interface enables 
dynamic <rs type="software">MySQL</rs> queries with user-friendly graphics. Above 
software are open source technologies. </p>

<p>A few databases have been constructed to explore pseudo-
genes. In particular, PseudoGene database (53) identifies 
pseudogenes using various computational methods in 
genomes; HOPPSIGEN (54) represents the homologous pro-
cessed pseudogenes shared between the mouse and human 
genomes that contains location information and potential 
function; as a web-based system, <rs type="software">PseudoGeneQuest</rs> (55) 
identifies novel human pseudogenes based on a user-
provided protein sequence; in addition, the University of 
Iowa's UI Pseudogenes website contains human pseudo-
genes and the candidates for gene conversion (56). 
However, these databases focus on automatic detection 
of pseudogenes by using a variety of homology-based 
approaches. Our database, pseudoMap, aims at providing 
comprehensive resource for genome-wide identifying the 
functions and regulators of human TPGs. In briefly, there 
are three major differentiating features from currently 
public databases of pseudogenes. First, pseudoMap eluci-
dates the relationships of TPG and its cognate gene with 
miRNA decoys mechanism. Second, to explore the inter-
action of TPG and its parental gene, pseudoMap provides 
the gene expression profiles of TPG and its cognate gene in 
various experimental conditions. Third, pseudoMap curates 
the TPG-derived esiRNAs, which supported by deep sequen-
cing data, as well as their interacting gene targets in the 
human genome. Table 3 lists the detailed comparisons of 
pseudoMap with other previous databases related to 
pseudogenes. </p>

8 Second, random assignment enabled rigorous measurement of 
the program's impacts. 
The randomization procedure was designed as follows. First, among the semifi-
nalists, all those with business plan total scores below 30 were dropped, to maintain 
a minimum standard. This reduced the pool from 1,920 to 1,841 firms. Then a 
two-step stratified randomization was conducted by the author in <rs type="software">STATA</rs> to choose 
the ordinary winners: </p>

<p>Quantitative SHAPE reactivity for individual datasets 
obtained with radiolabeled primers was normalized to a 
scale spanning 0-1.5, in which 0 indicates unreactive nucle-
otides and the mean intensity at highly reactive nucleotides 
is set to 1.0 [3]. For each dataset, the intensity of the 
untreated RNA was subtracted from that of the treated 
RNA to obtain the net reactivity. Then, a normalization 
factor was determined by excluding the 2% most-reactive 
peak intensities, followed by calculating the mean for the 
next 8% of peak intensities. Reactivity values were then 
divided by this mean [58]. Data from at least three indepen-
dent assays were used to calculate the SHAPE reactivity 
(mean AE SD). 
SHAPE electropherograms were analyzed using <rs type="software">QUSHAPE</rs> 
software [59]. Quantitative SHAPE reactivities for individ-
ual datasets were normalized to a scale spanning 0-1.5, in 
which 0 indicates an unreactive nucleotide, and the mean 
intensity at highly reactive nucleotides is set to 1.0. 
Hydroxyl radical cleavage intensities were normalized to 
a scale from 0 to 1.5, where 1.0 is defined as the mean 
intensity of highly reactive residues. Nucleotides with reac-
tivity values lower than half the mean reactivity are defined 
as solvent-inaccessible [60]. </p>

<p>The secondary RNA structure was visualized using <rs type="software">VAR-
NA</rs> [61]. <rs type="software">RNAsc</rs>, <rs type="software">RNAstructure</rs> and <rs type="software">SHAPEKNOTS</rs> software 
[49-51] were used to predict the secondary RNA structure 
including SHAPE reactivity values. </p>

<p>Alignment of 180 FMDV IRES nucleotide sequences avail-
able in GenBank was performed using <rs id="software-13" type="software">CLUSTALX</rs> with default 
parameters (<rs corresp="#software-13" type="url">http://www.clustal.org</rs>). Polymorphic positions 
in the region 306-380 were determined relative to the FMDV 
C-S8 isolate (GenBank accession number AF274010.1). The 
sequence logo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu) was generated 
from alignment of the 180 IRES sequences. The overall </p>

Preparation of cells: Collection of PBMOs and induction 
of DCs were performed as described previously [19]. In 
brief, PB was collected from dogs in anestrus. CD14 + PB-
MOs were isolated from PB mononuclear cells using anti-
human CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Begisch-
Gladbach, Germany). To induce differentiation to DCs, the 
isolated PBMOs (1 × 10 6 /ml) were cultured in wells of 24 
well-culture plates (Asahi Techno Glass, Shizuoka, Japan) 
with 2 ml culture medium which was composed of 1.5 ml 
PRMI1640 supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
(10%) and 0.5 ml TCCM. The cultures were incubated at 
37°C with various concentrations of ovarian hormones. As 
the untreated control, vehicle (ethanol) was added to the cul-
ture. Cells were harvested on day 6 or day 12 to investigate 
either immature or mature DCs. Thus, the early 6 days in the 
culture were considered as the differentiation period, and the 
late 6 days, as the maturation period. 
Reverse transcription (RT) -PCR: Total RNA was from 
PBMOs (1 × 10 6 ), immature DCs (1 × 10 6 ) or ovarian cells 
as a positive control. The RT reaction and the PCR for 
estrogen receptor (ER) α, ERβ and a housekeeping gene 
18s rRNA was performed as previously described [6]. To 
perform the PCR for progesterone receptor (PR), using 
<rs type="software">Primer3</rs> software [13], we designed primers as follows: 
sense, 5′-CAGGTGTACCAGCCGTACCT-3′; antisense, 
5′-ACAGGTTGTGGGAGAGCAAC-3′. 
Flow cytometry: Flow cytometry (FCM) was performed 
as described previously [17, 20]. Cells harvested from the 
cultures were stained with the following monoclonal anti-
bodies (mAbs): FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD1a 
mAb (clone NA1/34-HLK, Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), rat 
anti-canine MHC class II mAb (clone YKIX.334.2, Serotec), 
PE-Cy5-conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 mAb (clone 
TÜK4, Serotec), biotin conjugated rat anti-mouse CD80 
mAb (clone 1G10, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, 
U.S.A.) and mouse anti-human CD86 mAb (clone FUN-1, 
Becton Dickinson). Staining with biotin conjugated mAb 
was followed by incubation with streptavidin-PerCP-Cy5.5 
(Becton Dickinson). Before staining, the anti-CD86 mAb 
was labeled by PE conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Mo-
lecular Probe) for 5 min at room temperature. The excess 
of PE-goat anti-mouse IgG was neutralized by excess puri-
fied mouse IgG (Sigma). After the staining, the cells were 
fixed and analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur™: 
Becton Dickinson). Background of the fluorescence was 
adjusted using following isotype-control: FITC-conjugated 
mouse IgG2a (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.), FITC-
conjugated rat IgG2a (eBioscience) and biotin-conjugated 
rat IgG2a (eBioscience). To determine the expression 
intensity of the surface antigens specified above, the mean 
peak channel of the fluorescence intensity was calculated by 
software (CellQuest™: Becton Dickinson) after the FCM 
analysis and expressed as mean expression intensity (MEI). 
Mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR): MLR was carried out 
as described previously [19]. In outline, PBMOs were in-
cubated in the cultures for DC-induction with progesterone, 
17-OHP or estrogen for 12 days. After the incubation, cells </p>

<p>in graded doses were cultured with allogeneic PB mono-
nuclear cells (10 5 ) in 0.2 ml RPMI 1640 supplemented with 
10% FBS for 4 days. Cell proliferation was quantified by 
incubation of the cells with [ 3 H]-thymidine (PerkinElmer ® 
Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA, U.S.A.). 
Statistical analysis: Experimental groups were compared 
using analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected 
least significant difference (PLSD), implemented using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Stat-
View</rs> ® software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Hulinks Inc</rs>., Tokyo, Japan). To compare two 
parameters against each other, Student's t test was used. The 
significance level was set at P&lt;0.05. </p>

<p>ated sequence and block randomization protocol. Demo-
graphic and basic characteristics such as age, height, 
gender, weight, body mass index (BMI), and history of 
any medical condition were recorded before administra-
tion of study drugs. Then a nurse, who was blinded to the 
study, mixed both of the medications with 5 mL of sugar 
syrup to make it palatable. The parents gave the pre-
pared syrup to the children under the researchers' su-
pervision. Pulse rate and oxygen saturation (SaO2) were 
continuously monitored by a portable pulse oximeter. 
Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and SaO2 
were recorded at baseline (just before drug administra-
tion) and every 30 minutes until the patient was dis-
charged from the radiology department. The level of se-
dation of patients after drug administration was as-
sessed using Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) (16). RSS of 
four was considered as adequate sedation depth to tol-
erate diagnostic imaging studies. Patients who did not 
show satisfactory response to the sedative drugs within 
40 minutes and those who were awakened or moved 
during the imaging were excluded from further analysis. 
The interval between administration of sedative drugs 
and achieving RSS of four was considered as the time to 
achieve adequate sedation. Once the patients achieved 
adequate sedation, they were transferred to a scanner 
room and the imaging was performed according to the 
protocol. After the scan, the patients were transferred to 
another room in the radiology department to monitor 
and observe their conditions. The time to discharge from 
radiology department was defined as the interval be-
tween the start of sedative administration and return to 
the baseline alertness and spontaneous breathing. 
Statistical analyses 
All statistical analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">19.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). The categorical data 
were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Parametric data 
were analyzed using the student's t-test. Descriptive sta-
tistics were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or 
number (percentage). Statistical significance was set at 
p &lt; 0.05. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare changes 
of vital signs during 180 minutes after drug administra-
tion between two groups. 
Results: 
66 participants were enrolled. Figure 1 shows the CON-
SORT flow diagram of study. The mean age of partici-
pants was 2.8 ± 1.6 years (range: 6 months to 6 years) 
and 54.5% of the participants were male. Table 1 shows 
the basic characteristics of patients. There was no signif-
icant difference between the two groups in age, height, 
weight, and male to female ratio (Table 1). Table 2 com-
pares outcomes between two groups. Adequate sedation 
(RSS of 4) was achieved in five patients (15.2%) in the 
OM group and 15 patients (45.5%) in the OMK group, 
which showed a statistically significant difference (p =

<p>Mouse hearts were quickly dissected and washed in cold PBS. After 
removal of the atria, ventricles were lysed in a Precellys ceramic lys-
ing kit tube with 1 ml RIPA buffer by two 30-s cycles at 5,000 rpm 
in PRECELLYS 24 (Bertin Technologies). Ventricle or adult cardio-
myocyte lysates (see the Adult mouse cardiomyocyte isolation sec-
tion) were then incubated with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads 
in RIPA buffer for 4 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with 
RIPA buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 
5 min before loading in 4-12% NuPAGE (Life Technologies) precast 
gels for Western analysis. For the analysis of CamKII, PLB, and Tro-
ponin I, hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus as described 
in the Langendorff heart preparation section with a modified Krebs 
solution with or without 20 ng/ml BDNF (PeproTech) or 5 µM For-
skolin (Sigma-Aldrich) used as a positive control. Heart contractility 
was monitored during the perfusion process and at the peak of cardiac 
pressure induced by BDNF or Forskolin the hearts were snap frozen 
with stainless steel clamps cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored fro-
zen before homogenization in RIPA buffer supplemented with prote-
ases (complete mini; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP; 
Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4°C and 
the supernatants were diluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and 
loaded in a gel for Western analysis. Membranes (PVDF; Life Tech-
nologies) were blocked in 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA in TBS-Tween 
before incubation with a specific antibody. Antibodies were as follows: 
anti-TrkB (against the extracellular domain of TrkB and therefore rec-
ognizing all TrkB isoforms; EMD Millipore), anti-TrkB.T1 (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-GAPDH (EMD Millipore), anti-CaV 
1.2a1c (L-Type calcium channel subunit a1c,; Alomone Lab), anti-HA 
(for Western, Covance; for immunoprecipitation, Sigma-Aldrich), 
anti-Phospho-TrkB raised against phosphorylated TrkB-Tyr516 (Cell 
Signaling Technology), anti-total CAMKII (Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy), anti-CAMKII P-T286/T287 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-
total Phospholamban (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Phospholamban 
P-S16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Phospholamban P-T17 
(Badrilla), and anti-total and P-Ser 23/24 Troponin I (Cell Signaling 
Technology). After incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibody, membranes were incubated with ECL substrate for 
detection of HRP enzyme activity (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visu-
alized in a Syngene gel documentation system. Images were splined 
(Arganda-Carreras et al., 2006) as needed and quantified by <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageJ</rs> 
analysis (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>). Student's t test was used for 
statistical significance assessment. </p>

<p>Male mice (2 mo, 19-25 g) were injected with heparin (5,000 U/kg 
i.p.) and after 10 min were anesthetized with Avertin (150 mg/kg i.p.). 
Hearts were quickly removed from the chest and put into 16-18°C 
calcium-free modified Krebs solution containing 118 mmol NaCl, 23 
mmol NaHCO 3 , 3.2 mmol KCl, 1.2 mmol KH 2 PO 4 , 1.2 mmol MgSO 4 , 
11 mmol glucose, and 2 mmol sodium pyruvate before being mounted 
in a Langendorff perfusion system (Broadley, 1979). Hearts were per-
fused with modified Krebs solution containing 1.5 mM CaCl 2 (37.5°C) 
via the aorta. All solutions were bubbled with 95% O 2 -5% CO 2 , pH 
7.40, and kept at 37°C. An inflatable water-filled balloon was inserted 
into the left ventricle via a small incision in the left atrium for measure-
ment of the left ventricle pressure (BIOPAC Systems Inc.). Perfusion 
pressure and coronary flow were also continuously monitored via a dif-
ferential pressure transducer. All channels were fed to a digidata 1322a 
(Axon) for digitalization storage and analysis using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Igor</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">4.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Wave-Metrics</rs>) or <rs id="software-2" type="software">Clampfit</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Axon</rs>) software. 
After mounting, the hearts were equilibrated for 10 min at a per-
fusion pressure of 80 mmHg and at an end-diastolic pressure of 5-10 </p>

<p>Calcium tolerant adult cardiomyocytes were loaded with Indo1-AM for 
1 h, washed with control solution, and left at room temperature for at 
least 45 min to allow deesterification of the dye. Loading solution was 
prepared from a control solution containing 0.2 mM Ca 2+ and 1 mM 
Indo1-AM (1 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide; Life Technologies) dis-
solved first in Pluronic surfactant (PowerLoad 100×; Life Technology) 
with 1 mg/ml BSA. Cardiomyocytes were field stimulated (0.5/s) with 
platinum electrodes (FHC Inc.) and recordings were made at 27°C 
in 1 mM Ca 2+ solution. BDNF was applied at 50 ng/ml using a pi-
cospritzer at 30 hPa and a glass pipette with 1-M Ohm tip resistance. 
Excited at 340 nM, indo1-AM emission was split into two channels and 
passed through 405/10-nm (calcium-bound emission) and 488/10-nm 
(calcium-free emission) fluorescence filters. Light collected by photo-
diodes (Till Photonics) was digitally converted at 10 KHz (<rs id="software-3" type="software">pClamp</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">10</rs> 
and Digidata 1322a) and computed and the information was stored. </p>

filter and digitized at 5 kHz) with a Multiclamp 700B (Axon) using 
<rs id="software-5" type="software">pClamp</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Axon</rs>). The maximum absolute value of the current 
obtained (in pA) was divided by the cell capacitance (in pF). </p>

<p><rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v9.1.3</rs> software was used for data analysis. Results 
were presented as means±SD. The significance of differ-
ences between groups were analyzed by the Dunnett's t-test 
and the student's t-test. Statistical significance was set at 
p＜0.05. 
The bootstrapping method was repeated 1000 times to 
estimate the 95% confidence interval of the ratio of each 
NEI index between the groups. If 95% confidence interval 
of the ratio is lower or higher than 1, this indicates that 
the expression of the index in the test group is significantly 
lower or higher than that in the control group. 
The NEI network data with 19 indices can be simplified 
by principal component analysis (PCA) [13,14], which can 
transform a large number of indices into only two or three 
latent variables known as principal components. Thus, the 
high dimension information can be visualized as a scatter 
plot, in which each data point represents one rat sample, 
and the distance between points in the score plot is an in-
dication of the similarity between samples. In addition, 
loading plots from PCA were used to rank the importance 
of each variable to further capture the differentially ex-
pressed indices accountable for the separation between </p>

<p>carcasses from farms to processing plants in continental Spain. The location of intermediate (circles) and processing (triangles) plants is shown in (a), 
and vulture breeding sites are shown in (b). Legend values represent the number of breeding pairs. Maps were generated with <rs id="software-2" type="software">ArcGIS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">10.1</rs>. </p>

<p>Carcass transport. We simulated the movement of carcasses from farms to 
processing plants directly or indirectly, through intermediate plants, following the 
scheme shown in the Fig. 1. We estimated the distance travelled by carcasses using the 
main national paved road network and the network analysis extension in <rs id="software-0" type="software">ArcGIS</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">10.1</rs>. As the location of each farm was not available, we considered the center of each 
10 3 10 km grid to be the point of origin (i.e., the farm) from which carcasses were 
moved. From these points, we calculated the distance travelled by trucks to the nearest 
plant. If this plant was a processing plant, then carcass movement was considered 
complete. If this plant was an intermediate plant, another truck was used to complete </p>

<p>, we also 
calculated their richness (i.e., number of species) in a 100 km buffer around each 10 3 
10 km grid cell. We used Generalized Linear Models (1/mu 
2 link function and inverse 
Gaussian error distribution) to explore the relationship between metric tons of CO 2 
eq. per grid and distance to the nearest obligate scavenger breeding site. Metric tons of 
CO 2 eq. in a 100 km buffer around grids with different species richness (from 0 to 4) 
were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. All analyses were performed in R 
42 . We 
used <rs id="software-1" type="software">ArcGIS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">10.1</rs> to generate maps. </p>

<p>Tumor histology. Tissues were fixed in formalin and embed-
ded in paraffin. Sections (4 µm) were cut and stained with 
H&amp;E. Representative sections of liver, heart, and kidney were 
scanned with a Scanscope CS slide scanner (Aperio Tech-
nologies, Vista, CA), visualized with <rs id="software-10" type="software">ImageScope</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">Aperio Technologies</rs>), and composed in <rs type="software">Adobe Photoshop</rs> 
(San Jose, CA). Images were adjusted in brightness, con-
trast, and color balance for a more uniform appearance of the 
H&amp;E stain. These adjustments do not obscure, eliminate, or 
misrepresent any information presented in the original slides. 
Original objective lens magnification was 20×. All images 
were reviewed by a veterinary pathologist. </p>

<p>The 474 human miRNA hairpin structures available in 
miRBase 9.1 were retrieved and annotated with respect 
to mature sequence location using a <rs type="software">Perl program</rs>. A 
second program parsed these annotated structures to 
extract each class of potentially edited sites. We divided 
494 UAG triplet sites in dsRNA regions of 291 pri-
miRNAs into four groups: W-C group; U and G in UAG 
triplet form Watson-Crick base pairing (201 sites in 157 
pri-miRNAs). G-U group; Either U or G, or both in UAG 
triplet forms G-U wobble base pairing (122 sites in 105 pri-
miRNAs). Mismatch group; Either U or G in UAG triplet 
forms mismatch base pairing (90 sites in 79 pri-miRNAs). 
Others group; Both U and G in UAG triplet form </p>

<p>the patient's tracheal tube was thereafter suctioned using a 
suction tube with a caliber ≤ 1/3 the caliber of the patient's 
tracheal tube. Then, the tracheal tube cuff was evacuated and 
patient was asked to take a deep breath. In the climax of the 
inspiration, the patient was extubated. 
In the new method, the patient's mouth was suctioned dry 
(without liquid). Then, only if it was necessary, intra-tracheal 
suction was done. Afterward and before evacuating the 
tracheal tube cuff, the system's PEEP was set to 15 cmH 2 O 
and PSV to 20 cmH 2 O. Next, immediately after evacuating 
the cuff with a syringe, the patient's mouth and pharynx 
were suctioned cautiously. And finally, the tracheal tube was 
removed along its curve. 
Extubation in both methods was done by trained nurses. 
If there was secretion in the pharynx, it was suctioned again 
and the patient was encouraged to cough or swallow the 
secretion and to breathe deeply. The patient was set in a 
semi-sitting posture (30-45 degrees) and oxygenation was 
done with nasal oxygen, and if necessary, by using a face 
mask with an oxygen reservoir bag. 
Based on ethical rules, in the fifth and sixth time periods, 
ABG analysis (as an invasive procedure) was conducted in 
accordance with the rules of our ICU or the clinical judgment 
of the anesthesiologist. 
The results are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) 
for the quantitative variables and are summarized by absolute 
frequencies and percentages for the categorical variables. 
Differences in the distribution of the characteristics in the 
patients were examined using the chi-square test for the 
discrete variables, while the t-test was employed to examine 
differences between the two groups for the continuous 
variables. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to 
eliminate the effect of the confounders. For the statistical 
analyses, the statistical software <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 16.0 for Windows</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL) and the statistical 
package <rs id="software-1" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 9.1 for windows</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., 
Cary, NC, USA) were used. </p>

<p>at four hours after extubation, there was no requirement to 
the reservoir mask in the case group but 8 patients in the 
control group required the usage of the reservoir mask; as 
a result, breathing via the nasal cannula seemed appropriate 
for providing proper oxygenation in the case group. The 
percentages of the patients with Po 2 / Fio 2 &lt; 200 (PaO 2 / FiO 2 
less than 200) at one and four hours after extubation were 
smaller in the case group than in the control group, but their 
differences were not significant (Table 4). 
At one hour after extubation, 7 (4.6%) patients in the 
control group showed PO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 150, whereas none of the 
patients in the case group developed this complication; their 
difference was significant. Also, in the control group, at four 
and twelve hours after extubation, 9 and 10 patients showed 
PO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 150 (PaO 2 / FiO 2 less than 150), respectively, 
while no patient experienced a similar situation in the new 
method group. At forty-eight hours after extubation, in the 
open method group, 8 patients (of 20), who required ABG, 
had respiratory parameters within the range of PO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 
150. In contrast, no patient required ABG forty-eight hours 
after extubation in the other group (Table 5). 
As is mentioned in the results, variables that might 
affect the findings were regarded as confounding variables. 
Considering the variables of age, gender, BMI, EF, 
intubation time, FEV 1 / FVC, and PaO 2 / FiO 2 in the "logistic 
regression" test demonstrated that the new method decreased 
the extubation complications in PaO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 225 at one 
and four hours after extubation, and PO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 200 at one, 
four, and twelve hours after extubation. However, only the 
difference in PaO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 225 at four hours after extubation 
was statistically significant between the two groups (Table 
6). 
Additionally, the multivariable linear regression test, <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">16</rs>, showed a higher range of PaO 2 / FiO 2 at one hour after 
extubation and PaO 2 / FiO 2 at four hours after extubation 
in the patients with the new extubation method than that in 
those with the conventional extubation method (8.888 mmHg 
and 8.248 mmHg, respectively); there were, however, no 
significant differences. </p>

<p>forty-eight hours after extubation. Given the high rate of 
mortality and morbidity in such patients, these percentages 
should be regarded as a very important clinical parameter to 
compare the two groups and to introduce the new method as 
an effective and safe extubation method. 
Considering confounding variables in the logistic 
regression test using <rs id="software-3" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">9.1</rs> software, we found that in 
almost all the time periods, PaO 2 / FiO 2 was higher in the 
new extubation method group; however, only PaO 2 / FiO 2 
four hours after extubation &lt; 225 between the two groups 
was statistically significant (Table 6). 
These findings suggest that our new method of extubation 
enjoys an acceptable oxygenation profile after CABG by 
comparison with the conventional method. 
One of the most important restrictions in this study was 
ethical limitations in redundant blood sampling for ABG. 
When the patients were discharged from the ICU, their 
catheters were off, usually. Therefore, afterward, blood 
sampling for ABG was limited for the patients who required 
it based on medical indications. In addition, after extubating 
and weaning the patients from the respiratory machine, FiO 2 
was estimated based on the nasal mask or the reservoir mask, 
40% or 80%, respectively. 
We believe that accurate monitoring of all patients with 
PO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 200 and PO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 300, at least for forty-eight 
hours after extubation (when atelectasia, pneumonia, or the 
other extubation complications may have appeared), could 
indicate the differences between the two methods. </p>

K b values of antagonists for inhibition of agonist action 
were calculated according to Lazareno and Birdsall calculation: 
K b = IC 50 /{1 + [(agonist)/EC 50 ]} (Lazareno and Birdsall, 1993), 
where [agonist] is the concentration of TFLLR-NH 2 in the test 
(Lazareno and Birdsall, 1993). Values given are from at least

P &lt; 0.05 were considered to show significant differences 
between means. The data and statistical analysis comply with

(EMKA Technologies) were used. Weighing signals were 
converted through an analogue-to-digital IT50 converter 
(EMKA Technologies). For telemetric, cystometric and

customized metabolic cages (Technilab). </p>

<p>Samples were taken from cells grown in YPD, and extracts 
were prepared as described previously (31). Proteins were 
separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot. 
Antibodies against H3K4me1 (Ab8895), H3K4me2 
(Ab7766), H3K4me3 (Ab8580), H3K79me3 (Ab2621) 
and the C-terminus of H3 (Ab1791) were obtained from 
Abcam. H3K36me2 (#07-369) and H3K79me2 (#07-366) 
antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. TBP anti-
serum was a kind gift from P.A. Weil. Antibodies H5 and 
H14 were used to detect the serine 2, serine 5 phosphory-
lated forms of the CTD of RNA pol II. The CTD-specific 
antibody 8WG16 was used to detect RNA pol II. TAP-
tagged proteins were detected using IgG-peroxidase 
conjugates. Antibodies against the HA-tag (12CA5 and 
3F10) or the FLAG-tag (M2, sigma) were used to detect 
Ctr9-HA, Bur1-HA, Bur2-HA and FLAG-H2B, respec-
tively. Immunoblots in Figure 2B were quantified using 
<rs type="software">ImageQuant</rs> software and represented as fraction of WT 
after normalization on total H3 levels. </p>

<p>In-gel proteolytic digestion of Coomassie-stained bands 
was performed essentially as described (34), using trypsin 
(Roche). Samples were subjected to nanoflow liquid (LC) 
chromatography (Agilent 1100 series) and concentrated 
on a C18 precolumn (100 mm ID, 2 cm). Peptides were 
separated on an analytical column (75 mM ID, 20 cm) at a 
flow rate of 200 nl/min with a 60 min linear acetonitrile 
gradient from 0 to 80%. The LC system was directly 
coupled to a QTOF Micro tandem mass spectrometer 
(Micromass Waters, UK). A survey scan was performed 
from 400 to 1200 a.m.u./s and precursor ions were 
sequenced in MS/MS mode at a threshold of 150 counts. 
Data were processed and subjected to database searches 
using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Proteinlynx Global Server</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 2.1</rs> (Micromass,

SWISSPROT and the NCBI non-redundant database, 
with a 0.25-Da mass tolerance for both precursor ion and

manual interpretation of the spectra. </p>

regulation of the Set1p complex. (A) mRNA levels of Set1p complex 
components. RNA was extracted from exponentially growing BY4741 
and not4D and subjected to northern blot analysis using the indicated 
probes. (B) Subunit composition of purified Set1p complexes. Strains 
containing or lacking NOT4 and expressing a TAP-tagged Bre2p were 
used to purify Set1p complexes (upper panel). Equal expression of 
Bre2-TAP proteins was checked by western blot analysis (lower panel). 
The indicated proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS. Several 
additional proteins were present in the not4D purification when com-
pared to the WT. Mass spectrometry showed that these bands 
contained non-related lysosomal proteins. We consider this an artifact 
of the purification, likely caused by differences in the concentration of 
the lysates of the WT and not4D cells. (C) Histone methyl transferase 
assay using purified Set1p complexes. Increasing amounts of Set1p 
complex or a mock-purification control were use to methylate soluble 
histones (from calf thymus) in vitro. Samples were separated on a 15% 
SDS-PAA gel, stained with Coomassie, dried and exposed to an X-ray 
film. (D) In vitro methylation of synthetic pre-methylated histone H3-
tail peptides. Pre-methylated peptides were used as substrates for in 
vitro methylation using Set1p complexes purified from WT or not4D 
cells. Samples were separated on a 20% SDS-PAA gel, dried and 
exposed to an X-ray film. Signals were quantified using <rs type="software">ImageQuant</rs> 
software and represented as arbitrary units after background correction. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
tests was used to compare variables. All continuous variables 
are shown as the mean -standard deviation except for ANCOVA 
analysis (mean -standard error). To compare the relationship 
among HbA1c, GA and other variables, Pearson's correlation 
coefficients were used to assess the associations between clinical 
and laboratory variables. We analyzed the differences in the 
correlated coefficients between PCGR or HOMA-b and glyce-
mic indices using Steiger's Z-test. The receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve of PCGR was shown, and the area 
under the curve (AUC) was calculated for separating each med-
ication group. To determine the optimal cut-off value, the point 
on the ROC curve with maximum Youden index (sensitiv-
ity + specificity -1) was calculated. Statistical analyses were 
carried out using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC,

<p>trochanter [32]. The difference between the pre-operative and post-operative leg length for each patient was calculated 
by each observer and then averaged to provide the final leg length change. An established software program 
(<rs id="software-3" type="software">MATLAB</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Mathworks</rs>, Natick, MA) was used to select radiographic landmarks and scale images. Pre and post-
operative radiographs were corrected for abduction in order to minimize the artifact. </p>

visceral adiposity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. To assess sensitive 
growth periods during female development in which undernutrition has the 
largest effect on later type 2 diabetes risk, we tested for interaction by in-
troducing the cross products of famine exposure and age at famine exposure 
into the model. We evaluated the proportionality of the hazards over time with 
log-minus-log plots. Results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. 
Continuous variables were introduced as such in the different models; for 
categorical variables, we created indicator variables. We performed all sta-

followed by W. confusa AB682449, W. confusa AB596944, W.

A phylogenetic tree, which was constructed with the neighbor-
joining method by using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analy-
sis (<rs id="software-1" type="software">MEGA</rs>) software <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 5.05</rs> [11], revealed this isolate to be 
W. confusa (Fig. 3). 
Empirical therapy with ceftriaxone was initiated after blood 
culture submission. In spite of the treatment, fever persisted for 
3 days and the C-reactive protein level did not decrease. The 
ceftriaxone treatment was changed to teicoplanin plus piperacil-
lin-tazobactam after isolation of gram-positive coccobacilli from 
the blood culture. Fever and other symptoms subsided with the 
new regimen. All subsequent blood cultures were negative, and 
the patient was discharged on the 9th hospital day with an un-
eventful recovery. 
On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Leuco-
nostoc paramesenteroides and related species among the cata-
lase-negative, vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive cocci were 
reclassified into a new genus, Weissella, in 1993 [12]. There are 
16 species in the Weissella genus, but only W. confusa (previ-
ously Lactobacillus confusus) and W. cibaria have been isolated </p>

<p>various combinations. These search words were entered 
into PubMed and <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> to locate all relevant 
studies. A convenience sample of women with BC 
(volunteers) was recruited between January 2013 and 
March 2013 from King Abdulaziz University's (KAU) 
Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi Breast Cancer 
Center of Excellence in Jeddah, KSA. Consecutive 
women presenting to the outpatient clinic for initial 
assessment or follow-up were approached for inclusion 
in the study. The inclusion criteria were: age 18 to 65 
years; diagnosis of BC documented in the medical 
record; currently married; and attending the clinic 
on the day that the interviewers were present in the 
clinic. The exclusion criteria were women without BC, 
those outside the age range above, those who were not 
currently married, and all those being seen on days and 
times when interviewers were not present. The average 
length of time that participants were diagnosed with 
and/or experienced symptoms of BC were 38.4 months 
(range 2 weeks to 180 months). The questionnaire 
was translated into Arabic, and was self-completed 
by participants. Medical students (trained by KAU 
psychiatry faculty on how to approach patients, obtain 
consent, and administer the questionnaire) explained 
the study to the participants and obtained informed 
consent before proceeding. The institutional review 
board of KAU Hospital approved the study following 
the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. 
Questionnaire. Participants were asked regarding 
their age (27-65 years), nationality/citizenship (Saudi=1 
versus immigrant=0), education level (none=1, primary 
school only=2, high school only=3, university=4, post-
graduate=5), employment status (yes=1 versus no=0), 
and family income per month (&lt;3,000 Saudi Arabian 
Riyals (SAR)=1; 3,000 to 5,000=2; &gt;5,000=3). Also 
assessed were duration of illness in months (0.5-180) 
and type of treatment received (radiation therapy, 
chemotherapy, surgery). 
Anxiety. The HADS 
16 is a self-rated scale commonly 
used to measure anxiety and depressive symptoms in 
outpatient medical populations including those in the 
Middle East. 
30,31,32 Scores of 0-7 are considered normal, 
8-10 signify "possible" anxiety disorder, and 11-21 
indicate "probable" anxiety disorder (range 0-21). The 
Cronbach's alpha for anxiety subscale (HADS-A) is 
reported to be high (0.85). 
40 The reliability and validity 
of HADS in Arabic has been previously established. 
41 In 
the current study, HADS-A subscale's alpha was 0.78 
(standardized), which is above the recommended 
threshold of 0.70. </p>

<p>Scale (SPS) is a self-rated 12-item measure of emotional 
support and emotional strain in the relationship with 
a spouse. 
43 In the present study, we administered the 
6-item emotional support subscale where each item is 
rated from one (not at all) to 4 (a lot), with a score 
range from 6-24 (higher scores indicating greater 
perceived spousal support). The average score in the 
original validation study was approximately 20. 
43 The 
Cronbach's alpha of the scale is reported to be 0.91. 
44 In 
the present study, the internal reliability was similarly 
high (alpha=0.85). The second scale administered was 
the Quality of Marriage Index (QMI). 
45 The QMI is 
a 6-item self-rated scale that assesses the "essential 
goodness of a relationship." Each item is rated on a scale 
from one (very strong disagreement) to 7 (very strong 
agreement) with a theoretical score range of 7-42 (higher 
scores indicating a more positive marital relationship). 
Average scores have been reported to range from 28-37, 
with higher scores in men. 
46-48 Internal reliability of the 
QMI ranges from 0.91-0.97. 
44 The alpha in the present 
sample was 0.89. For inclusion in multivariate analyses, 
the SPS and QMI were combined to form a 12-item 
scale that ranged from 6-66 (alpha=0.91). Although the 
psychometric properties of the Arabic versions of the 
above 2 scales have not been established, we chose these 
measures based on their "content" validity; as noted 
above, both scales' reliability in the present sample was 
acceptable. 
Statistical analyses. The characteristics of the 
sample were described by means + standard deviations 
(SD) or percentages (Table 1). A correlation matrix 
(Pearson r) was constructed for all study variables (Table 2). 
In multivariate analyses, income was dichotomized 
into low (&lt;3,000=0) versus high (&gt;3,000=1), and 
education was dichotomized into low (0=no education 
or only primary school) versus high (one=high school or 
beyond). Blocks of independent variables were entered 
in a stepwise fashion into 3 general linear models 
predicting the dependent variable (anxiety symptoms): 
model one included only the sample demographics 
(age, nationality, education, employment, income); 
model 2 included demographics and cancer-related 
factors; and model 3 included demographics, cancer-
related factors, and overall MQ (Table 3). Given the 
sample size, only independent variables significant at 
p&lt;0.10 were carried forward into later models. Since 
these analyses were largely exploratory, the significance 
level was set at p=0.05, and analyses were not adjusted 
for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed 
using the <rs id="software-2" type="software">Statistical Analysis System</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., Cary, North Carolina, USA). </p>

<p>than this length cannot be expected to fold back and form a sec-
ondary structure of biological relevance. RNA chains shorter than 
10 nucleotides usually form double helix pairing with their com-
plimentary strands, and do not form a secondary structure on 
their own. 
A total of 2095 RNA structure entries were reported by the 
PDB search engine in July, 2011. We have developed a software in 
<rs type="software">GNU-Octave</rs>, which is similar to <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> scripting language, that </p>

<p>The database can be searched for a set of RNA structural entries 
according to functional type or source organism. Also, a combined 
search can be performed using advanced options where a user can 
specify the chain length as well as a resolution cutoff of the crystal 
structures. Furthermore, one can determine if there are any struc-
tures whose sequence is identical to a given nucleotide sequence. 
At present, only scientific names of the organisms are accepted for 
search criteria in "Advanced Search Options" of our web-server. 
As the classification shows, there are many RNA classes where 
the numbers of PDB files are 10 or greater. These subclasses 
have been shown in Table 3 and corresponding MOL_ID's are 
shown as a suffix to the PDB-ID. They carry signatures that 
may indicate variations introduced in the molecular structure 
due to ligand binding or alteration of crystallization conditions. 
Eventually, they can be referred to as crystallographic ensem-
bles in analogy with statistical ensembles obtained from mol-
ecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations as done recently 
(Halder and Bhattacharyya, 2010; Samanta et al., 2010). We have 
performed pair-wise secondary structure comparison for these 
classes to compare the structural similarity between them. For 
secondary structure assignment, the base pairing patterns of 
each RNA structure in a functional class have been obtained 
using <rs id="software-5" type="software">BPFind</rs> software tool (Das et al., <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-date">2006</rs>). <rs type="software">BPFind</rs> gives 
us the secondary structure of a nucleic acid at the basepair-
ing level. These secondary structural information of basepairing 
for each chain have been converted to a one-dimensional string 
of characters: H, N, T, and L corresponding to Watson-Crick 
base pairs, non-canonical base pairs, base triplets, and unpaired </p>

<p>bases, respectively. The secondary structures thus obtained corre-
spond to individual RNA chains separately and do not consider 
inter-chain base pairing information. These secondary structural 
sequences are then compared with that of the best representa-
tive structure of that class using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm 
(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) as implemented in <rs id="software-7" type="software">EMBOSS</rs> 
(Rice et al., <rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-date">2000</rs>). An identity scoring matrix (EDNAMAT) was 
used for such alignment with a gap-open penalty of −10.0 and 
gap-extension penalty of -0.5. We find that the average simi-
larity is 80% or more for a set of similar structures of a given </p>

<p>resolution better than 3.5Å. For the secondary structure align-
ment, the basepairing pattern for each RNA structure in the 
non-redundant dataset, obtained using <rs type="software">BPFind</rs> software, com-
prises a database of known structural forms of well-classified 
functional RNAs. In a similar way, the secondary structural 
data for each of the unannotated RNA chains were generated 
and compared against the database of known structural forms. 
Thus, the secondary structural information of an unannotated 
RNA chain has been aligned with secondary structural informa-
tion of each RNA chain present in the non-redundant dataset 
using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence align-
ment. We have assigned probable function of an unannotated 
RNA as identical to some known structural form with which the 
best similarity score is obtained. For example, chain A of 1FIR 
shows highest score of 362 against chain A of 1EVV (Table 4). </p>

<p>red-free DMEM medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS in an opaque (for 
Rluc assay) or a clear (for cytotoxicity assay) 96-well plate (Corning). 
At incubating the cells at 37°C for 16 h, medium was replaced with 
fresh phenol red-free medium containing 2% FBS. The reason for using 
2% FBS phenol red-free medium (rather than 10% FBS medium) is to 
minimize protein binding of compounds. Compounds NITD-008 (a gift 
from Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases) with 10-fold serial dilu-
tions were added to cells. Cells were also treated with 0.9% DMSO as a 
negative control. After 48 h of treatment at 37°C, cells were assayed 
for Rluc activity using ViviRen substrates (Promega) or cell viability 
using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Sigma) as previously described (Xie 
et al., 2011). The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) and 50% cytotoxic-
ity concentration (CC 50 ) were estimated by using a four-parameter lo-
gistic regression model from the <rs id="software-1" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">GraphPad Software Inc.</rs>., San Diego CA). For the antiviral screening 
assay, we chose ViviRen substrate, rather than Renilla lysis buffer/sub-
strate (as described for transient replicon assay), to improve the assay 
throughput. This is because ViviRen substrate is able to penetrate into 
cells, thus eliminating the step of cell lysis during antiviral screening. </p>

<p>against other host permissive plasmids (9). In addition, 
chromosomally encoded TA pairs have also been shown 
or postulated to play multiple other functions. These 
systems can act to stabilize large horizontally acquired 
chromosomal regions, such as integrons, by selecting 
against their loss (10). TA pairs also provide immunity 
to the host cell from the same or related toxin encoded 
on other co-resident mobile genetic elements, thus acting 
as anti-addiction modules by allowing for the loss of one 
or more 'redundant' anti-toxin gene and its carrier mobile 
genetic element (2,11). A major area of active research in 
the TA field relates to a postulated regulatory role in bac-
terial stress physiology and the formation of dormant or 
'persister' cells. Persister cells are involved in antibiotic 
resistance and pathogenicity in Mycobacterium tubercu-
losis and several other important human pathogens 
(2,12). In Escherichia coli, persister cells can be formed 
by fluctuations in the expression of the HipA toxin, 
encoded by the hipBA TA tandem genes (13,14). 
Expression of HipA over a certain threshold in small 
numbers of cells causes dormancy (14). This subset of 
dormant cells is able to survive antibiotics that are 
active against growing cells, thus allowing the infecting 
organism to survive an antimicrobial assault and regener-
ate in time from a small number of surviving persister 
cells. Thus TA systems may well contribute towards sto-
chastic variation within the population, gearing up indi-
vidual subsets of organisms distinctly to favor survival of 
the population itself in the face of a likely wide diversity of 
unpredictable environmental, competitive and hostile 
challenges ahead. 
Given the dramatic pace of expansion in experimental 
and bioinformatics data pertaining to TA systems in the 
last 10 years and the likely impending avalanche triggered 
by next-generation sequencing-facilitated prokaryotic-
and metagenomic-sequencing projects, we have created a 
<rs type="software">PostgreSQL</rs> database of Type 2 TA systems, known as 
TADB (http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/), that 
provides for ready access, analysis, manipulation and ex-
ploitation of this invaluable biological information. We 
propose that TADB should serve as a 'one-stop-shop' 
for all Type 2 TA data sets and resources and are confi-
dent that in time it will facilitate efficient, 
multi-disciplinary and innovative exploration of the 
bacteria and archaea TA space, further defining presently 
recognized phenomena and potentially even leading to 
yet-to-be envisaged frontiers. </p>

<p>As of 30 July 2010, TADB contains 10 753 type 2 TA gene 
pairs identified within 1240 genome sequences represen-
tative of 962 strains of phylogenetically diverse bacteria 
and archaea. The data in TADB are derived from compu-
tationally predicted data sets and/or reports of experimen-
tally validated TA genes. The <rs type="software">BLASTP</rs>-identified 921 TA 
loci present in 147 sequenced genomes reported by Gerdes 
and co-workers (3,7) were first uploaded and classified 
into eight TA families. Next, the 5806 TA loci found in 
604 genomes which had been assigned to 44 conserved TA </p>

<p>domain pairs by Makarova et al. (4) were archived in 
TADB. The database was then further complemented 
with the data set of <rs type="software">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> predicted TA 
loci identified in 883 annotated genomes. The <rs type="software">RASTA-
Bacteria</rs> algorithm utilizes <rs type="software">RPSBLAST</rs> search and 
typical characteristics of TA loci, such as a two-gene, 
co-directed module coding for small proteins, to identify 
TA hits (6). <rs type="software">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> TA pair hits with one score 
&gt;70% and the other &gt;60% were recorded by TADB, this 
strict cut-off yields broadly reliable TA candidates (6). 
Subsequently, the three data sets mentioned above were 
compared to ensure that only de-duplicated entries were 
included in TADB; identical TA loci from identical strains 
were eliminated. 
In addition, we have identified further examples of 
known or putative TA loci by searching PubMed using 
the search terms 'toxin AND antitoxin' and manually in-
specting all PubMed hits. Supplementary TA loci 
identified by this literature search strategy included six 
TA pairs, absent from the first three data sets mentioned 
above, in M. tuberculosis H37Rv (NC_000962) that had 
recently been (12). At present, TADB contains details of 
106 experimentally validated TA loci. Significantly, text 
mining has identified a further three TA families and 
three three-component TA families that belong to more 
recently identified TA families that would not be detected 
by the current version of <rs type="software">RASTA-Bacteria</rs>. Our TADB 
database now includes members of 11 two-component 
and 3 three-component TA families. These TA families 
were classified based on toxin protein sequence similarity 
and tertiary structure, as described in the reviews by 
Gerdes et al. (1) and Van Melderen and Saavedra De 
Bast (2) (See http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/ 
Introduction.html for more details). We have also classi-
fied TADB entries by a second classification system based 
on identification of TA pairs sharing cognate TA domains 
and independent of wider protein-level similarity as sug-
gested recently by Makarova et al. (4), yet again offering 
the potential for future enhanced genome data mining and 
further expansion of the TADB database. TADB is 
expected to grow dramatically given next-generation 
sequencing-facilitated rapid acceleration in prokaryote-
focused whole genome sequencing projects. As more in-
formation about the TA loci becomes available, the 
database will be expanded and improved accordingly. 
TADB is implemented as a <rs type="software">PostgreSQL</rs> relational 
database. The ontology-based Chado schema (15) was 
employed to house annotations and sequences of 1000 
prokaryotic genomes which had been downloaded from 
the NCBI Refseq archive (16). A second customized 
schema was designed to organize the available experimen-
tal and in silico analyses data and references relating to TA 
loci reported in the literatures. TADB runs on a <rs type="software">Linux</rs> 
platform with the <rs type="software">Apache</rs> web-server. Web interfaces 
were developed using <rs type="software">HTML</rs>, <rs type="software">CSS</rs> and <rs type="software">JavaScript</rs>. The 
majority of data pipelines were developed with <rs type="software">PHP</rs> and 
<rs type="software">Perl</rs>. In addition, the following freely available compo-
nents were employed: (i) genome browser <rs type="software">Gbrowse</rs> (17); 
(ii) circular genome visualization tool <rs type="software">CGview</rs> (18); 
(iii) multiple sequence alignment and visualization tools, 
<rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> (19) and <rs type="software">Jalview</rs> (20); (iv) primer design tool </p>

<p>Primer3Plus (21); (v) <rs type="software">IslandViewer</rs> (database of genomic 
islands) (22); (vi) dndDB (database of DNA backbone 
phosphorothioation) (23); (vii) ACLAME database 
(A CLAssification of genetic Mobile Elements) (24); 
(viii) GOLD database of genome sequencing projects (25). </p>

<p>At the heart of TADB is the 'Browse by organism' page 
that provides a hyperlinked organized catalog of over 
900 prokaryotic genomes with TA systems identified by 
one of the above-mentioned strategies. TADB allows the 
users to view genomic maps flagged by hyperlinked TA loci 
color-coded by TA family to provide a genome-scale view 
TA locus repertoires. In addition, users can access individ-
ual pages dedicated to each TA locus pair, toxin and 
antitoxin as required. As an example, TA loci in 
Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4 (NCBI Refseq accession no. 
NC_009483) were analysed (Figure 1). Geobacter 
uraniireducens Rf4 is a Gram negative Delta 
Proteobacteria which can reduce uranium using acetate 
and other organic acids (Supplementary Figure S3C). 
Recently G. uraniireducens has been used experimentally 
in bioremediation of metal-contaminated subsurface envir-
onments (26). Tabulated (Figure 1A) and graphically dis-
played (Figure 1B) outputs of the 74 putative TA pairs with 
conserved TA domains (4) in G. uraniireducens Rf4 are as 
shown. In addition, a further eight putative TA loci pre-
dicted by <rs type="software">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> (6) are also included in these 
outputs. The genomic context of a selected TA locus is 
readily investigated further by using <rs type="software">Gbrowse</rs>, as shown 
for the putative TA locus Gura_2469-Gura_2470 (Figure 
1D). The putative toxin protein (yet to be experimentally 
characterized), Gura_2470, contains a MNT (minimal 
nucleotidyltransferase) domain, while its cognate putative 
antitoxin, Gura_2469, harbors a HEPN (higher eukaryotes 
and 
prokaryotes 
nucleotide-binding) 
domain 
(Supplementary Figure S3D) (4). Equivalent domain-level 
data are available for 12 other G. uraniireducens Rf4 
putative TA pairs archived within TADB (Supplementary 
Figure S3). Interestingly, a second putative TA pair 
Gura_2467-Gura_2468 (4) is located a short distance </p>

<p>TADB offers several search tools with varied options. 
Through the 'Search' page, users can retrieve a specific 
object(s) in the TADB database by the following 
categories: species or genus, TA family, gene or protein. 
Via the 'Tools' page, users are able to blast a query 
sequence using <rs id="software-39" type="software">WU-BLAST</rs> <rs corresp="#software-39" type="version-number">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-39" type="creator">W. Gish</rs>, personal com-
munication) against TADB to find and visualize potential 
homologous matches. A NCBI <rs type="software">RPSBLAST</rs> (Reverse 
PSI-BLAST) (30) interface that relies on a position 
specific scoring matrix to identify potential toxin or anti-
toxin domains in a user-supplied protein sequence is also 
provided. </p>

TADB. Hyperlinks to NCBI Refseq Project, UniProtKB, PDB and/or KEGG are provided. An integrated version of <rs type="software">Primer3Plus</rs> (21) is available to 
facilitate design of PCR primers and selected TADB items can be searched against the ACLAME database of mobile genetic elements (24) using 
<rs type="software">Blast</rs> via a single link. (D) A schematic view of the wider genomic context of the putative TA locus Gura_2469-Gura_2470 using <rs type="software">Gbrowse</rs> (17). See 
text for details of the utility TADB-facilitated localized genome browsing strategy as highlighted by the example of the Gura_2469-Gura_2470 locus. </p>

<p>As future developments, we will shortly be updating the 
records of experimentally verified TA loci with more func-
tional information such as details of toxin targets, mech-
anisms of action of antitoxins, promoter, Shine-Dalgarno, 
terminator and identified TA loci regulators. Comparative 
analysis tool will also be incorporated into TADB to fa-
cilitate large scale synteny mapping of chromosomally 
encoded TA loci and their associated genomic islands. 
We are also exploring a pipeline, including the use of 
<rs type="software">RPSBLAST</rs>, to implement automated searches of 
annotated or unannotated genome sequences for presently 
undiscovered potential members of the TADB-recorded 
families. </p>

<p>temperature, using monolithic reversed phase column 
(Chromolith 
® Guard column, RP-18e, 5-4.6 mm; Merck). 
The mobile phase was composed of 100 mM sodium acetate 
(pH 4) acetonitrile (volume ratio of 88:12) and was delivered 
isocratically at a flow rate of 2 mL/minute. 
The HPLC method was validated in terms of specificity, 
linearity, accuracy, precision, and limit of quantification for 
an in vitro assay. Accordingly, the entrapment efficiency (the 
percentage of MTX entrapped to the total amount added) and 
the entrapment capacity (percentage of the entrapped MTX 
to the total amount of loaded system) were calculated. 
The effects of the different factors (pH, feeding ratios, 
and the cross-link ratios) on the loading parameters were 
investigated by full factorial design in three levels (Table 2). 
The factors were analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Design-Expert</rs> 
® Software 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 6.02</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Stat-Ease, Inc.</rs>., Minneapolis, MN, USA). 
The particle sizes and ζ potentials of MTX-loaded 
nano-networks were determined at different cross-link ratios 
(0.0, 0.3, and 0.6) and a constant MTX feed ratio of 0.3, 
according to the section "Remote loading of MTX." </p>

<p>The control experiment was done to study free MTX 
transport through the dialysis membrane at the simulated 
media. To find out the mechanism of drug release from the 
nano-networks, the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation (Equation 
3) was best fitted for the first 60% drug release data in com-
parison to other mathematical equations, including zero order, 
first order, and the Higuchi models. 
55 The release rate (k), the 
release exponent (n), and the lag time (t 0 ) were determined 
from the fraction of MTX released (M/M ∞ ) versus time (t) by 
a nonlinear regression method, using <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">version 16.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">IBM Corporation</rs>, Armonk, NY, USA). </p>

<p>The statistical analysis was performed by <rs id="software-4" type="software">GraphPad</rs> 
Software Inc., <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 5.0</rs> (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, 
CA, USA). P-values 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. Data were expressed as mean ± standard 
deviation. </p>

<p>All the isolated VRE were typed using a high-resolu-
tion biochemical fingerprinting method, Phene plate 
(PhPlate) system, which is specifically developed for typ-
ing of enterococci strains (The PhPlate AB, Stockholm, 
Sweden). Microplates with 11 carbohydrate substrates 
were specifically chosen to differentiate between strains 
of enterococci. Preparation and inoculation of the plates 
were according to the manufacturer instruction. Briefly, 
a loopful of a fresh bacterial culture was inoculated in 
PhPlate growth media containing 0.2% (w/v) protease 
peptone, 0.05% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl and 
0.011% (w/v) bromothymol blue. The plates were then in-
cubated at 37°C and images of the plates were scanned 
after 16, 24 and 48 hours using an HP Scanjet 4890 scan-
ner. After the final scan, the PhPlate software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">PhPWin</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">4.2</rs>) was used to create the absorbance data (biochemi-
cal fingerprint) from the scanned images. The correla-
tion coefficient using a pair-wise comparison of the 
biochemical fingerprints and clustered was determined 
according to the unweighted pair group method (UP-
GMA) with arithmetic averages. The mean similarity 
between the compared isolated minus 2SD was taken as 
the ID-level of the system. Isolates showing similarity to 
each other above this level were considered as identical 
(Common Biochemical Phenotypes: C-BPT) (13). </p>

<p>Total RNA purified from two-independent cultures of DMSO passaged 
control and gefitinib-resistant cultures of HCC4006 cells and HCC827 cells 
was used to prepare cDNA for sequencing with the Illumina Genome 
Analyzer IIx using the Illumina mRNA sequencing preparation kit 
(San Diego, CA, USA). Sequenced reads were mapped against hg19 
using <rs type="software">Tophat</rs> and transcripts were assembled against ensemble reference 
using <rs type="software">Cufflinks</rs>. Expression is reported as fragments per kilobase transcript 
per million reads (FPKM). Data were submitted to applied bias correction 
and quartile normalization. </p>

<p>For measurement of anchorage-independent cell growth, 50 000 cells 
(HCC4006, control or gefitinib resistant) were suspended in 1.5 ml RPMI 
1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.35% Difco agar noble 
(Becton Dickinson and Co., Sparks, MD, USA) and overlaid on base layers 
containing 1.5 ml RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% 
agar noble in six-well plates. The wells were covered with 2 ml growth 
medium containing drugs. This media was replaced with fresh media 
containing drugs every 7 days. The plates were incubated in a 37 1C CO 2 
incubator for 21 days after which viable colonies were stained for 24 h with 
200 ml of 1 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium. Following digital photography, the 
colony number was quantified using the <rs type="software">MetaMorph</rs> imaging software 
program. 
For measurement of proliferation, 10 000 control or gefitinib-resistant 
cells were plated in 500 ml RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 
24-well plates or 20 000 HCC2279 control or gefitinib-resistant cells were 
plated in 1 ml RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 12-well 
plates. Cells were allowed to attach overnight, then treated with the 
indicated drug treatments and cultured over 7 days. Following trypsiniza-
tion, viable cells were counted with a Cellometer (Nexcelom, Lawrence, 
MA, USA) and compared with untreated cell number for each cell line and 
presented as percent control. In some experiments (Supplementary Figure 
S1), cell proliferation was determined using the CyQUANT assay. DMSO 
and resistant cells were seeded at 100 cells per well in 96-well tissue 
culture plates and treated in triplicate with inhibitors at various doses for 7 
days. Relative cell numbers were measured using a CyQUANT Direct Cell 
Proliferation Assay (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to 
the manufacturer's instructions. </p>

<p>4.5. Liver and cardiac histology 
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Hearts (n ¼ 2/group) were 
stopped with KCl, fixed in Zinc Fixative then embedded in paraffin. 
Next, they were cut cross-sectionally, stained in Hematoxylin and eosin 
or picosirus red (collagen), then viewed under polarized light. Livers 
from these animals were fixed, embedded and stained in a similar 
fashion, with the exception that oil red O was used for liver tri-
glycerides. Images of each heart were captured at 20X. The car-
diomyocyte diameter of 8e10 myocytes from 5 captured images per 
animal was analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Image J</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</rs>/) by an

Odyssey Clx Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor) and analyzed by 
densitometry using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Image J</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">NIH</rs>). The absolute quantities of GPx4 and 
HNE-modified protein adducts in human cardiac tissue was deter-
mined by a quantitative ELISA approach developed in our lab, as 
described previously [54]. Fixed concentrations of HNE-adducts were 
made by incubating 4-hydroxynonenal (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, 
MI) with BSA. A standard curve of both recombinant GPx4 (AbFrontier, 
Seoul, Korea) and HNE-modified BSA were then incubated on </p>

<p>4.10. Hydrazide labeling of carbonyl-modified proteins 
Hydrazide Cy5.5 dye (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) was 
diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a stock concentration 1 mg/ml. 
Tissue was homogenized under an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory 
Products, Grass Lake, MI) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, con-
taining 0.1% Triton X-100, and de-gassed using dry vacuum pump 
(Welch No. 25228e01, Monroe, LA). Dye was added to half of the 
homogenate (1:10). The samples were left under anaerobic conditions 
for 2 h and incubated overnight on orbital shaker at 4 C. The other 
aliquot of tissue homogenate was used to quantify protein content. 
Portions of the labeled cardiac tissue homogenate were subjected to 
SDS-PAGE on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel. The gels were scanned 
using Odyssey Clx Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor) and Cy5.5-labeled 
proteins were analyzed by densitometry using <rs id="software-3" type="software">Image J</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">NIH</rs>). </p>

<p>4.11. Statistical analysis 
All animal data are presented as mean AE SEM. Statistical analysis on 
mouse model variables were performed with <rs type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs>

(OMCL-AC160TS-W2) with spring constants between 
36 and 75 N/m were used. The scan frequency was typi-
cally 1.5 Hz per line and the modulation amplitude was 
a few nanometers. Analysis of the DNA-Dan complexes 
was performed using the <rs type="software">Nanoscope</rs> software. Two-
dimensional images in brightness and contrast were 
optimized for the purpose of clarity. Three-dimensional 
images were created with the <rs type="software">Nanoscope</rs> software and 
exported in TIFF format. </p>

ferences between the groups were determined 
by the c

lysis was used to compare means of several 
groups without normal distribution. Associa-
tions between the variables were explored using 
Spearman's rho (for data that are not normally 
distributed). Binary logistic regression analysis 
was also performed to define variables associat-
ed with 25(OH)D. A p-value less than 0.05 was

<p>and the Fisher exact test. The continuous variables were 
compared using the two-tailed unpaired Student t-test 
for the variables with normal distributions, and the two-
tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used for the variables 
with non-normal distributions. The multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was then performed. The logistic re-
gression coefficients were used to assess the odds ratios 
for each independent variable. The entire statistical anal-
ysis was performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 19</rs> for Windows 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM SPSS Inc.</rs>., Armonk, NY, USA). A p-value smaller

<p>In vitro hGYS1 assay. 293T cells were obtained from 
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). 
hGYS1 gene cDNA was derived from the muscle cDNA in 
human MTC Panel I (Takara Βio, Shiga, Japan). The pcDNA 
3.1(+) expression vector (Life Technologies Japan, Kanagawa, 
Japan) containing hGYS1 was transiently transfected into 
293T cells. All transfected cells were cultured for 2 days, then 
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dissolved 
in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM 
EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 
and 1X Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche 
Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The mixture was homog-
enized and centrifuged at 16,000 x g at 4˚C for 15 min. The 
precipitated fraction was then reconstituted in lysis buffer and 
used as a source of the GS enzyme for evaluation after enzyme 
expression levels were verified by immunoblotting. 
The GS (hGYS1) assay was performed as described previ-
ously (20). In short, a solution containing AJS1669 at various 
concentrations with or without 10 mM G6P was added to a 
polystyrene 96-well half-area plate (12 µl/well). Next, 18 µl 
of a substrate solution containing 21.6 mM UDP-glucose, 
21.6 mM phosphoenolpyruvic acid and 4.05 mM NADH was 
added to each well. An enzyme solution containing GS lysates 
(0.17 mg/ml) and 1.5 µl of a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydro-
genase solution was added (18 µl/well) to prepare a reaction 
solution. All reagents in the hGYS assay were purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan). After the reaction 
solution was incubated at 37˚C for 25 min, the absorbance 
at 340 nm was measured using Benchmark Plus (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). 
Test compound activity was calculated according to the 
change in absorbance at 340 nm (ΔA340). The ΔA340 of the 
reaction solutions containing AJS1669 at a final concentration 
of 100 µM (without any G6P present) or 1 µM (with 2.5 mM 
G6P) was taken as a normalization value (100%) to calculate 
the relative activity (%) at various concentrations. The concen-
tration of the compound that elicited a 50% increase in relative 
activity (EC 50 ) was calculated using <rs id="software-0" type="software">XLfit</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IDBS</rs>, Tokyo, 
Japan). </p>

<p>RNA isolation kit (Pharmacia) was used to extract the total 
RNA from cells grown under +Fe and ÀFe conditions, and 
contaminating genomic DNA was digested with DNase I. 
PolyA+ RNA was isolated using a PolyA+ tract mRNA isolation 
kit (Promega). Complementary DNA was synthesized using a 
ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit after priming with oligo-dT. The cDNA 
was then directionally cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of 
the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene). Single and well-separated 
plaques were cored out from agar plates and transferred to 
96-well microtiter plates containing SM buffer. The phage 
stocks were used as templates for cDNA insert amplification 
with T3 and T7 primers (1 nM for each primer). The amplified 
products were separated in 1.5% agarose gels, and clones 
that yielded single polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 
bands were collected for sequencing. Single-pass sequencing 
from the 5 
0 -end of the cDNA insert was initiated with a T3 
primer using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequen-
cing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing products were 
resolved and analysed on an ABI PRISM 377 (Applied Biosys-
tems) or a MEGABACE DNA Sequencer (GE). The nucleotide 
sequences obtained were processed with the <rs id="software-1" type="software">Phred/Phrap/

tated based on the Interpro and Gene Ontology databases. 
Contigs with identity greater than 60% of their length were 
annotated and assigned to KEGG pathways. 
Putative coding regions from the EST data were collected 
from BLASTX alignments, and the codon usage bias was cal-
culated. A Perl script was also written to locate poly-A tails and 
to search 10-35 bp upstream for putative mRNA poly-adeny-
lation signals; the script allowed one mismatch and two 
mismatches from the sequence AAUAAA. Putative signal se-
quences and transmembrane domains in the coding regions 
were identified by <rs id="software-2" type="software">SignalP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">3.0</rs> and <rs id="software-3" type="software">TMHMM</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services</rs>/), respectively. Putative Trichomonas pro-
tein kinases and peptidases were identified by sequence com-
parison with datasets downloaded from the KinBase (http:// 
www.kinase.com) and the MEROPS (http://merops.sanger.ac 
.uk) databases, respectively. </p>

<p>following the protocol for the 3DNA Array 900 Expression 
Array Detection Kit (Genisphere). cDNA hybridizations were 
performed in a VersArray Hybridization Chamber (Bio-Rad) at 
60 
C overnight. Hybridizations with fluorescent 3DNA re-
agents were performed in the same chamber at 60 
C for 
4 h. After the final washing step, the slides were dried by 
centrifugation at 90 Â g for 3 min and scanned using the 
GenePix 4200A scanner (Axon). GenePix Pro 5.1 software 
was used to determine the average signal intensity and the 
local background for each spot. The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence 
ratios were Log 2 transformed and normalized by LOWESS 
normalization method in the TIGR microarray data analysis 
system <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 2.19</rs> (Saeed et al. 2003). In total, 10 independ-
ent hybridizations using samples from 4 independent cultures 
and RNA extractions were performed and data of the inde-
pendent experiments were combined. We used MeV v4.8.1 
to determine significantly regulated genes. One-class Student 
t test was performed and P values were based on all 1,024 
possible permutations (cut-off was 0.01) and the proportion 
of false significant genes was set to not exceed 10 genes. 
The results of all experiments are available in the Array-
Express database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) under 
the array design name TvArray v1.0. </p>

<p>Oligonucleotide primers (supplementary table S1, Supplemen-
tary Material online) were designed using <rs id="software-5" type="software">Primer Designer</rs> 
software <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">v1.01</rs> (Scientific and Education software). The pri-
mers were tested prior to qRT-PCR analysis using DNA as a 
template, and single amplicons of the proper size were 
sequenced. The RT reaction contained 1 mg of total RNA, 
500 ng of Oligo(dT) 15 Primer (Invitrogen), 5 mM DTT 
(Invitrogen), 2 U of RNasin (Invitrogen), 10 U of SuperScriptII 
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 500 mM each of dATP, 
dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The reactions were incubated at 42 
C 
for 50 min followed by 15 min at 70 
C. For qRT-PCR, 1 ml of 
cDNA was amplified in a 25 ml reaction mixture containing 
each gene-specific primer at 50 nM and 12.5 ml of iQTM 
SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad). All reactions were performed 
in triplicate using a RotorGene 2000 Real-Time PCR cycler 
(Corbett Life Science). The expression levels of each gene 
were normalized to those of the housekeeping gene b-tubu-
lin, expression of which is not affected by the availability of 
iron. Relative quantitative values were obtained by the com-
parative threshold cycle (2 </p>

<p>Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the 
MCMV-IE1 nuclear antigen (Ag) (1:2000, kindly provided 
by Dr. S Jonjic, Rijeka, Croatia) 
28 and the MCMV-E1 
nuclear Ag (1:5) 
29 were used for detection of MCMV-
infected cells. 
For immunoperoxidase staining, after microwave treat-
ment, fetal brain sections were reacted with anti-IE1 mAb 
and then with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated 
goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (pAb) (N-Histo-
fine simple stain mouse MAX PO; Nichirei Bioscience, 
Tokyo, Japan), and colored with 3,3-diaminobenzidine 
tetrahydrochloride (DAB). 
For immunofluorescence staining, in addition to mAb 
for MCMV-Ag, the following primary antibodies were 
used: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, rabbit pAb, 
1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), BrdU (rat mAb, 1:200; 
Abcam), Brn2 (goat pAb, 1:100; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), 
Tbr1 (rabbit pAb, 1:100; Chemicon, Billerica, MA), Iba-1 
(rabbit pAb, 1:500, Wako, Osaka, Japan), SOX2 (rabbit 
pAb, 1:200; MBL, Nagoya, Japan), F4/80 (rat mAb, 1:20; 
AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), CD45 (rabbit pAb, 1:100; 
Abcam), major histocopatibility complex (MHC) class II 
(rat mAb, 1:100; BioLegend, San Diego, CA), CD31 (rab-
bit pAb, 1:50; Abcam), and NG2 (rabbit pAb, 1:200; Mil-
lipore, Billerica, MA). The following secondary antibodies 
were also used: Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG1 or 
IgG2a, Alexa Fluor 546 anti-rabbit, -rat, or -goat IgG, or 
Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclei were 
stained with 4 
0 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochlo-
ride (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich). For BrdU staining, sections 
were incubated in 2 N HCl followed by 0.1 mol/L sodium 
borate after microwave treatment. 
Confocal images were captured using an Olympus 
FV1000 microscope with the latest <rs id="software-0" type="software">Fluoview</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Ver.3.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Olympus</rs>, Tokyo, Japan). A stack of five images from

three different animals in each group were used for the 
analysis, and sections from three fields in each brain were 
evaluated. </p>

Þ is interpreted as the speed of return of h to its

is described with the precision parameter s, which is a reciprocal of standard error. 
We follow the procedure described by Tsay (2010) and (Doman and Doman 
2004) and first determine the linear dependencies in the model (1). 
6 Thus, we 
estimate the AR(k) model with explanatory variables. 
7 The model (2)-(3) is 
estimated for standardized residuals obtained from the AR model. 
In order to estimate the SV model we utilize the Bayesian methodology, 
assuming that both the parameters of the model: l; /; c 1 ; . . .; c m ; s and the latent 
variables h 0 ,…,h N are stochastic variables. The estimation is then reduced to the 
problem of finding the posterior densities of the variables based upon their prior 
densities as well as the observed: e 1 ,…,e N . 
For further details we refer the Reader to Meyer and Yu (2000). Estimation of SV 
model was performed using <rs type="software">OpenBugs</rs> program of Meyer and Yu (2000). First 10

<p>Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical 
Analysis System</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS</rs>, 2013). Descriptive statistics for the 
sensory evaluation, WBS, and TPA parameters were 
calculated using the MEAN procedure. The Pearson 
correlation coefficients between sensory evaluation and the 
instrumental measurements were determined using the 
CORR procedure. To establish regression models for 
sensory evaluation variables, the WBS and TPA parameters 
were used as independent variables in the REG procedure. 
A stepwise procedure was used to estimate the percentage 
of variation in sensory evaluation that was explained by the 
instrumental measurements. </p>

<p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test if vari-
ables were to be normally distributed. A P value &gt;0.05 was 
required to assume a normal distribution. Data are expressed in 
terms of median and interquartile range in nonnormal distri-
bution variables and as mean AE standard deviation in normal 
distribution variables. Comparisons between groups were per-
formed using the Mann-Whitney test and Student t test. x 
2 or 
Fisher exact tests were used to analyze the correlation between 
categorical variables. To calculate the relative correlation of the 
hs-CRP value, standardized coefficients (b) and 95% CIs were 
obtained using linear regression models. Univariate and step-
wise linear regression analyses were used. The following factors 
were investigated: PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 , PM 2.5 , age, PD 
duration, serum Cr level, white blood cell count (WBC), nPNA, 
serum albumin, serum total IS, serum total PCS, residual renal 
function test, intact parathyroid hormone level (iPTH), blood 
aluminum (Al) level, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery 
disease (CAD), and hypertension. All the nominal variables in 
linear regression were transformed into dummy coding. Missing 
data was approached with listwise deletion. All statistical 
analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the

<p>ABSTRACT 
The findings of a case study assessing the design and 
implementation of an <rs id="software-1" type="software">electronic health record</rs> (EHR) in 
the <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">public health system of Colima</rs>, Mexico, its 
perceived benefits and limitations, and 
recommendations for improving the implementation 
process are presented. In-depth interviews and focus 
group discussions were used to examine the 
experience of the actors and stakeholders participating 
in the design and implementation of EHRs. Results 
indicate that the main driving force behind the use of 
EHRs was to improve reporting to the two of the 
main government health and social development 
programs. Significant challenges to the success of the 
EHR include resistance by physicians to use the 
ICD-10 to code diagnoses, insufficient attention to 
recurrent resources needed to maintain the system, 
and pressure from federal programs to establish 
parallel information systems. Operating funds and more 
importantly political commitment are required to 
ensure sustainability of the EHRs in Colimaima. </p>

<p>SAECCOL is an EHR developed and implemented by Colima's 
SHS. It is based on the <rs type="software">MS-SQL</rs> Server database management 
system and <rs type="software">Visual Basic</rs> was used for the development of the 
main application and specific modules. It is a modular system 
(figure 1) that at the time of the study operated mainly in the 
outpatient and emergency departments, offering support ser-
vices such as laboratory, imagery, pharmacy, social work and 
archive modules, the last of which is linked to SSPH's data-
bases. The system allows physicians to record and retrieve the 
clinical history of patients, as well as all consultation data 
including drug prescriptions and laboratory studies requested. 
The system had not been fully implemented in the hospital 
environment at the time of the study, with working sub-
modules only operating in admissions and the pharmacy 
department. The archive module also transfers administrative 
data for the management of the SSPH. 
Framework analysis, a method developed specifically for 
applied research where there are particular questions to be 
answered, a limited time frame, and a pre-designed sample, </p>

<p>Interviews were conducted by two native Spanish speak-
ing female researchers with experience in qualitative 
research (August 3-19, 2011, in Colima state and September 
1-19, 2011, in Mexico City). A group of experienced, 
Spanish speaking researchers from INSP and Tulane 
University read the interview and focus group transcripts to 
code the data and group them into key concepts and ana-
lytical axes. Some of the codes were generated according to 
the research questions, while others emerged from the inter-
views. <rs id="software-6" type="software">NVivo</rs> <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">9.2</rs> software 
22 was used to analyze the data 
around three analytical axes: design and development of the 
EHR ( planning and organization, criteria, and require-
ments), implementation of the EHR (users, constraints, and 
resources), and the impact of the EHR (benefits, recommen-
dations, and vision for the future) (table 4). Each researcher 
coded separate interviews. Before starting, a coding exercise 
was conducted to make sure all researchers were interpret-
ing the codes in the same way and there was constant dis-
cussion during the analysis to ensure there was agreement 
across researchers. </p>

<p>In our study, LDPI (PIM 3; Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) 
was used to measure cutaneous blood flow in the dorsal 
flap of the rat. The laser source of the PIM 3 emits a near-
infrared 670-nm laser beam. LDPI scans were made with 
high resolution, under appropriate light at the same light 
intensity and at a constant room temperature of 22°C. The 
distance between the scanner and the flap was 20 cm, and 
the area scanned was 40 × 110 mm. LDPI was first used to 
measure perfusion in the area drawn on the intact skin 
before skin incision (Fig. 2). The flap was subsequently 
elevated according to the drawing and immediately fixed 
(with staples) into its original position. 
PGE1 was then administered through the tail vein; the 
intervention group was given 4 μg/kg/h PGE1 (equiva-
lent to 0.3 mL/h) for 6 hours and the control group sa-
line 0.3 mL/h for 6 hours. The LDPI measurement was 
repeated after 60, 180, and 360 minutes (Fig. 3). 
The measurements quantify differences in flow within 
a single image in perfusion units. Perfusion and the area 
of each perfusion zone were calculated using the software 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">LDPI</rs> win <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.1</rs> (Perimed). </p>

<p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (<rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 21</rs>; Armonk, N.Y.) was used for data analysis. 
Nonparametric tests were used because of relatively few 
samples. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare 
the intervention and control groups with respect to micro-
circulation for the different zones measured in perfusion 
units. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare 
microcirculation at 60 and 360 minutes for the different 
zones for each group. In addition, we have performed a 
Freidman test for intragroup comparison for the differ-
ent time intervals for each zone; P value less than 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>models: gender, number of new sick leaves, number of 
prescriptions of class B drugs, number of elevated GGT 
and MCV levels, number of alcohol-related ICD-10 diag-
noses and number of alcohol-related ICPC-2 diagnoses. 
To do the analyses, the data file was organized in 
long format with one line per event date and varying 
number of lines per patient. Both simple and multiple 
Cox-regression were run. Results are reported as 
unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HR), respect-
ively, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p values 
from Wald tests. The analyses were done using <rs id="software-3" type="software">Stata</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">13</rs> (College Station, TX) and all predictors were 
reported per 10 predictor events. We excluded from 
the model predictor events more than four years prior 
to the present predictor event.[31] Predictor events 
prior to t ¼ 0 were summed up and added to the 
events, however they were also gradually excluded 
during the first four years after t ¼ 0. 
From the final multiple Cox-regression model, a 
prognostic index was defined equal to the fitter linear 
predictor equation in the model. Receiver operator 
characteristics (ROC) of this index was evaluated 
against the patients' c-AUD status four years after each 
update of the index (i.e., new predictor event) by cal-
culating sensitivity and specificity and plotting the cor-
responding ROC curve.[27] </p>

sidered statistically significant. </p>

<p>STATISTICAL METHODS 
The sample size was calculated using equivalence 
margins rather than probability levels: further details are 
presented in the companion paper. 
8 The trial was 
powered to 90% and the minimum importance differ-
ence was 10% of cost. The results were analysed using 
an intention to treat and per protocol analysis. 
Economic evaluation data are invariably positively 
skewed, and it requires an alternative analysis. 
13 14 The 
study data were analysed using a non-parametric boot-
strapping technique. Bootstrapping makes no assump-
tions regarding the equality, variance or shape of the 
distribution, and takes into account skewness. 
15 It 
derives arithmetic means recommended by some 
authors 
10 that can be used to compare the groups and 
generates CIs using a computer-generated programme 
to repeatedly sample from the observed data which is 
then analysed.

<p>) test. In 
univariate analysis, variables with P &lt; 0.1 between survivals 
and deaths were considered as potential risk factors for 
mortality and included into a multivariable logistic regression 
model for adjustment. After every PLT index had been 
adjusted by clinical covariates, the ORs for mortality in 
patients with normal or abnormal PLT indices were presented. 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test was applied to test Goodness-of-fit 
properties. Collinearity was determined by variance inflation 
factor (VIF). The value of VIF more than 5 indicated the 
existence of multicollinearity. 
[11] Second, to explore the 
relationship between PLT indices and illness severity, we 
first divided each PLT index into tertiles of the normal range, 
higher than upper limit, lower than lower limit. Then, we 
plotted the distribution of APACHE II scores and SOFA 
scores in each tertile to investigate whether the patients with 
abnormal PLT indices were associated with higher illness 
scores. Third, to evaluate the performance of the PLT indices 
in predicting death events, we built the ROCs for every index 
and compared the area under the curves (AUC). We also 
calculated optimal cut-off point (where the Youden index 
reached the maximum value) 
[12] and the diagnostic parameters 
including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, 
negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic accuracy for each 
PLT index. Finally, to compare the prognosis in patient with 
normal and abnormal PLT indices, we used the Kaplan-
Meier method to construct survival curves for the each 
group. Log-rank test was used for comparison of different 
survival curves between patients with normal and abnormal 
PLT indices. All the statistical analysis was performed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Stata</rs><rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">10</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">StataCorp LP</rs>, College Station, TX,

<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">GraphPad Software Inc.</rs>., CA, USA). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
The chi-square test was used to compare categorical data. 
To exclude the outliers, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used 
to identify significant median differences among groups. p-
values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. All statistical 
analyses were conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> 
® software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 11.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">StataCorp LP</rs>, Lakeway, TX, USA). </p>

<p>Sensitivity analysis was also conducted by sequential omis-
sion of individual studies to evaluate stability of the results. 
Publication bias was estimated by Egger's linear regression test 
with a funnel plot. 
21 The statistical analyses were performed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 12.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Stata Corporation</rs>,

P,0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>Image accusation was performed essentially as described in 
Meaburn et al. (2009). Briefly, tissue sections were imaged with an 
IX70 (Olympus, Waltham, MA) DeltaVision (Applied Precision-GE 
Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) system, using a 60×/1.42 
numerical aperture oil objective lens (Olympus) and an auxiliary 
magnification of 1.5. Image stacks were acquired with a 0.5-μm step 
interval along the z-axis. If mixed morphologies were present in a 
tissue section, before imaging, the tissue was visually inspected at 
low resolution (10× lens; Olympus) to identify malignant, normal, or 
hyperplastic regions. In these cases, hematoxylin and eosin-stained 
tissue slides that had been marked by a pathologist (L.D.T.) were 
used as a guide to ensure correct classification of different regions 
of a tissue. Image stacks were deconvolved and converted into max-
imum intensity projections using SoftWoRx (Applied Precision). 
Image analysis was performed as previously described (Meaburn 
et al., 2009). Images were contrast enhanced based on visual inspec-
tion, and individual nuclei were manually delineated in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Photoshop</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">7.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Adobe</rs>, San Jose, CA), with each nucleus saved in a separate 
image file. To determine the relative radial positioning of a gene in a 
given tissue, 91-263 randomly selected interphase epithelial nuclei 
were run though a custom-made image analysis software package 
(P. Gudla and S. Lockett, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; 
Meaburn et al., 2009) in <rs id="software-1" type="software">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">MathWorks</rs>, Natick, MA) using the

<p>All determinations were performed on a Thermo Separation

ment (TSP, Stone, UK). Data collecting and handling were 
carried out using dedicated software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">Spectacle</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">TSP</rs>). The </p>

<p>Differences between groups were compared by using either 
a two-tailed parametric test (unpaired Student's t-test) or a 
nonparametric test (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) where 
appropriate (<rs id="software-1" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5.04</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">GraphPad Software, Inc.</rs>.,

<p>resulting from the labeled cAMP-d2 (665 nm) were recorded. 
Results were calculated from the 665/620 nm ratio and ex-
pressed as ⌬F (⌬F % ϭ ((Standard or sample ratio Ϫ Ratio neg )/ 
Ratio neg ) ϫ 100). All data were normalized to the functional 
response obtained with 300 M propionic acid. 
Inositol Monophosphate (IP 1 ) Accumulation Assays-The 
HTRF-IP One kit (CIS Bio International) was used for mea-
suring IP 1 production in cells expressing FFA2. In a 384-well for-
mat, the cell suspension was dispensed at 100,000 cells/7 
l/well. After 20-min incubation at 37°C, 7 l of stimulation 
buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 50 mM 
LiCl) containing various concentrations of ligand were added. 
After further incubation at 37°C for 30 min, 3 l of IP 1 -d 2 
conjugate followed by 3 l of europium cryptate-labeled anti-
IP 1 antibody were added. Time-resolved fluorescence at 620 
and 665 nm was measured with the Mithras LB 940 multimode 
reader after incubation at room temperature for 60 min, and the 
ratios of the signals expressed as ⌬F were calculated as 
described above. Data were normalized to the IP 1 response 
obtained with 300 M propionic acid.

receptor (Protein Data Bank code 2RH1) as a template was con-
ducted using <rs id="software-3" type="software">MOE</rs> software (Molecular Operating Environ-
ment, <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-date">2009</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Chemical Computing Group, Inc.</rs>., Montreal, 
Quebec, Canada) with a default homology modeling protocol. 
Selection of homology models was based on the location of 
extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). Only models where ECL2 was 
located relatively similarly to the available crystal structures of 
the ligand-bound GPCRs were considered for docking. Thus, 
ECL2 conformations that prevented entrance to the putative 
binding cavity were excluded for the next steps. The available 
model of FFA1 (21), with the side-chain conformers optimized 
according to mutagenesis data for HisVI:16/4.56, ArgV:05/ 
5.39, HisVI:20/6.55, and ArgVII:02/7.35, was used to optimize 
the rough homology models of hFFA2 and hFFA3 obtained. 
Docking of SCAs into these models and those containing pro-
posed mutants was performed using the Glide module of 
<rs type="software">Schrödinger</rs> software (22). The Glide docking box included the 
cavity between transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6 involving 
residues at positions V:05/5.39, VII:02/7.35, and VI:20/6.55, 
which we have shown to be crucial for anchoring the carboxyl 
group of fatty acids (18). The Glide default settings with the 
extraprecision scoring option were used for docking. Images 
were prepared using the Maestro 8.5 interface (23). 
Data Analysis-All data were quantified, grouped, and ana-
lyzed using <rs id="software-5" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">5.02</rs> and are expressed as mean Ϯ 
S.E. Data were fit to both three-parameter (fixed Hill slope) and 
four-parameter non-linear regression isotherms. The three-pa-
rameter curve fit was statistically appropriate in all cases. </p>

<p>Conformer selection and molecular alignment are the most 
essential steps in 3D-QSAR studies. The accuracy and reliability 
of the CoMFA model is directly dependent on the molecular 
alignment rule. 
11 In this study, the alignments were carried out 
using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">SYBYL-X</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">1.1</rs> software package (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Tripos, International</rs>, 
St Louis, MO, USA) and made based on the presence of a moiety 
common to all derivatives, by adopting the RMS (root mean 
square) atom-fit rule for superposition of individual atoms. Two 
different alignments were performed and three models were 
generated from each one. The most active compound from 
the series (33) was used as the template for both alignments 
(Figure 1). In alignment I, all atoms of the tricyclic phthalimide 
moiety were chosen, except for the hydroxyl groups and external 
carbon atoms of the pyrazine ring. In alignment II, all atoms of 
tricyclic phthalimide moiety were chosen (Figure 1). </p>

<p>After obtaining the real measurements, the phantom 
was scanned in the i-CAT device, following an image ac-
quisition protocol of a 6-cm × 16-cm field of view (FOV), 
20 seconds, and a 0.2-mm voxel size. In the PreXion de-
vice, the phantom was scanned following an image ac-
quisition protocol of 5-cm × 5-cm FOV, 19 seconds, and 
a 0.1-mm voxel size. Thereafter, multiplanar reformatting 
was performed, thereby obtaining axial sections with a 
thickness of 1.0 mm. The data were saved in the Digital 
Imaging and Communications in Medicine format using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Prexion3DViewer</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 2.4.1.20</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">PreXion Inc.</rs>., San Mateo, CA, USA) to measure the diameter of 
each axial image. 
The diameter of the phantom was measured in sections, 
using 2 coordinates (An/Bn and Cn/Dn) with numbers 
from 2 to 7, in the depth of the channel, that is, between </p>

<p>the "points" marked with zinc oxide and eugenol. This 
measurement was performed using a software tool. For 
each axial image, measurements were made in either hori-
zontal direction (the A-B distance) and in either vertical 
direction (the C-D distance), twice, with a 1-week interval, 
by 4 examiners (4 oral radiologists) with 5 years or more 
experience in the use of these measuring tools. All post-
processing procedures were carried out using the same 
software, <rs id="software-2" type="software">Prexion3DViewer</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 2.4.1.20</rs>, and the im-
ages were visualized on a 24-inch LG E 2241 LCD moni-
tor with a matrix resolution of 1920 × 1080. The values of 
the 2 repetitions for each coordinate were entered into an 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">Excel</rs> spreadsheet (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Microsoft</rs>, Seattle, WA, USA), sepa-
rated by examiner, by scanner, by section, and by distance 
(A-B and C-D). 
Statistical analysis was applied to the collected data 
using <rs id="software-4" type="software">SPSS</rs> Statistics for Windows, (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 20.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">IBM Corp.</rs>., Armonk, NY, USA). Intraclass correlation coeffi-
cient (ICC) calculations were used to verify intraobserver 
and interobserver agreement and to compare the accuracy 
(reproducibility) of the i-CAT and PreXion CBCT with 
the real measurements (the gold standard). The linear mea-
surements (mm) were subjected to descriptive analysis 
to present the absolute and relative errors (in %) of the 
measurements performed on the acquisitions made with 
both CBCT machines in relation to the gold standard. The 
Student t-test was used to compare the scans to each other 
regarding the linear measurements. The significance level 
used for all tests was 5% (α = .05). </p>

<p>Treatment effects were compared from each follow-up 
visit to the baseline scores using paired t-tests. Data were

SVM is a more sophisticated method; it is a very effi-
cient learning algorithm for high-dimensional data in 
classification, regression and pattern recognition. The 
basis of SVM is to implicitly map data to a higher dimen-
sional space via a kernel function in order to identify an 
optimal hyperplane that maximises the margin between 
the two groups. 
27 There are many software packages 
available to implement SVM. In this study, we use the 
<rs type="software">e1071-package of R</rs> with a default radial basis function 
kernel to obtain the prediction scores. </p>

<p>measured with standard flow cytometric methods. T cell acti-
vation and senescence were measured by immunophenotyping 
performed at the University of California, San Francisco, Core 
Immunology Laboratory, using methods that have been opti-
mized and validated for frozen peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs). Cryopreserved PBMCs were rapidly thawed in 
warm medium, washed, stained with Viacount (Millipore), and 
run on a Guava PCA (Millipore) to determine cell number and 
viability. Samples with viability of ,40% were not analyzed. 
PBMCs were stained with aqua amine reactive dye (Invitrogen) 
to exclude nonviable cells and for surface expression of CD3, 
CD28 (BD Pharmingen), CD4, CD38, HLA-DR (BD Bio-
sciences), CD8 (Invitrogen), and CD57 (Biolegend). Stained 
cells were run on a customized BD LSR II and data analyzed 
using <rs id="software-1" type="software">FlowJo</rs> software, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 8.8.4</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Tree Star</rs>) to quantitate

debris, monocytes, and doublets. Dead cells were excluded by gating on 
aqua amine reactive dye-negative cells, and total T cells were defined by 
CD3

subpopulation gates. The mean peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
viability was 75.0% in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected 
women and 77.5% in HIV-uninfected women. </p>

<p>Of the 284 logistics service providers, 56 responded, of 
which 51 were evaluated. This shows a response rate of 
almost 20%, which can be regarded as representative when 
viewed in terms of general beliefs and academic acceptance. 
Representativeness is further strengthened by the market 
share of the respondents (50%), and the test results of the 
general and sample population in terms of their geographi-
cal location and distribution. From this list the target group 
was selected, including enterprises with a revenue (net sa-
les) of at least 100 000 EUR, but not higher than EUR 100 
million per year. Our sample represents the opinions of 
big companies of the sector, because of their relatively low 
response rate and large share of revenue in the industrial 
sector. At the same time, as shown above, the geographical 
distribution of the sample corresponded to the distribution 
of the population. 13% of the interviewed LSPs were esta-
blished in 1990, when a number of entrepreneurs decided 
to set up their own companies due to the political and 
economic restructuring occurring in the region. More than 
50% of the examined LSPs were engaged in the domestic 
and international road transport of goods or road forwar-
ding services directly after their establishment. 32% of the 
newly-established LSPs were primarily involved in ware-
housing activities. The following activities ranged between 
10%-20%: railway transport and/or forwarding, air freight 
and/or forwarding, water freight and/or forwarding, trans-
port and/or forwarding of containers, custom-house agent 
activities, transport and/or forwarding of oversized goods, 
logistics activities outsourced by clients inside or outside 
the factory yard, freight insurance and logistics consultan-
cy. Seventy-five per cent of the enterprises involved in the 
research were primarily Hungarian-owned. 
GfK Hungary Market Research Institute contributed 
significantly to the structure of the questionnaire, we created 
the professional content, and the possible response forms 
and types were greatly influenced by the data quality and 
type that can be managed and expected by the evaluation 
software (<rs type="software">SPSS</rs>). Questionnaires were completed using the 
Computer Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) method. The 
internet-based questionnaire technique provided an effec-
tive research background for this target group by allowing 
respondents to answer questions on delicate corporate is-
sues (financial issues, role of suppliers, etc.) more honestly, 
as the interviewee's response was not affected by the pres-
ence of the interviewer. </p>

<p>Subjects reported to the laboratory and their 
height, weight and total body fat were measured 
using a portable stadiometer and body composition 
analyzer (BC-418, Tanita, Japan), respectively. Then 
the subjects completed a maximal oxygen consump-
tion test (VO 2 max). VO 2 max was measured on a 
motor-driven treadmill (Run race, Techno gym, Italy), 
using an indirect calorimetry system (Quark b2, 
Cosmed, Italy) with an incremental exercise test to 
volitional fatigue. To estimate average energy and 
nutritional intake, soccer players recorded their 
dietary intake during 4 consecutive days. The energy, 
macronutrient and micronutrient intakes were calcu-
lated using <rs id="software-0" type="software">CRON-O-Meter</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v0.9.6</rs>. software. </p>

<p>Data were inspected for normal distribution 
using the Kolmogrov-Smirnov test. Results are 
expressed as mean ± SEM for normally distributed 
variables. When the distribution differed from normal, 
geometric means and 95% confidence intervals were 
given. Hematological and biochemical parameters 
were analyzed using the ANOVA repeated-measures 
general linear model. Non-normally distributed data 
were transformed logarithmically, before statistical 
comparisons were made. Spearman's non-parametric 
correlation analysis was used to assess univariate 
associations between studied variables. P values ≤ 
0.05 were considered statistically significant. Stati -
stical analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">PASW 
Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 18.0</rs> and <rs id="software-2" type="software">MedCalc</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 11.4</rs>

<p>A 26-year-old pregnant woman in her first trimester presented with progressive fatigue. Her Electro-
cardiogram showed second degree heart block (Mobitz type II) with intermittent complete heart block. 
We decided to proceed with dual-chamber permanent pacemaker implantation using <rs type="software">CARTO</rs> mapping 
system to avoid fluoroscopy exposure. A mapping catheter was inserted through the right femoral vein. 
An electro-anatomical map of cardiac chambers was created using the mapping catheter. Through left 
axillary vein access, the two pacemaker leads were successfully positioned guided by the electro-
anatomical map. No complications were noted post procedure. Pacemaker was functioning appropri-
ately at follow-up visits. 
Fluoroscopy is the main imaging technique currently used for 
various cardiovascular procedures. However, use of fluoroscopy in 
pregnant women constitutes substantial hazards to the fetus. We 
present a case of a young pregnant woman with a complete 
Atrioventricular (AV) block in whom a permanent pacemaker 
(PPM) insertion was performed without fluoroscopy using electro-
anatomical mapping (EAM) system. </p>

<p>Exercise tolerance test was done and revealed worsening degree 
of heart block with exercise confirming infra-nodal conduction 
disease. Patient met class I indication for PPM implantation, and 
decision was made to proceed with dual-chamber PPM insertion 
using <rs type="software">CARTO</rs> mapping system (Biosense, Webster, Inc.) to avoid 
fluoroscopy exposure. 
A mapping catheter (Biosense, Webster, Inc.) was inserted 
through the right femoral vein. An EAM of the inferior vena cava, 
superior vena cava, right atrium (RA), coronary sinus ostium, 
tricuspid valve annulus (TVA) and the right ventricle (RV) septum 
was created using the mapping catheter. The right brachiocephalic 
trunk and the left innominate vein anatomy were further defined 
with the mapping. Following this, we proceeded with pacemaker 
implantation. Under local anesthesia, an oblique infra-clavicular 
incision was made on the skin and the pocket was subsequently 
created in the left pectoral area. Using ultrasound guidance, the left 
axillary vein was punctured, and two 6 French venous sheaths were 
advanced over separate guide wires. A 58 cm Ingevity (Boston </p>

of fluoroscopy, EAM systems offer the advantage of creating a 3D 
image which can efficiently guide catheters through different car-
diac chambers, compared to the 2D image offered by fluoroscopy 
[4]. 
We report a case of successful dual chamber PPM in a pregnant 
woman guided by non-fluoroscopic EAM system. Few case-series 
exist on using EAM guidance for PPM insertion in general popula-
tion [4,6]. To the best of our knowledge this is the third case of dual 
chamber PPM in a pregnant women using EAM system [3,7]. The 
EAM helped creating a geometric image of cardiac chambers, and 
with help of intracardiac recordings and pacing maneuvers, we 
were able to navigate our catheters properly. Specifically, we didn't 
appreciate difficulty crossing tricuspid valve annulus with the right 
ventricular (RV) lead or in placing the lead in RV apex with optimal 
pacing settings. 
In summary, we present a rare case of dual-chamber PPM im-
plantation in a pregnant woman, guided by EAM using <rs type="software">CARTO</rs> </p>

<p>Abstract 
Introduction: People in tropical and semi-tropical areas are in danger of scorpion sting, and this can be a serious 
problem for them. Mortality due to scorpion sting in the tropical and semi-tropical areas of Iran is about 75%, and 
this makes scorpion sting in these areas a serious medical problem. Because of this problem, our aim was to assess 
the epidemiological aspects of scorpion sting in Bandar Abbas, Iran, during 2009-2011. 
Methods: In this cross-sectional retrospective study, epidemiologic data of 698 scorpion sting cases, who were 
referred to the Shahid Mohamadi Hospital of Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan Province collected from 2009 until 
2011. The data included demographic and individual information, such as age, gender, geographic location, bite 
site, when the incident occurred, and anti-venom consumption. The required data were extracted from the patients' 
recorded information in the Hospital, and we recorded data in a special checklist and imported the data into the 
computer for statistical analysis using of <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 21.0</rs>. Descriptive statistics, including mean, 
standard deviation, frequency, and percentage, were used for data analysis. 
Results: Two hundred and sixty-one (37.4%) of the cases were urban and 437(62.6%) were rural. Males comprised 
50.1% of the cases, and women comprised 49.9% (p &gt;0.05). Twenty-five point two percent of scorpion sting cases 
occurred among people in the 21 to 30 age group, and there were very few cases among people in the 51 to 60 age 
range (p&lt;0.05). Most of cases were recorded in April and October, and the fewest cases were recorded in July and 
January (p&lt;0.05); also 32.2% of scorpion sting cases occurred after midnight and in the early morning hours. 
Conclusion: Our survey showed that there was a high incidence of scorpion stings in rural areas, among 21-30 age 
group, among housekeepers, and among students. These results indicate the need for public education programs 
and better sanitation services in the rural areas around Bandar Abbas city. Prospective studies can help to health 
and medicine organization for prevention and treatment of scorpion sting. 
1.2. Statement of problem 
In west and southwest of Iran, scorpion sting is one of the medical problems. Razi Serum Institution's studies have 
shown that the most mortality due to poisoning are from scorpion stings (8). The mortality rate associated with 
scorpion sting in the tropical and semi-tropical areas of Iran is about 75%, and this makes scorpion sting in these areas 
a serious medical problem. Khuzestan, Sistan Baloochestan, Charmahal Bakhtiari, Bushehr and Hormozgan Provinces 
have more reported scorpion sting cases than anywhere else in Iran (9-11). More than 2,300 cases of scorpion sting 
per year occur in Hormozgan Province, and most of the cases are in Bandar Abbas County. Between 2011 and 2014, 
four deaths of children less than five years old occurred due to scorpion sting in Bandar Abbas. This study tries to 
clarify the epidemiologic status of scorpion stings in Hormozgan Province in the absence of any past epidemiologic 
studies. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
We performed statistical analyses on the rotarod scores 
using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">Statistical Analysis System</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">Enterprise 4.1</rs>; SAS 
Korea) on a CHA University mainframe computer. Perfor-
mance measures were analyzed using the PROC MIXED 
program, a linear mixed models procedure. A p value of 
＜0.05 was considered significant. </p>

<p>For statistical evaluation the software <rs id="software-0" type="software">NCSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">8</rs> 
was used. For comparing the quantitative data we 
used either the two-sided t-test or the nonparamet-
ric Mann-Whitney, or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
To evaluate the qualitative data we used the c 
2 test 
of independence in a contingency table or Fisher's 
exact test. Values of p were obtained with the likeli-
hood-ratio test and considered significance if &lt; 0.05. </p>

<p>the patients' medical records. For complications, we counted 
cases in which patients had related drug prescriptions even 
if there was no diagnosis and cases in which there were 
diseases diagnosed based on the patients' medical records. 
If the patients had received education at other institutions, 
the education was excluded because of lack of clear records 
and quality control. When patients were medicated with hy-
pertension-and dyslipidemia-related drugs, we whether or 
not there were medical records. All cancers were included. 
All statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> for 
Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v. 12.0 K</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). The 
results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation 
(SD) and number (percent). The general and clinical char-
acteristics of the patients in the exercise and non-exercise 
groups, including age, height, weight, and others results, 
were analyzed with the independent t-test. Differences were 
considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05. Pearson's 
correlation coefficients were used to assess the relation 
between metabolic regulation (blood pressure, glucose, 
HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL and LDL 
cholesterol) and exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Moreover, univariate logistic regression was used to assess 
the associations between achievement of goals for metabolic 
regulation of medical characteristics and complications and 
exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. The odds ratios for 
each factor in each model were calculated with Wald-type 
95% confidence intervals. </p>

<p>Smoking was defined as habitual cigarette smoking 
during the last 6 months. The history of taking the vi-
tamin D supplements was defined as the consumption 
of any pharmaceutical products containing vitamin D 
(including oral and injection products) during the last 6 
months. 
For the severity of pain, Quadruple VAS (Visual Ana-
logue Scale) was used. 
The analysis of the collected data was with <rs id="software-0" type="software">IBM SPSS 
statistics package</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 20.0</rs> (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). It 
was used for the descriptive statistics including the means, 
ratios and their confidence intervals, and also the dia-
grams and tables. Statistical tests included the indepen-
dent t-test, one-way analysis of variance, chi-square, uni-
variate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. 
The significance level was set at 0.05 for all the statistical 
tests. 
The study was evaluated by Ethics Committee for Medi-
cal Research at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences 
(approval/ registration number 493054). </p>

<p>ing language (<rs id="software-0" type="software">MATLAB</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">R2010a</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">MathWorks Inc.</rs>., Natick, 
MA, USA). The ROI, a square portion of 64×64 pixels, 
was extracted by dragging the mouse from a randomly 
selected single point to 64 pixels left and 64 pixels down-
ward. The tooth structure, periodontal ligament, and lamina 
dura were excluded from each ROI. Next, the noise was 
removed by median filtering. Morphological skeletoniza-
tion was then used to extract the medial axis of the trabe-
cular bone, which was regarded as the prominent region 
that was brighter than the surrounding structures, and sub-
sequently, the images were enlarged 64-fold. The 'strel' 
function was selected from the computing language to </p>

<p>create a flat, rectangle-shaped structuring element (strel 
('rectangle',[2 3])) where [2 3] is the size. In the matrix 
[2 3], the first element was the number of rows in the str-
ucturing element neighbourhood; the second element was 
the number of columns. Then, the most basic morpholog-
ical operations, which were 'erosion' and 'dilation,' were 
performed. The 'erosion' function removed pixels on the 
object boundaries, while dilation added pixels to the bound-
aries of objects in an image. The number of pixels added 
or removed from the objects in an image depends on the 
size and the shape of the structuring element used to pro-
cess the image. Finally, the pixel area calculation was used 
to estimate the area of the trabecular bone in the binary 
image, that is, the digital image that had only two possible 
values for each pixel, namely 0 and 1 (Figs. 1 and 2). The 
pixel area of the "non-cleft side" and "cleft side" from 
group 0 to group 4 were calculated and compared. The 
measurements were made five times, once a week, on each 
side by an oral radiologist. Five positions were randomly 
selected at the "non-cleft side" and "cleft side" on the same 
image. All of the pixel areas of the image were then cal-
culated. Statistical tests were performed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">10.1</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were 
applied. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate a nor-
mally distributed pixel area. Wilcoxon signed ranks test 
was used when the data did not show normal distribution 
and the paired samples t test was used when the data show-
ed normal distribution. The study design was approved by 
the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human 
Research. </p>

<p>The CAD system, therefore, has been developed to deter-
mine the bone quantity in the alveolar cleft after bone 
grafting. This CAD system uses mathematical morpholo-
gy and calculates the area on the binary images that can 
be produced by <rs type="software">MathWorks</rs>. Our results showed that the 
pixel areas from the binary images in the "cleft side" were 
significantly smaller than those on the "non-cleft side" in 
group 0 (before bone grafting) and group 1 (one month 
after bone grafting). This means that the trabecular bone 
increased but was still less than the normal side. In addi-
tion, there was no significant difference found in group 2 
(2-4 months after bone grafting) and group 3 (5-7 months 
after bone grafting), which means the trabecular bone grad-
ually increased in the 2-4 months and was similar to the 
normal bone within 5-7 months. It should be noted that the 
new bone formation with osteoid deposition indicated 
remodeling of 25-55% at 3 months postoperatively and 
the grafted bone had a denser structure than the control </p>

<p>term follow-up is suggested to evaluate the trabecular bone 
at the bone grafting area in comparison to the side with 
normal bone. Dental radiographs may be used with the 
CAD system to evaluate the bone grafting area more easily 
than CT images and show cost-effectiveness. 
The CAD system was developed based on mathematical 
morphology using <rs type="software">MathWorks</rs>. The ROI can be controlled 
by using the same size and can be changed into binary 
images for calculating the pixel area that corresponds to 
the total number of pixels in the image. The CAD system 
could be useful for evaluating grafting failure, which 
would permit re-grafting before the eruption of the teeth 
and improve the prognosis of cleft lip and palate patients. 
Trindade et al 
8 and Jia et al 
17 showed 86% and 88% success </p>

<p>Finally, we used multivariate logistic regression to examine the 
combined effects of household income, diet intakes, and PA 
on overweight and obesity. Four models were performed by 
consecutively including predictors of overweight and obesity. 
Firstly, we included household income and year (Model 1). 
Subsequently, dietary energy intake was added (Model 2). 
Next moderate and vigorous PA was also included (Model 3). 
Sedentary activity was finally included (Model 4). To interpret 
odds ratios (ORs), we simulated the predicted prevalence of 
overweight and obesity if all subjects had the diet and PA 
profiles of the low-, medium-, or high-income levels in 1997 
and 2009. Although the CHNS is longitudinal in nature, the 
present study focused on cross-sectional analysis of data 
in 1997 and 2009. All analyses were conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs>

(18) in a 12.5% separating gel 
and developed with silver staining. Further 
analysis of stained SDS-PAGE slabs for yield 
measurements was performed by densito-
metry using a GS-800 Bio-Rad Imaging 
Densitometer and employing <rs type="software">Quantity One 
analyzer</rs> according to the software manual. 
Western analysis was performed by electro-
blotting of proteins from SDS-PAGE gel to 
Whatman nitrocellulose membranes (Schlei-
cher &amp; Schuell). 
Tracking of the protein was achieved by 
employing the monoclonal (mouse) antibody 
against rHuEpo (CIGB, Havana, Cuba) and/ 
or monoclonal (mouse) anti-His(C-term) anti-
body (Invitrogen) as the primary and horse-
radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse 
IgG (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, 
USA) as the secondary antibody. The bands 
were developed using DAB chromogenic sub-
strate (Sigma-Aldrich). N-terminal amino acid 
sequencing was performed by Edman's deg-
radation method on the purified sample elec-
troblotted onto PVDF membrane (Institut fur 
Chemeie, Universitat fur Bodenkultur Wien, 
Austria). Cell concentrations were measured 
with a Perkin Elmer UV/VIS spectrophoto-
meter (Lambda EZ 201) based on absorbance 
at 600 nm using a calibration curve. 
Statistical analyses of the data were per-
formed using Student's t test and one-way 
multivariate ANOVA to calculate p value. 
P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. </p>

<p>Monoseptic nl-reactors harboring one colony only were 
enriched by COPAS sorting employing the '<rs type="software">Profiler</rs>' soft-
ware (21). Pulse shape diagram recording was triggered by 
the opacity signal [threshold &gt;25 AU (arbitrary units); 
signal gain factor 1.5; measuring range 0-65500 AU]. nl-
Reactor size is expressed as time-of-flight [(ToF); gated 
range 400-750 ToF, arbitrary units]. Fluorescence signals 
for colony detection were generally recorded at 510 nm, 
which is the emission maximum of the employed GFP 
[ex 488 nm, photon multiplier settings (PMT) 800 V; gain 
factor 1.0; measuring range 0-65 500 AU; peak-
profiling was initiated at &gt;20 000 AU; gated range 
60 000-65 500]. The COPAS-device was operated at an 
average frequency of 30 Hz and coincidence settings for 
dispensing into microtiter plates were adjusted to 'pure'-
mode which guarantees that nl-reactors are only sorted-
out if no other reactor is coincidentally within the same 
droplet. A detailed description of the cell encapsulation, 
proliferation and isolation procedure employed for enrich-
ment of monoseptic nl-reactors by COPAS, was published 
elsewhere (21). </p>

<p>Genscript, Piscataway, NJ]. All gas bubbles were 
removed, the PCR-bag was air-tightly sealed, and cycled 
on a custom-built flat-screen thermocycler that consisted 
of a chamber flanked by aluminum plates which contained 
channels for water circulation for temperature control (32 
cycles; 90 s at 968C; 180 s at 558C) exerted by two water-
baths (Huber Polystat CC3; set to 968C and 568C, respec-
tively). Numerically, controlled thermo-switching between 
the two water cycles was realized with four valves (m&amp;m 
international, Bedford, UK) controlling the in-and outlet 
of the water baths and a customized <rs id="software-2" type="software">LabView</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">National Instruments</rs>; Austin; TX) program controlling the relay-
switch station USB-Erb24 (Measurement Computing 
Corp., Norton, MA). After cycling, the beads were recov-
ered from the bag by sieving, washed with 50 ml washing 
solution and 250 ml ddH 2 O and suspended in a Petri dish 
with 20 ml washing solution containing 1Â SYBR Green I 
dye (Invitrogen; Carlsbad; CA) in order to stain PCR-
products prior to another COPAS analysis. Microscopic 
pictures were taken by a Zeiss Axio Star Plus fluorescence 
microscope (Carl Zeiss AG; Go¨ttingen; Germany) using 
an excitation filter at 488 nm and an emission long-pass 
filter &gt;520 nm in combination with phase contrast 
microscopy. </p>

<p>Clone-redundancy was tested with the <rs id="software-5" type="software">DNA Star</rs> Software 
(<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">DNAstar inc.</rs>., Madison, WI). Default assembly param-
eters were used: match size: 12 bp; minimum match

imum added gaps per kb in contig: 70 bp; maximum added 
gaps per kb in sequence: 70 bp; last group considered: 2; 
gap penalty: 0.00; gap length penalty: 0.70. 
Only sequences with a match to the screening primer of 
10 bases or more were used to subsequently design micro-
satellite markers. Next, PCR primers flanking the CT-rich 
region were designed by the primer-3 software; http://fok 
ker.wi.mit.edu/primer3/input.htm). Amplicon length poly-
morphism of microsatellite markers was tested by PCR on 
seven different cassava cultivars (91/02322; TMS60444; 
95/0306; 98/0002; TAI-8; PER-183; COL-1505) using 
FAM-labeled primers. PCRs were performed in a final 
volume of 20 ml: 1Â PCR Buffer, 200 mM each dNTP, 
200 nM of each primer, 5 ng template; 1.75 U Taq DNA 
polymerase; cycling conditions: initial denaturation: 958C 
for 1 min; 35 cycles: 958C for 30 s, 568C for 30 s, 728C for

used to assess the significance of intergroup variability. Two-
tailed Mann-Whitney U tests were used for between group 
comparisons. The differences in proportions between groups 
were evaluated with χ 
2 tests. Bonferroni corrections were ap-
plied to adjust for multiple comparisons (i.e., α=0.05/3=0.016). 
Spearman tests were used to examine the correlations. The lev-

<p>Transmission electron microscopy. Four-month-old mice pretreated with 
HFD for 8 weeks were used. Muscles were isolated, fixed with 2.5% glutaral-
dehyde in 0.1M Sorenson's buffer (PH 7.2), and treated with 1% OsO4 also in 
Sorenson's buffer for 1 h. After dehydration and embedment in Lx-112 (Ladd 
Research Industries), thin sections (60 nm) were cut using a MT-7000 
ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined 
under a JEOL JEM-1200 EXII electron microscope. Pictures were captured by 
an ORCA-HR digital camera (Hamamatsu) and recorded with an AMT Image 
Capture Engine. 
Indirect calorimetry. Twenty-week-old weight-matched male MCK-DGAT1 
mice and wild-type littermates that had been on a HFD for 8 weeks were singly 
housed in metabolic chambers. After 2-4 days of adaptation, oxygen con-
sumption, locomotor activity, and respiration exchange ratio were measured 
continuously over at least 5 days during 12:12 light-dark cycles, using a CLAMS 
(Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) open-circuit indirect calorimetry 
system as previously described (27). 
RT-PCR, Western blot, DGAT activity, and triglyceride contents. Four-
month-old mice with 8-week HFD pretreatment were used for these experi-
ments. RT-PCR (3,28) and Western blot (3,29) were as described. Gene-
specific primer sets are listed in supplemental Table 1. Primary antibodies to 
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4, uncoupling protein (UCP)-3, CD36, 
and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were obtained 
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). DGAT activity was measured in vitro using 
[ 
14 C]-labeled palmitoyl-CoA as previously described (29,30). The method to 
quantify muscle triglyceride content was as described (3,29). 
Statistical analysis. Statistical differences were first analyzed by ANOVA to 
determine overall treatment effects (genotype or exercise), followed by post 
hoc comparisons between concerned study groups (Statistica V6.0, StatSoft, 
OK). A two-tailed P value of Ͻ0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. 
For indirect calorimetry measurements, ANOVA repeated measures (<rs id="software-3" type="software">Prism</rs>,

<p>interviews. All interviews were conducted by the same 
researcher using a topic list developed according to the prin-
ciples of Kvale. 
49 Recordings were transcribed verbatim by an 
independent transcription service and subsequently compared 
with the audio recordings for completeness and accuracy. 
Both content and thematic analyses were used based on the

50 Interviews were coded by two sepa-
rately working researchers with the use of the data analysis 
software of <rs type="software">Dedoose</rs>, a web-based program for mixed methods

<p>Blood samples were collected for pharmacoki-
netic analysis of evacetrapib before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 
6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 
168 hours after the evacetrapib doses were given 
on days 1 and 14. Plasma samples were analyzed 
for evacetrapib by using a validated liquid chro-
matography with the tandem mass spectrometric 
method at Covance Laboratories Inc. (Madison, 
WI). The lower and upper limits of quantification 
were 1.00 and 1000 ng/ml, respectively. The 
interassay accuracy, defined as the closeness of 
the mean value obtained by the method to the 
actual nominal value of the analyte and expressed 
as a percent, ranged from À2.9 to 1.5% during 
validation. The interassay precision, defined as 
the closeness of repeated individual measures of 
the analyte and expressed as the coefficient of 
variation, ranged from 2.9 to 6.4% during valida-
tion. Both precision and accuracy measures met 
the predefined acceptance criteria consistent with 
regulatory guidances, 
14, 15 thus confirming the 
robustness of the bioanalytical assay. 
The potential for omeprazole to interfere with 
evacetrapib in the bioanalytical assay was 
assessed at an omeprazole concentration of 
650 ng/ml. There was no significant interference 
in the chromatographic regions of interest for 
evacetrapib, indicating that the evacetrapib 
method had acceptable selectivity in the pres-
ence of omeprazole. 
Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for evace-
trapib were calculated by using standard noncom-
partmental methods of analysis using <rs id="software-0" type="software">WinNonlin</rs> 
software, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v.6.2.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Pharsight Corp.</rs>., Mountain 
View, CA). The primary parameters for analysis 
were area under the concentration versus time 
curve (AUC) from time zero to the last time point 
with a measurable concentration (AUC 0-tlast ); 
AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity 
(AUC 0-∞ ); maximum observed drug concentra-
tion (C max ); and the time to reach maximum con-
centration (T max ). The AUC was calculated by 
using a combination of the linear and logarithmic 
trapezoidal methods (linear-log trapezoidal rule). 
The linear trapezoidal method was applied up to 
T max , and then the logarithmic trapezoidal 
method was used after T max . The minimum 
requirement for the calculation of AUC was the 
inclusion of at least three consecutive plasma con-
centrations above the lower level of quantitation, 
with at least one of these concentrations following 
C max . The C max and T max were reported from 
visual inspection of the concentration versus time </p>

analyzed by using SAS procedure <rs type="software">PROC UNI-
VARIATE</rs> software. The median of differences 
and~90% CI for the median of differences be-
tween evacetrapib + omeprazole and evacetrapib 
alone were calculated. The difference in T max 
was considered statistically significant if the 90% 
CI did not contain zero. 
These analyses were repeated for subjects 
whose predose gastric pH was 3.0 or lower on 
day 1 and 4.0 or higher on day 14. </p>

<p>T max analyzed nonparametrically by using SAS procedure <rs type="software">PROC UNIVARIATE</rs> software. </p>

<p>The data from three or four dose-dependent 
experiments were tested by ANOVA followed 
by post-hoc analysis (Duncan test). All analy-
sis performed with <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> software. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. All assays were performed in at least three 
independent experiments and data are presented as the mean + 
standard error of the mean. Statistical analysis was performed 
by one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls multiple 
comparison test, using <rs id="software-0" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.0</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad Software Inc.</rs>., La Jolla, CA, USA). P&lt;0.05 was 
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. </p>

<p>Each motivation factor was marked by employees with 
one of five types of importance for required as well as for cur 
rent conditions. The required condition can be defined as an 
idea of employees how the motivation should look like, i.e. 
what would motivate them to increase their performance. The 
current conditions represents the employees' opinion how 
they are satisfied with current motivation in the enterprise. 
The questionnaires were evaluated using the programme 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">STATISTICA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">7</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">StatSoft</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2004</rs>). Descriptive statistics was used 
to describe the primary sampling unit. Statistical character 
istics, which compressed information about studied primary 
sampling units into smaller number of numerical character 
istics and made mutual comparison of sampling units easier, 
were computed for each motivation factor. Each motivation 
factor was described in summary by basic characteristics of 
size and variability of quantitative features -average x 
 , stand 
ard deviations s x and coefficients of variation. Subsequently 
the results of the enterprises were compared. 
Besides simple comparison of descriptive characteristic 
values, considering the selected type of obtained data, testing 
the equality of averages and standard deviations of primary 
sampling units was carried out. The purpose of testing was 
to verify statistical significance of differences in averages 
and standard deviations of individual motivation factors in 
studied enterprises so that the fact, that detected differences 
of descriptive characteristics at the selected level of signi 
ficance α were not caused only by the mistake made by 
representative sampling, was eliminated. Twosample ttest 
was used to test the equality of averages of motivation factors 
of two primary sampling units (Scheer 2007). When calcula 
ting ttest three cases depending upon the fact whether the 
variances of compared primary sampling units are equal or 
not </p>

<p>High resolution T1-weighted anatomic images were acquired on a GE 3T Excite MRI 
system. Automated reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of images were conducted 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">FreeSurfer</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</rs>/), which is widely used and 
provides accurate renderings of regional volumes without rater bias. We used an imaging 
protocol that maximizes differentiation of the white and gray matter boundary (3D spoiled 
gradient-recalled at steady state, TE 3.0 ms, TR 7.8 ms, TI 600, 8° flip angle, NEX 1, 1-mm 
axial slice thickness, FOV 25.6 cm, 256 × 256 matrix). MRIs for each participant were 
motion corrected, normalized for intensity in homogeneities, and transformed to Talairach 
space. Non-brain tissue was removed using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation 
procedure, subcortical structures were segmented, and further intensity normalization was 
conducted. This was followed by white-matter segmentation, tessellation of the gray-white 
matter boundary, and automated topology correction. Finally, surface deformation following 
intensity gradients optimally placed the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at 
the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue 
class. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into 34 gyral-based regions in each hemisphere 
based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas [33]. Subcortical structures were delineated by an 
algorithm that examines variations in voxel intensities and spatial relationships. Anatomical 
accuracy of the segmentations was manually verified. To account for differences in head 
size, volumes for each region were divided by intracranial volume (ICV). </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were performed with the aid of 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.1</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC,

viation (SD). The normality of data distribution was 
checked. Variables with skewed distributions were log-
transformed prior to analysis. The significance of 
observed between-group differences was assessed using 
the unpaired Student t test and the significance of 
among-group differences was analyzed using one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA). If a statistically signif-
icant effect was noted, Duncan's post-hoc test was 
applied to identify a between-group difference with a 
significance level of p &lt; 0.05. Pearson correlation co-
efficients were calculated to measure the extent of cor-
relation between pairs of variables. </p>

<p>2ϫ30s, 2ϫ120s, 1ϫ180s, and 2ϫ300s). Healthy individuals and MS patients not 
subscribed to VLCD were scanned with [ 
18 F]-FTHA immediately after injec-
tion (frames 3ϫ60s, 1ϫ120s, 5ϫ300s, 2ϫ600s). For MS patients subscribed to 
VLCD, [ 
18 F]-FTHA scanning started 70 min after injection and was static (600 
s). During the scans, arterialized venous blood samples were drawn for the 
determination of plasma radioactivity (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 s, and 2, 3, 
4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 min for both [ 
11 C]-palmitate and [ 
18 F]-FTHA, and 
additional time points of 60, 70, 80, and 90 min for [ 
18 F]-FTHA). Serum FFAs, 
insulin and glucose concentrations were measured at 0, 10, and 30 min after 
the [ 
11 C]-palmitate injection, and 0, 30, 60, and 90 min after the [ 
18 F]-FTHA 
injection. 
Image acquisition, processing, and corrections. Most studies were per-
formed using GE Discovery PET-CT STE (GE, Medical Systems, Milwaukee, 
WI), but because of the short half-life of [ 
11 C]-palmitate, Siemens ECAT HRϩ 
(Knoxville, TN) and GE Advance (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) were 
in use when this tracer was divided. The second study was scanned with same 
camera-protocol as the first study. Data were corrected for dead-time, decay, 
and photon attenuation. PET images were reconstructed in GE Advance using 
a 128 ϫ 128 matrix with a 30-cm field of view (FOV) in three-dimensional (3D) 
mode and Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstruction, in Siemens HRϩ 
using 128 ϫ 128 matrix with zoom two (28.8 cm FOV) in 3D mode and FBP 
reconstruction and in PET-CT using 128 ϫ 128 matrix with 35 cm FOV in 3D 
mode and Iterative Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) recon-
struction (VUEPoint). 
Calculation of the parametric fractional uptake rate image. Brain 
fractional uptake indexes for [ 
11 C]-palmitate and [ 
18 F]-FTHA were calculated 
by dividing the brain radioactivity by the integral of the plasma unmetabolized 
radioactivity curve at 15 min. The modeling gives results that are independent 
of the injected tracer dose. The fractional uptake rate (FUR) image from 
dynamic brain scanning was calculated from 10 -20 min. 
Analysis of PET images. The detailed description of regional and voxel level 
PET image analyses and statistical analyses of regional FUR estimates are 
provided in the online appendix. All values are expressed as mean Ϯ SD. 
P values Ͻ 0.05 are considered statistically significant. 
Biochemical analyses. Details of biochemical analyses are provided in the 
online appendix. 
Statistical analysis of biochemical and anthropometric data. Student t 
test was used in baseline to compare results between MS patients and the 
control group. A paired Student t test was used to compare changes in the MS 
group before and after VLCD. Correlations were analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SAS Enter-
prise Guide 4.1</rs> (4.1.0.471; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC). The normality of variables

were calculated using Pearson correlation, and non-normal Spearman corre-
lation was used. All values are expressed as mean Ϯ SD. P values Ͻ 0.05 are

<p>Statistical analysis 
Descriptive contingency tables were prepared, showing 
demographic characteristics and medical history (age, sex, 
calendar year of perforated diverticular disease diagnosis, 
comorbidities) of corticosteroid users and non-users. 
For time-to-event analyses, the Kaplan-Meier method 
and Cox regression were used. Absolute mortality risks 
in corticosteroid users and non-users were calculated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional 
hazard regression was used to compare mortality rates 
among the predefined categories of corticosteroid users, 
providing HRs for 7-day, 1-month, 3-month and 1-year 
mortality. Stratified analyses were performed according 
to type of surgery within 30 days before or after diagno-
sis of perforated diverticular disease. 
Subgroup analyses were performed to compare mortal-
ity risks among patients taking different forms of corticos-
teroids (inhaled only, intestinal only and systemic only) 
and with different 1-year cumulative doses of systemic cor-
ticosteroid use. Also, sensitivity analyses were performed 
after excluding patients with malignancies, patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease, patients with a previous 
code for diverticular disease and patients with rheumatic 
diseases including mixed connective tissue disease. 
In addition to crude analyses, we performed adjusted 
analyses including the following potential confounders: 
age, sex, use of cardiovascular medications (anticoagulants, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ACE/angiotensin 2 
receptor (A2R) inhibitors, statins, β blockers, calcium 
channel blockers, diuretics, selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) and nitrates) 
16 during the 90 days 
before admission, hypertension, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD; as a proxy for smoking), liver 
disease or chronic pancreatitis, alcoholism-related diseases 
other than those affecting the liver or pancreas, inflamma-
tory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, connective 
tissue disease, malignancies and modified Charlson 
Comorbidity Index score (see online supplementary 
appendix 1 for specification of the codes). The modified 
Charlson Comorbidity Index score was calculated after 
exclusion of COPD, liver diseases, connective tissue disease 
and malignancies. These characteristics and conditions are 
associated with corticosteroid use and constitute potential 
risk factors for mortality.

following the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization was 
performed for 17 h at 60 1C in a rotating hyb oven at a speed 
of 4 rounds per minute (r.p.m.). Washing was performed at 
room temperature following the manufacturer's protocol.

<p>Neuroblastoma single-color profiles 
Single-color gene-expression profiles were generated for 
478/499 neuroblastoma samples of the MAQC-II dual-color 
training and validation set (training set 244/246; validation 
set 234/253). For the remaining 21 samples no single-color 
data was available due to either shortage of tumor material 
of these patients (n ¼ 15), poor experimental quality of the 
generated single-color profiles (n ¼ 5) or correlation of one 
single-color profile to two different dual-color profiles for 
the one patient profiled with both versions of the 2 Â 11K 
microarrays. Single-Color gene-expression profiles were 
generated using customized 4 Â 44K oligonucleotide micro-
arrays produced by Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, 
USA). These 4 Â 44K microarrays included all probes repre-
sented by Agilent's Whole Human Genome Oligo Micro-
array and all probes of the version V2.0 of the 2 Â 11K 
customized microarray that were not present in the former 
probe set. Labeling and hybridization was performed 
following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 1 mg total 
of tumor RNA was linearily amplified and labeled with Cy3 
using Agilent's one-color Quick Amp Labeling Kit following 
the instructions of the protocol. Then, 1650 ng of Cy3-
labeled cRNA was hybridized on the 4 Â 44K arrays using 
Agilent's High-RPM Gene Expression Hyb Kit. Hybridization 
was performed for 17 h at 65 1C in a rotating hyb oven at 
10 r.p.m. according to the company's recommendations.

<p>20 As emphasised by Greif (1994), culture is an equilibrium selection device and so it is interesting to 
consider within this model the role that culture might have played in Russia. Two facts suggest that the ÔgoodÕ 
corner equilibrium, with x 
Ã ¼ 0, would not be a focal point: (a) managers commonly engaged in asset 
stripping well before the mass privatisation of 1992-4 (Grigoriev, 1992) and (b) most beneficiaries of the mass 
privatisation of large state enterprises in Russia were the managers. For instance, Varese (2001, Appendix B), 
finds in his survey of one Russian city in 1993 that 51% of the 92 full-time officials of the Communist Party in 
1988 were top managers of economic enterprises.

L ¼ 0.01, I 
N ¼ 0.0475,g ¼ 1:05,z ¼ 0:9, k ¼ 0.3, and d ¼ 0.945. Using (4), these values imply 
h max ¼ 0.8. The <rs id="software-0" type="software">EXCEL</rs> program is available at <rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://www.econ.worldbank.org/staff/khoff</rs>. 
24 One can show by standard methods that given a transition probability p per period, the expected 
number of periods before reform is 1/p. If x 
Ã ¼ 0.75, then p(x

periods. 
25 When x 
Ã ¼ 0.75, 87% of agents build value (the marginal asset-stripper demands the rule of law). To 
compute aggregate income, we assume that each agent has control rights over an equal share of aggregate 
assets. This implies that the fraction of agents who strip assets equals the fraction of assets that are stripped. </p>

and <rs id="software-0" type="software">Volocity</rs> imaging software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">PerkinElmer</rs>) and searched for 
the expression of feline neutrophil elastase and Campylobacter. 
Images were taken when a field of view (9400 objective) con-
tained a neutrophil elastase expressor and one or both of the 
Campylobacter expressors. A record was made of any neutrophil 
elastase expressors that did not have a Campylobacter expressor 
in the same field, as well as the overall presence of C. jejuni and 
thermophilic Campylobacter. <rs id="software-1" type="software">Image J</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</rs>) was used after images had been captured to

tance was measured in pixels on the digital images. The maxi-
mum field size used was 1850 pixels. The use of this software

<p>Background: This study systematically compared the efficacy and safety of simultaneous 
hepatectomy and splenectomy (HS) with hepatectomy (H) alone in patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) and hypersplenism. 
Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library 
databases were systematically searched by two independent researchers through to March 31, 
2015 to identify relevant studies. All the extracted literature were managed by Bibliographic 
citation management software. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using 
a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale judgment. The data were analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">RevMan</rs><rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5.2</rs> 
software. 
Results: Eight studies including a total of 761 patients with HCC and hypersplenism (360 in 
the HS group, 401 in the H group) were finally included in the analysis. Outcomes, including 
postoperative complications, perioperative mortality, operation time, 5-year survival rate, and 
need for blood transfusion did not differ significantly between the two groups. HS was associ-
ated with significantly more intraoperative bleeding (mean difference [MD] 57.15, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 18.83-95.46, P=0.003), and CD4/CD8 ratio (MD 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.77, 
P,0.00001), CD4 subset, platelet count (MD 213.06, 95% CI 202.59-223.53, P,0.0001), 
white blood cell count (MD 4.85, 95% CI 4.58-5.13, P,0.0001), interferon-gamma levels 
(MD 18.52, 95% CI 13.93-23.11, P,0.00001), and interleukin-2 levels (MD 20.73, 95% CI 
16.05-25.41, P,0.0001). In addition, lower CD8 subset (MD -7.85, 95% CI -9.07, -6.63, 
P,0.00001) and interleukin-10 levels (MD -18.56, 95% CI -22.61, -14.50, P,0.00001) were 
observed for HS. 
Conclusion: We identified that simultaneous HS do not increase postoperative complications, 
operation time, or perioperative mortality in patients with HCC and hypersplenism. Simultane-
ous splenectomy can increase postoperative white blood cell and platelet counts significantly, 
improve blood coagulation, reduce the incidence of postoperative bleeding, and enhance immu-
nity. Therefore, HS is safe, effective, and feasible for patients with HCC and hypersplenism. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor and the third leading 
cause of tumor-related death worldwide.

treatment for HCC, which is often complicated by splenomegaly and hypersplenism.

<p>The data were analyzed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">RevMan</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">5.2</rs> software. We 
analyzed dichotomous variables using odds ratios (ORs) 
or risk differences along with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs), and analyzed continuous data using mean differences 
(MDs) along with 95% CIs. The I 
2 and P-value were used 
for evaluation of heterogeneity. A fixed-effects model was 
used when the heterogeneity test showed better homogeneity 
(P.0.1). 
10,11 Otherwise, a random-effects model was used. 
With regard to outcomes when significant heterogeneity 
existed across studies, sensitivity analysis was conducted 
by respectively omitting each study to explore the influence 
of each individual study on the merged data. </p>

<p>Simple regression models included the matching factors: age 
and region of residence. Multivariate regression models 
additionally included education, smoking, BMI, energy intake, 
physical activity, history of diabetes and family history of 
prostate cancer. Potential confounders were selected based 
on subject matter knowledge as well as on indications pro-
vided by purely statistical procedures, such as a change in 
β-coefficients (&gt;10 %). Other covariates that were considered 
as potential confounders but not included in the final model 
were height, employment status, marital status, snuff use, 
use of dietary supplements, use of olive oil and intake of cof-
fee, phyto-oestrogens, potatoes, sweet foods and non-alcoholic 
beverages. The potential effect measure modification by 
selected covariates (age, family history of prostate cancer, his-
tory of diabetes and BMI) was evaluated in two ways: formal 
interaction tests by including multiplicative interaction terms in 
logistic regression models, and by the use of interaction indi-
cator variables to obtain a stratified effect. 
Wald and likelihood ratio tests were used to assess the stat-
istical significance of observed associations (P &lt; 0·05, two-
sided tests). The fit of the models was evaluated by the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow and the Pearson χ 
2 goodness-of-fit 
tests. All analyses were performed using the statistical software 
systems <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>.) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 12</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">StataCorp LP</rs>). </p>

Data analysis and statistics 
Experiments were performed three times in 
triplicate. Data was expressed either as percentages of non-
treated controls (individual testing) or as percentages of the 
signal observed for 30 pM E 2 (testing mixtures NFLX-E 2 ). 
The normality of the distribution of data was tested with 
the Shapiro-Wilk test (p&lt;0.05). To compare data, 1-way 
ANOVA was applied to normally distributed data, followed 
by Dunnett's Multiple Comparison post hoc test. For 
data that were not normally distributed we used Kruskal-
Wallis test, followed by Dunnett's Multiple Comparison 
test. Differences in P values of &lt;0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. All statistical analyses and graphs 
were performed using <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad</rs> <rs id="software-0" type="software">Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5</rs>. </p>

<p>To test the methodology, a pre-test was performed in a 
sample of 30 adolescents, whose characteristics were similar 
to those of the study population. Absenteeism was 
measured daily and was defined as being when a student 
failed to carry out the scheduled mouthrinsing or did not 
attend the final clinical examination. 
Both dental examinations were carried out by the same 
examiner (ARDG). After the second dental examination, all 
new tooth staining that had not been registered at the first 
examination was recorded. The examiner did not know to 
which group the adolescents belonged. 
The Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests were used 
to assess differences in variables between the two groups 
at baseline and at the end of the trial. The differences 
between proportions were tested using the chi-square test 
and comparison in the perception of tooth staining was 
analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Significance was 
established when p&lt;0.05. The <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> software package (SPSS, 
Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used for the data analysis. </p>

µg/kg BW, ip), hypoglycemic (2DG; Sigma; 400 mg/kg BW, 
ip) or restraint (1 hr) stresses were applied to rats. Animals 
were divided into 2 groups and given a selective COX-2 in-
hibitor (NS-398; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.A.; 
10 mg/kg BW, ip) or vehicle (DMSO; Sigma) 30 min before 
stress application. Just before stress application (0 min) and 
30 and 120 min after the start of stress application, animals 
were decapitated, and the whole brain was removed and 
fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS; 0.02 M, pH 7.2). 
Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos: Brains were further 
fixed for 48 hr at 4°C in the fixative paraformaldehyde 
solution and then submerged in 10% sucrose solution over-
night, 20% sucrose solution for 24 hr and 30% sucrose for 
48 hr until the brain completely sank. Brain sections of 30 
µm thickness were cut using a cryostat (Microm HM550, 
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) and collected 
serially in 24-well plates containing PBS (0.02 M, pH 7.2). 
One out of every eight slices was used for immunostaining 
for c-Fos protein. Free-floating sections were rinsed with 
PBS for 10 min three times. Sections were then incubated 
with 0.3% H 2 O 2 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature 
and rinsed with PBS for 10 min three times. Thereafter, sec-
tions were incubated in blocking solution (Block Ace, Snow 
Brand Milk Products Co., Sapporo, Japan) for 2 hr. Tissue 
sections were incubated in rabbit anti-Fos primary antibody 
(1:5,000 dilution with 0.02 M PBS containing 1% BSA and 
0.3% Triton X-100; Ab-5, Oncogene Research Product, Cal-
biochem, MA, U.S.A.) at 4°C for 60 hr, washed three times 
with 0.02 M PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 (0.03% 
PBST), and then, the sections were incubated with the 
biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody IgG (1:800 
dilution with 0.02 M PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100; 
Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) at room tem-
perature for 2 hr. Sections were then rinsed three times with 
0.03% PBST and incubated at room temperature for a further 
2 hr with an avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex 
solution (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories). Finally, 
sections were treated for approximately 1.5 min in 0.5 mg/ 
ml diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma,; dissolved 
in 0.02 M PBS with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and 0.25% 
nickel chloride). The sections were mounted on slides, air 
dried, dehydrated in ethanol solutions and xylene, and cov-
erslipped. 
Quantification of c-Fos immunoreactive cells: Brain 
regions were identified using the rat brain in stereotaxic 
coordinates [19]. The number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (IR) 
cells in the PVN and SON was counted using an Olympus 
Optical System (BX-51, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Ja-
pan), and the digitized images were analyzed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">IPLab</rs> 
image analyzing software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Scanalytics Corp.</rs>., Fairfax, VA, 
U.S.A.). A threshold was set to delineate c-Fos-positive 
stained nuclei from background, and only cells above the 
threshold were included. Up to four sections per animal for 
each region were quantified bilaterally and then averaged. 
Statistical analyses: All statistical analyses were per-
formed in <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">11.5 Version</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, </p>

<p>Data are expressed as mean ± standard devia-
tion. Data were checked for normal distribution 
before analysis using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
Fisher's post hoc test, and simple regression analy-
sis were used as appropriate. A value of p &lt; 0.05 
was considered significant. All statistics were per-
formed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">StatView</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.0</rs> software for Macintosh

<p>21. For the variance ratio test, I used the <rs type="software">Stata</rs> command 
sdtest. The null hypothesis of this test is that the ratio r = 
σ 2 </p>

<p>equals 1, i.e. H 0 : r = 1. The calculated test statistic 
is f = 0.6605, which is distributed as F (32172,27221) , where 
the degrees of freedom in the numerator and denominator 
are (n FS − 1) and (n IS − 1), respectively. This null is rejected 
against the alternative H 1 : r &lt; 1 with a p value of 0.0000, and 
against the alternative H 1 : r ≠ 1 with a p value of 0.0000, but 
cannot be rejected against the alternative H 1 : r &gt; 1 with a p 
value of 1.0000. 
22. To test the hypothesis of equal variances, I used the 
<rs type="software">Stata</rs> command robvar which provides three alternative test 
statistics that vary the measure of central tendency used to 
calculate the test. The first one uses the mean of each group 
under comparison, the second uses the median of each group, 
and the third uses the 10% trimmed mean of each group. 
The first variant of the test is the one proposed by Levene 
(1960), the other two are the ones proposed by Brown and </p>

<p>PLINK 1.07 (Purcell et al., 2007). After the quality control, 
53,257 SNPs were retained for further analysis. GWAS 
analyses on plumage coloration of whole body and the body 
parts traits were performed using mixed model of <rs id="software-0" type="software">GEMMA</rs>

population stratification and sample structure. </p>

<p><rs type="software">GEMMA</rs> tests the alternative hypothesis H 1 :0 against the 
null hypothesis H 0 : = 0 for each SNP. To correct for 
multiple hypothesis testing, we obtained adjusted p values 
by using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate 
procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), adjusted 
p-value 0.2 significance level is used. An overview of the 
test results was shown as a Manhattan plot constructed by 
the statistical package R. Base pair position of SNP markers 
were given based on the chicken genome assembly build 
WASHUC2. Inflation factor was calculated by the R 
package GenABEL with "median" option (Aulchenko et al., 
2007). </p>

significance level (Figure 2, Table 2). As genomic inflation 
factor is 0.987, it can be concluded that the GWAS result is 
not inflated by considering relatedness using <rs type="software">GEMMA</rs> 
(Figure 3). Among the significant SNPs, we identified 4 
susceptibility SNPs: rs14339964 (Gga3:36327458, p = 4.07 
10 
-9 ), GGaluGA344987 (Gga3:705798, p = 1.1210

<p>Statistical analysis 
Data were analysed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">PASW</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.18.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>.). 
Descriptive statistics were used for demographic data. 
Continuous values reported were medians and ranges 
due to the large spread of the data. Categorical variables 
were 
reported 
as 
counts 
and 
percentages. 
Non-parametric Mann-Whitney or Cross tabulation and 
Pearson's χ 
2 were performed to compare groups. The 
probability of remaining ventilated between groups was 
analysed using survival analysis. Adherence to guidelines 
was reported in counts and percentages. The influence 
of diagnostic group on guideline adherence was ana-
lysed using Pearson's correlation and comparison of 
means using Student t test. Survey responses were 
reported in counts and percentages as well as significant 
themes derived from qualitative data. </p>

<p>a method reported previously (Mori et al., 2008). This method 
yielded B-ring-modified esters as the major products except linole-
nate ester (C18TE). In case of synthesis of saturated fatty acid 
monoesters, the ratio of regioisomers was consistent regard-
less of the alkyl chain length. Unsaturated fatty acid esters 
and dioctanoyl esters (C8 × 2) were also synthesized, and the 
ratio of their regioisomers is summarized in Table 1. Mix-
tures of these isomers were used without isolation because 
they have similar chemical properties and the antiviral activ-
ities of these mixtures did not vary with their composition 
ratio (Mori et al., 2008). Log P values were calculated by a

<p>themes/codes: MPOWER focus area (monitor, protect, 
offer, warn, enforce, raise taxes); type of news item 
( press release, correspondence, feature articles, column, 
editorial, others); institutional system of tobacco control 
under focus (sensitisation/advocacy, awareness gener-
ation/information education and communication, legis-
lation and enforcement, stakeholder engagement and 
capacity building of stakeholders); intent of news item 
(anti or protobacco); type of tobacco and age/gender 
focus. These predetermined codes were identified after 
brainstorming among the investigators. We also looked 
for tobacco industry (TI) interference (TII) and related 
issues like illicit trade and corporate social responsibil-
ities (CSR). We also collected information on year of 
publication; name and language of newspaper. Coding 
was done by the same staff that collected the print news 
item. They received training for coding from the union 
technical advisor (RJS). The coding process was ran-
domly supervised (10% of print news items) by the 
supervisors at the state headquarters. 
For objective 6, a cost description was undertaken to 
find out the hypothetical value of this earned print 
media. The area of the news item in cm 
2 was multi-
plied by the average rate of space per cm 
2 for a paid 
news item in that particular newspaper during the 
year 2007 to 2014 (obtained in Indian rupee (INR) 
from the offices of the newspapers). The hypothetical 
value of earned print media in INR was converted to 
US$ at the average monthly value of US$ between 
2008 and 2014 as the conversion factor. (US$1=INR 
51.84).

(ANOVA) and one-way repeated ANOVA for repeated data 
were conducted. The aim of the one-way ANOVA was to 
compare the averages of several physiological parameters 
relative to the groups; a difference in the mean physiologi-
cal parameter values of the three groups would result in a 
statistical difference between subjects classified as hetero-
schematic male, isoschematic, and heteroschematic female. 
Accordingly, the calculated P-value would be less than the

PFS and OS. All time intervals were measured in relation to the 
commencement of BRAF inhibitor. Follow-up for patients who 
subsequently received dabrafenib and trametinib combination 
(CombiDT) therapy (n ¼ 5) was censored at date of cross-over to 
CombiDT therapy, as response rates of 19% and a median PFS of 
3.6 months have been reported in this patient population (Flaherty 
et al, 2011). Follow-up for one patient who discontinued therapy 
after best response but before progressive disease was censored at 
date of BRAF inhibitor cessation. Multivariate survival models 
were also tested for PFS and OS in the overall cohort adjusting for 
age, sex, presence of active (untreated, or previously treated but 
relapsed) brain metastases (BM), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status and ongoing treatment with BRAF inhibitor after RECIST-
defined disease progression. Pearson's correlation and Mann-
Whitney U-methods were used to test all staining parameters for 
association with best CT response in terms of best per cent change 
(sum of diameters target lesions baseline to best response) and also 
coded categorically as a partial response; no patient experienced a 
complete response. A subgroup response and survival correlate 
analysis was conducted excluding patients who had BM at trial

<p>sampled at Punta Prieta, Ensenada, Baja California (29.063 ° N, 114.155 ° W). 
Duplicate samples of each individual were stored in 96% ethanol at the Labo-
ratorio de Genética para la Conservación at CIBNOR . PCR reactions were 
performed, as described above, using optimized primer-specifi c annealing 
temperatures ( Table 1 ), magnesium chloride, and forward-labeled primers 
(5 ′ end-labeled with FAM, NED, PET, and VIC; Applied Biosystems). Individu-
als were genotyped by assessing allele size on a genetic analyzer (model 310, 
Applied Biosystems), using the GeneScan 600 LIZ Size Standard (<rs corresp="#software-12" type="creator">Applied Biosystems</rs>) and <rs id="software-12" type="software">GeneMapper</rs> <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">4.1</rs> software (Applied Biosystems). 
Locus designation, primer sequences, repeat motifs, annealing temperatures, 
PCR product sizes, and GenBank accession numbers are listed in Table 1 . All 
10 loci were polymorphic, exhibiting two to 10 alleles per locus (mean A = 5.5) 
among cacti from El Comitán, and two to seven alleles per locus (mean A = 3.7) 
among cacti from Punta Prieta. Alleles per individual plant ranged from one to 
four in both populations, suggesting a polyploidal genome ( Table 2 ) . 
Observed heterozygosity was estimated in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Cor-
poration, Redmond, Washington, USA). Expected heterozygosity was esti-
mated in <rs type="software">ATETRA</rs> software for tetraploid species that account for all possible 
combinations of allele copy numbers in populations with partial heterozygotes 
( Van Puyvelde et al., 2010 ). Genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity varied 
from low to high across loci in both populations. Observed heterozygosity 
ranged from 0.13 to 0.78 (mean H o = 0.59) and expected heterozygosity ranged 
from 0.37 to 0.77 (mean H e = 0.57) at El Comitán. At Punta Prieta, observed 
heterozygosity ranged from 0.03 to 0.85 (mean H o = 0.41) and expected 
heterozygosity ranged from 0.03 to 0.72 (mean H e = 0.40) ( Table 2 ). For this 
study, we assumed tetraploidy in both populations because we observed as 
many as four alleles per locus in individual plants. Our results are also consis-
tent with a tetrasomic pattern of inheritance previously suggested in P. pringlei , 
based on an allozymatic study ( Murawski et al., 1994 ) and a chromosome 
counting study ( Pinkava et al., 1973 ). </p>

<p>Abstract. [Purpose] This study was conducted to provide basic data for solutions to reduce the turnover rate of 
physical therapists. It should help create efficient personnel and organization management by exploring the impact 
of the work environment and work-related stress on turnover intention and analyzing the correlation between them. 
[Subjects and Methods] A survey was conducted with 236 physical therapists working at medical institutions in the 
Daejeon and Chungcheong areas. For the analysis on the collected data, correlational and linear regression analy-
ses were conducted using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18.0</rs> program and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. [Results] The results showed 
a statistically significant positive correlation between turnover intention and work-related stress but a statistically 
significant negative correlation respectively between turnover intention and work environment. Work-related stress 
(β=0.415) had a significant positive impact on turnover intention and work environment (β=−0.387) had a signifi-
cant negative impact on turnover intention. [Conclusion] To increase satisfaction level with the profession as well 
as the workplace for physical therapists, improvement of the work environment was the most necessary primary 
improvement. 
Due to the nature of the job, physical therapists provide medical services in close relationships with patients 1, 2) . The 
turnover of physical therapists is a major loss in quality improvement of health services and rehabilitation related to human 
resources 3) . 
Currently, medical services are moving from healthcare provider-centered to patient-centered and hospitals are also con-
verting into patient-centered healthcare systems 4) . In addition, hospital organizations are recognizing recruitment, training, 
and retraining for healthcare providers in each specialized field 5) . 
To provide good quality health services, healthcare providers' beliefs in significantly contributing to patient care and 
their own work satisfaction should be preceded 5) . Emotional labor refers to the idea of suppressing and limiting emotions to 
satisfy hospitals' changing patient-centered goals and patients' feelings 6, 7) . A physical therapist is a representative emotional 
laborer 8) . Stress caused by excessive emotional labor has a negative effect on workers' commitment to the organization and 
satisfaction toward the job 9, 10) , resulting in work-related stress (WS). The work environment (WE) of human service workers 
has also been presented as a major factor in turnovers 11) . 
If an organization member leaves the organization due to turnover, ensuring good quality staffing is threatened; large 
amounts of money are spent in the selection and training of new staff, finally resulting in loss to the organization 12) . Ad-
ditionally, new employees are highly likely to make mistakes or cause accidents compared to employees with experience. </p>

<p>The study participants were 241 physical therapists currently working in medical institutions who were directly visited 
during the three months from January to March 2014 for questionnaire distribution and collection. Five questionnaires were 
miswritten due to error or insufficient survey answer contents; 236 questionnaires were examined statistically. All subjects 
provided written informed consent prior to participation in this study. Those who fully comprehended the study procedure 
and voluntarily agreed to participate were selected as participants. This study was conducted consistent with the principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The TI measurement tool used seven questions; for turnover factors, four questions modified and used by Gang 20) were 
modified and reconstructed for this study. The tool is composed of 11 questions. To measure WS, this study used the question-
naire consisting of 15 questions after modifying and complementing the method used by Byun 13) . The WE measurement tool 
was reconstructed for this study based on the survey tool reconstructed by Lim 21) . WE was measured with a questionnaire 
of 26 questions. Each question on the measurement tool was based on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (strongly agree) 
points and higher scores meant better WE. Cronbach's alpha values in a previous and the present study were more than 0.700. 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">18.0</rs> was used for the collected data and the analysis method is as follows. Participants' general characteristics were 
shown as frequency and percentage. TI, WS, and WE of the participants were obtained as means and standard deviations. The 
data were analyzed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient to verify the reliability of questionnaire internal consistencies. The 
correlation between TI, WS, and WE used correlation analysis through Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression 
analysis to determine the impact of WS and WE on TI 2) . The significance level of this study was set as 0.05. </p>

Retrospectively, we analyzed the purified mononuclear cell 
fractions of the first (MDS-diagnosed) and second (ALL-diag-
nosed) BM specimens using microarray analysis, <rs type="software">Affymetrix 
Cytogenetics Whole Genome 2.7 Mb Array</rs> (Affymetrix, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA) to identify genetic abnormalities. In the first 
BM sample, no chromosomal or genetic abnormalities were 
observed. However, in the second BM sample, we found several 
large interstitial deletions of 27 Mb and 5.7 Mb on 5q21.2q31.1 
and 13q14.1q21.1, respectively, and many microdeletions on 
chromosomes 5q, 12q, 13q, and 22q. Particularly, a partial ho-
mozygous loss of 200 kb was observed in a region of heterozy-
gous loss on chromosome 13q14.1q21.1 in the second BM 
sample. The chromosome views of the second BM sample us-
ing cytogenetic microarray analysis are shown in Fig. 3. To con-
firm this result, additional FISH analysis of the second BM sam-
ple was performed using 2 probes for EGR1 (5q31) and RB1 
(13q14), and produced the same result: 5q31.2 was not deleted 
and 13q14.3 was deleted in 84% of the examined nuclei (Fig. 4). </p>

<p>METHODS 
Medicare is Australia's publically funded universal health 
insurance scheme. A comprehensive range of services, 
diagnostic procedures and tests is itemised as the Medicare 
Benefits Schedule (MBS). Every public or private patient 
in the ambulatory setting receives a reimbursement via 
Medicare for services provided by General Practitioners 
(GPs) or specialists. Analysis of MBS data provides informa-
tion on patterns and trends in healthcare utilisation. 
The MBS was analysed by using specific item numbers 
for 25(OH)D testing, bone densitometry (dual energy 
x-ray absorptiometry) and a commonly requested refer-
ence test, full blood count (FBC). The latter was used as 
a control for pathology test utilisation as it is unlikely to 
have been influenced by topical health trends. For indi-
viduals who had one to five tests, we used analysis of vari-
ance adjusting for multiple comparisons using 
Bonferroni post hoc tests to determine whether there 
was a significant difference in the mean number of indi-
viduals being tested each year by quarter (not including 
duplicate tests) for each test frequency. All analyses were 
performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.19.0.1</rs> ( <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">July 2010</rs>). </p>

<p>and normalized to an OD 600 of 1.0. PCR with differential PAK1, GPA1, 
and Ste20 primers was used for determination of serotype and mating type 
as previously described (68). 
Ex vivo antigen stimulation. Antigens were prepared from the cell 
wall and culture supernatants of six strains, including the control H99 
strain and five strains representative of the mean CRAG data points within 
each of the MLST clonal cluster genotypic groups. A capsule antigen prep-
aration was prepared from culture supernatant from each strain grown in 
DMEMϩC. The supernatant was decanted, frozen at Ϫ80°C, and lyoph-
ilized. The lyophilized sample was reconstituted in phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS), and the CRAG titer was measured. A cell wall antigen prep-
aration was prepared from the yeasts. The cells were flash frozen in liquid 
nitrogen, combined with glass beads, and vortexed vigorously for 2 h at 
4°C to disrupt the cells. The insoluble fraction (i.e., cell wall) was analyzed 
for CRAG and for protein (BCA protein assay [BCA stands for bicin-
choninic acid]; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) concentrations. 
Endotoxin levels in all antigen preparations were undetectable (Ͻ0.06 U/ 
ml) by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, East 
Falmouth, MA). 
Whole-blood samples for the cryptococcal cytokine release assay were 
obtained from healthy individuals in North America. Peripheral blood 
samples from each subject were drawn into lithium heparin tubes, diluted 
2-fold with PBS, and dispensed into a tissue culture plate. Cell wall and 
capsule antigens were added to each well to yield a physiologically com-
parable glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) CRAG titer of 1:256. PBS was used 
as the negative control. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 
20 h. After incubation, the plasma was separated from the cells and stored 
at 4°C until cytokine analysis. Cytokines were quantified in duplicate for 
interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), gamma interferon (IFN-␥), and tu-
mor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣) using a Luminex 100 instrument (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA). Negative controls incubated in PBS were subtracted 
from the raw data to determine the net response. 
Statistics. The means for groups of isolates were compared by analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) and t tests, and medians were compared using 
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests and Mann-Whitney U tests. The chi-square 
and Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate the frequencies of categorical 
variables. Tukey adjustments were made to correct for multiple compar-
isons. The Mantel-Cox log rank test was used to compare survival data. All 
analyses were performed with <rs id="software-2" type="software">SAS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., Cary, NC). </p>

<p>Glucosinolate assay 
Seedlings were harvested 1, 3, and 5 d after treatment. Glucosinolates 
were extracted and analysed as previously described, with minor 
modifications (Sun et al., 2011a, b). Fresh tissues (100 mg) were boiled 
in 1 ml of water for 10 min. After recovery of the liquid, the residues 
were washed with water (1 ml), and the combined aqueous extract 
was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (30 mg) column (pyridine 
acetate form). The column was washed three times with 20 mM pyri-
dine acetate and twice with water. The glucosinolates were converted 
into their desulpho analogues by overnight treatment with 100 µl 
of 0.1% (1.4 U) aryl sulphatase, and the desulphoglucosinolates 
were eluted with 2 × 0.5 ml of water. The high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed using Shimadzu 
HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), consisting of two LC-20AT sol-
vent delivery units, a DGU-20A3 degasser, a CTO-10ASVP column 
oven, an SIL-20A autosampler, and an SPD-M20A diode array 
detector. The HPLC system was connected to a computer with <rs id="software-0" type="software">LC

ticle size, 4.6 mm×250 mm; Elite Analytical Instruments Co. Ltd, 
Dalian, China) was used with a mobile phase of acetonitrile and 
water at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> package program 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 11.5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). For Figs 1-3, and 
Supplementary Figs S1, S2, and S4-S6 at JXB online, differences in 
glucosinolate accumulation among different treatments were tested, 
while differences in Fig. 5A were tested among different mutants. 
They all were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
followed by the least significant difference (LSD) test at a 95% con-
fidence level (P &lt; 0.05). For Figs 6A, B, 7A, and Supplementary 
Fig. S3, differences in glucosinolate accumulation among different 
mutants were analysed using independent-samples t-test. The values 
are reported as means with standard error for all results. </p>

<p>The data were analyzed through the equations already 
introduced in this paper. To investigate the association 
between comprehending the instruction for crosswise 
model and the trust of respondents in it, Chi-square test 
was used. All calculations were performed through <rs type="software">Excel</rs> 
and <rs type="software">R-package</rs>. </p>

<p>First we calculate the descriptive statistics for all independent variables for the total sample, 
as well as two subsamples: those who never experienced a pregnancy scare, and those who 
experienced a pregnancy scare (Table 2). Independent samples' t-tests indicate whether the 
independent variables are statistically different in the two subsamples. Next we investigate 
these characteristics in a multivariate context, using logistic regression for models of 
experiencing any pregnancy scare, and Poisson regression for models of the number of 
pregnancy scares (Table 3). Lastly, we estimate hazard models, implemented using logistic 
regression, to illustrate the relationship between a pregnancy scare and subsequent 
unintended pregnancy (Table 4). All analyses were conducted in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">12.1</rs> using the logit, 
poisson, and xtlogit commands. The hazard models were estimated with xtlogit to account 
for the clustering effect of multiple journals per respondent. </p>

with the instructions, complete an accompanying set of control questions and 
participate in two non-paying practice rounds (see the ''supplementary Appendix'' 
for the translated instructions). The experiment itself included 10 rounds. All

Israeli Shekels (NIS) at the end of the experiment at a conversion rate of 15 ECU = 
1 NIS. The final payoff consisted of the payoff of one randomly chosen round in 
addition to a show-up fee of 25 NIS. The average payment including show-up fee 
was 73.33 NIS (approximately 21 USD). Average session duration was 
approximately 120 min. </p>

<p>Double immunofluorescence. Double-label immunofluores-
cence was used to determine the specific type of Syn present 
in the cells. Sections from an elderly individual were incubated 
with rabbit anti-Syn polyclonal antibody (15) and mouse mono-
clonal anti-NF antibody (1:500), mouse monoclonal anti-S100 
protein antibody (1:500; cat. no. MAB-0697; Maxim Biotech, 
Inc.) or mouse monoclonal anti-N-Syn antibody (1:500) at 4˚C, 
overnight. 
Sections were then incubated for 2 h (at room temperature) 
with biotinylated horse anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) G 
(1:500; cat no. PK-4002; ABC kits; Vector Laboratories, Inc., 
Burlingame, CA, USA), followed by Cy3-conjugated goat 
anti-horse IgG (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 
and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG 
(1:200; cat no. ZLI-9021; OriGene Technologies, Inc., China). 
All staining experiments were performed with the 
appropriate positive and negative controls. A series of slides 
containing tissues with a previously established positive reac-
tion with the primary antibodies were used as the positive 
control. To account for nonspecific staining, sections incubated 
without the primary antibody were used as the negative control. 
Sections were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus 
BX51; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Colocalization 
of staining was visualized using image analysis software 
(<rs id="software-1" type="software">Image Pro Plus</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Media Cybernetics, Inc.</rs>., Rockville, MD, 
USA) by applying the Boolean operator 'AND'. This operator 
combined individual unmixed images into a novel image that 
consisted solely of colocalized (double-stained) pixels, thus 
representing only double-stained cells (yellow). The relative 
intensities of NF, S-100, Syn, N-Syn within individual cells 
were determined by <rs type="software">Image Pro Plus</rs> software by measuring 
the integral optical densities (IOD) of 80-100 cells that were 
sampled from each subject randomly (16) </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as the mean ± stan-
dard deviation. The Kruskal-Wallis test by ranks followed by the 
Mann-Whitney test was used to rank the Syn-immunoreactivity 
data. One-way analysis of variance followed by the 
Student-Newman-Keuls test was used for the comparisons 
of NF-positive neurons. Pearson correlations/Spearman's 
rank order correlation was used to evaluate the correlations 
between the neuronal counts and Syn-immunoreactivity cell 
numbers. Data were analyzed with <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">20.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">IBM SPSS</rs>, Armonk, NY, USA). P&lt;0.05 was considered to indicate

determined for each year. Regressions on the number of class-
wise treated episodes were used to examine trends over time.

<p>Statistical analyses. The main dependent variable was the 
occurrence of solid organ cancers that were recorded in 
the Catastrophic Illness Registry. Patients were followed until the 
development of solid cancer, death, dropout from the NHI 
programme, or the end of 2011. Risk of SM in the HSCT cohort 
was calculated as the standardised incidence ratio (SIR), defined as 
the observed number of SM occurrence divided by the expected 
number of cases. The expected number was determined by 
multiplying the national incidence rate (in 5-year intervals) of 
same cancers stratified by gender, calendar year, and age, by the 
corresponding stratum-specific person-time accrued in this cohort. 
Incidence rates of cancers in the general population were obtained 
from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the SIRs were estimated under the assumption that the 
number of cancers followed a Poisson probability distribution. We 
determined the SIRs for subgroups defined by age at HSCT, sex, 
follow-up time since HSCT, and stem cell type. In addition, the SIR 
was estimated for each SM subtype. 
Physical comorbidities before HSCT, immunosuppressant use, 
and cGVHD development were analysed to determine hazard 
ratios for SM. Categorical variables were compared by Fisher's 
exact or chi-square tests. Continuous variables were compared with 
the Mann-Whitney U-test. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models were utilised to identify predictors 
of SM in HSCT patients. All factors with a P-value of o0.1 in the 
univariate analyses were included in the Cox multivariate analysis. 
Effects of immunosuppressant use after HSCT were treated as 
time-dependent variables to prevent an immortal time bias. 
Furthermore, if one type of immunosuppressant had a significant 
effect on SM in the Cox multivariate model, the effects of 
cumulative doses were estimated by time-dependent Cox propor-
tional hazards models using cutoff points at non-use and the 50th 
percentile.

<p>Aliquots of the different transcription complexes (quasi-IC, 
upstream labeled quasi-IC, IC, upstream and downstream-
labeled IC, EC, upstream and downstream labeled EC, 
spRNAPIV elongation complex (EC) and downstream 
labeled spRNAPIV EC) were applied onto previously 
glow-discharged carbon-coated copper/rhodium grids and 
stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were recorded under 
minimal-dose conditions on Kodak SO-163 film, in a JEOL 
JEM1200EXII microscope operated at 100 kV and 60 000 
magnification. Micrographs were digitized using a ZEISS 
scanner with the step size of 14 m, resulting in a pixel size 
of 2.33Å. 
For cryoEM, aliquots of IC and EC were applied onto 
glow-discharged, holey carbon grids (carbon-coated Quan-
tifoil R 1.2/ R1.3 300 mesh grids) containing an additional 
continuous thin layer of carbon, and plunged into liquid 
ethane. Images were acquired under minimal dose condi-
tions with a Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope 
at 200 kV. The images were taken at magnification of ∼110 
000 using a 16 megapixel (Mpx) FEI Eagle CCD camera 
with a step size of 15 m, thus the original pixel size of 
the acquired images was 1.37Å. Cryo-EM micrographs 
were downsampled by a factor of 2 or 3 (EC and IC, re-
spectively). The contrast transfer function of the each ac-
quired image was estimated using <rs id="software-6" type="software">CTFFIND</rs><rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">3</rs> program 
(16) and corrected at the micrograph level. Individual par-
ticles were selected manually and extracted using XMIPP 
software (17) (Supplementary Figure S2A). Two types 
of free-pattern maximum-likelihood multi-reference refine-
ment approaches ('<rs type="software">Maximum Likelihood 2D' (ML2D</rs>) (18) 
(Supplementary Figure S2B) and '<rs type="software">Clustering 2D' (CL2D</rs>) 
(19)) were carried out with normalized particles. Homoge-
neous populations were obtained and averaged for a final 
two-dimensional (2D) characterization. 
Several starting reference models and initial 3D recon-
struction steps based on iterative angular refinement were 
performed using the <rs type="software">EMAN</rs> software package (20). In gen-
eral the initial volumes were created upon the class aver-
ages generated in the previous step, using a common lines 
approach or by using artificial noisy models and Gaussian 
blobs with the rough dimensions of the protein complexes. 
In the case of the streptavidin labeled complexes and those 
complexes analyzed by cryo-EM, the previously obtained 
EM maps of non-labeled or negatively-stained complexes 
were filtered to 70Å, and used as the initial models. The dif-
ferent strategies converged to similar solutions, and one of 
the models was selected to complete the refinement (Supple-
mentary Figure S2C). However, in the case of heterogeneity 
(EC cryo-EM; streptavidin-biotin labeled ICs) the most sta-
ble model was subjected to maximum likelihood 3D classifi-
cation (<rs type="software">ML3D</rs>) (18) to address this problem. The separated </p>

<p>particles were processed using <rs type="software">EMAN</rs> and the whole 3D re-
construction cycle was repeated de novo. The resolution of 
the reconstructions was determined by the FSC 0.5 criterion 
(Supplementary Figure S3), and these values were used to 
low-pass filter the final volumes. The visualization of den-
sity maps and atomic structures was performed using <rs type="software">UCSF 
Chimera</rs> (21). The dockings were firstly performed manu-
ally and then rendered by <rs type="software">Chimera</rs>, using a real time cor-
relation criterion between the reference model (final model) 
and the surface created from the atomic structure/model. 
The final validation of the obtained models was performed 
by comparison of the final 3D map projections and the gen-
erated class averages (<rs type="software">EMAN</rs>) with the results of 2D classi-
fications (Supplementary Figure S2B). </p>

<p>density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping 
arrays (HumanCoreExome-12 v1-0; Illumina, San Diego, CA) 
were used to detect the presence of CNVs from genomic DNA. 
Arrays were processed according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. To minimize false-positives, CNVs were called

<p>When done correctly, the survival rates in mice (male: age 8-10 weeks, 22-28g; female: age 10-12 weeks, 20-26g) are: over 90% in acute 
ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning experiments, over 85% in permanent artery ligation studies, and approximately 80% for 
intramyocardial injections. Since early injury is more readily visible by metabolic changes rather than structural, infarct size determination in 
ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning experiments is performed by infusing 1% Evan's blue dye into the aorta which will perfuse the 
heart that is not supplied by the LAD (Figure 1A). Once the heart is removed and transversely cut in half, the tissue is incubated in 1% solution 
of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to measure infarct size (Figure 1B). The areas are measured using <rs type="software">Scion</rs> or <rs type="software">NIH imaging</rs> software which 
can be calibrated using a micrometer imaged at the same magnification. These numbers are used to calculate area at risk/left ventricle and 
infarct size/area at risk </p>

<p>Permanent artery ligation results in gross structural changes such as necrosis, wall thinning, and chamber dilation. Comparison of the effects of 
treatment and/or time on infarct size and necrosis relative to the left ventricle, chamber area, septal wall and left ventricular free wall thickness in 
the permanent occlusion model (Figure 2A) can also be measured using <rs type="software">Scion</rs> or <rs type="software">NIH imaging</rs> software. Collagen staining with picrosirius red/ 
fast green (Figure 2B) can be used to measure insterstitial fibrosis which correlates to functional indices of wall stiffening </p>

<p>Nucleosomes were assembled on 54A18 DNA fragments 
for RSC and SWI/SNF repositioning and 54A0 DNA 
fragments for Chd1 repositioning. Each 10 ml reaction 
contained 1 pmol of wild-type and mutant nucleosomes 
assembled on cy3 and cy5 labelled DNA, respectively, 
50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM 
ATP and the quantity of remodeller specified in figures. 
Samples were incubated in 0.2-ml thin walled PCR tubes 
(ABgene, UK) in an Eppendorf mastercycle with heated 
lid at 308C for the times specified in figures, before reac-
tion termination by transferal to ice and addition of 500 ng 
of HindIII-digested bacteriophage lambda competitor 
DNA (Promega, USA) and 5% (w/v) sucrose. Samples 
were resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel [5% acryla-
mide:bis acrylamide (49:1 ratio), 0.2 Â TBE buffer 
(0.5 mM EDTA, 22.3 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3), 0.1% 
APS and 0.1% TEMED]. Gels were cast horizontally 
between 20 by 20-cm glass plates using 1.5-mm Teflon 
spacers, before mounting vertically in the gel apparatus 
(Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) and pre-running at 
300 V for 3 h with continuous pump recirculation of 0.2 
Â TBE buffer between the upper and lower compartments 
at 48C. Gels were run at 300 V for 3.5 h and imaged using 
a Phosphoimager FLA-5100 (Fujifilm, Japan). Gel band 
intensities were quantitated using <rs id="software-0" type="software">AIDA</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Raytest</rs>, Germany). The proportion of nucleosomes repo-
sitioned was calculated as the intensity of the sum of all 
detectable products over the sum of the major initial posi-
tion plus products. In many assembly reactions a propor-
tion of nucleosomes are assembled at a minor assembly 
location marked as the P position (e.g. 
Ã in Figure 2A) (18). 
Including this band in the calculations was found not to 
significantly affect the determination of initial rates. 
In some histone mutants the proportion of nucleosomes 
assembled at the P position was altered, and some 
additional less abundant sites of deposition were also 
observed. However, again inclusion nucleosomes 
assembled at these locations was not found to significantly 
affect the comparison of initial rates. As a result, in the 
analysis presented here nucleosomes deposited at locations 
other than the major NucA locations are not in included 
in quantitation. For some mutations a small proportion of 
nucleosomes were observed to undergo thermal reposi-
tioning in control reactions lacking remodelling enzyme. 
However, this was generally detected after long incuba-
tions and the proportion of nucleosomes repositioned at 
early time points was low enough not to affect the calcu-
lation of initial rates. The reproducibility of the assay 
when carried out in this manner was found to be high 
(Supplementry Figure 1). 
In this way the proportion of nucleosomes repositioned 
is calculated independently of the total signal detectable in 
each lane. The initial rate was calculated as previously 
described (11). Each initial rate was repeated at least </p>

<p>egories: underweight (&lt;18.5 kg/m²), normal (18.5-24.9 kg/ 
m²), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m²), obese (30.0-34.9 kg/m²), 
and extremely obese (≥35.0 kg/m²) [7]. Weight gain during 
pregnancy was also categorized into three groups based on 
the 2009 revision of IOM gestational weight gain guidelines 
(adequate, excessive, and inadequate weight gain) [8]. Infants 
who were small for their gestational age (SGA) or large for 
their gestational age (LGA) were defined as those that were in 
the &lt;10% and &gt;90%, respectively, of the 1999 Korean birth 
weight percentiles [9]. Data regarding other variables (e.g., 
maternal age, gestational age at delivery, parity, birth weight, 
and neonatal information) were obtained from the subjects' 
medical records. 
The primary outcome for this study was the rate of emer-
gency cesarean section, which we compared across the 
prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain categories. 
The secondary outcome was the risk of emergency cesar-
ean section among the prepregnancy BMI and gestational 
weight gain categories. For an inter-group comparison of 
age, prepregnancy weight and BMI, gestational weight gain, 
gestational age at delivery and neonate birth weight, we used 
an independent t-test. For a comparison of parity, GDM, the 
incidence of LGA infants, each BMI status and each gesta-
tional weight gain status based on the 2009 IOM guidelines, 
a chi-square test was used. To evaluate the crude association 
between prepregnancy BMI or gestational weight gain and 
emergency cesarean section, logistic regression analysis was 
used to calculate the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). We also calculated the adjusted 
ORs after adjusting for potential confounding factors, includ-
ing maternal age, parity, gestational age at delivery, birth 
weight, labor induction, LGA, fetal sex, and GDM. Additional 
regression models included prepregnancy BMI and gestational 
weight gain with the other confounders to evaluate the inde-
pendent effect of prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight 
gain on the risk of emergency cesarean section. To further 
investigate the difference gestational weight gain-emergency 
cesarean section association stratified by maternal prepreg-

<p>mat on the Open Medicine wiki, the review underwent 
a second round of peer review by the editorial board of 
Open Medicine. 
The Open Medicine wiki utilized the open-source 
platform developed by <rs type="software">Mediawiki</rs> (the same software 
application used by Wikipedia) to create a viewing and 
navigating experience that would likely be familiar to 
users of the site (Fig. 1). The wiki was hosted and admin-
istered by the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation, a 
joint research initiative of the University of Toronto and 
the University Health Network in Toronto. It was brand-
ed with the Open Medicine logo and linked to the Open 
Medicine website.

50% reduction in a leg-wound infection according to the CDC 
definition ( primary endpoint) in one of the groups. Data were 
analysed according to the 'as treated' principle ( predefined). 
The groups were compared with unpaired t-test (continuous 
normally distributed data), Mann-Whitney test (continuous data 
not normally distributed) or χ 
2 test (categorical variables). The 
effect of type of suture on SSI was evaluated with the χ 
2 test and 
reported with risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The temporal distribution of the primary endpoint was com-
pared with the log-rank test, including 5 patients who were lost

<p>motif recognition as compared to ordinary HMMs. 
Profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been one of the most 
successful methods to date for recognizing both close and distant 
homologs of given protein sequences. Popular HMM methods such 
as <rs id="software-0" type="software">HMMER</rs> (Eddy et al., <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">1998</rs>a, b) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">SAM</rs> (Hughey and Krogh, 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">1996</rs>) have been behind the design of databases such as Pfam (Finn 
et al., 2006), PROSITE (Hulo et al., 2006) and SUPERFAMIILY 
(Wilson et al., 2007). However, a limitation of these HMMs is, since 
there is only finite state information about the sequence that can be 
held in any particular position, HMMs cannot capture dependencies 
that are far, and variable distance apart, in sequence. 
On the other hand, in β-structural motifs, as was noticed by 
Lifson, Sander and others (Hubbard and Park, 1995; Lifson and 
Sander, 1980; Olmea et al., 1999; Steward and Thornton, 2002; Zhu 
and Braun, 1995), amino acid residues that are hydrogen bonded 
in β-sheets exhibit strong pairwise statistical dependencies. These 
residues, however, can be far away and a variable distance apart in 
sequence, making them impossible to capture in an HMM. Early 
work of Bradley et al. (Bradley et al., 2001; Cowen et al., 2002) 
show that these pairwise correlations help to recognize protein 
sequences that fold into the right-handed parallel β-helix fold. More 
recent work has used a conditional random field or Markov random 
field framework, both of which generalize HMMs beyond linear 
dependencies, to identify the right-handed parallel β-helix fold (Liu 
et al., 2009), the leucine rich repeat fold (Liu et al., 2009) and the 
β-propeller folds (Menke et al., 2010). </p>

<p>While these conditional random field and Markov random field 
models are extremely powerful in theory, in practice, substantial 
computational barriers remain for template construction, training 
and computing the minimum energy threading of an unknown 
sequence onto a template. Thus, a general structure software tool 
designed for β-structural folds, in the same manner as <rs type="software">HMMER</rs> 
and SAM packages recognize all protein structural folds, remains a 
challenging unsolved problem. 
In this article, we find an unusual and different way to 
incorporate pairwise dependencies into profile HMM. In particular, 
we generalize our recent work (Kumar and Cowen, 2009) on 
augmenting HMM training data to include these very pairwise 
dependencies as a part of a larger training set (see below). While 
this method of incorporating pairwise dependencies is undoubtedly 
less powerful than MRF methods, it has the advantage of being 
simple to implement, computationally fast and allows the modular 
application of existing HMM software packages. We show that our 
augmented HMMs perform better than ordinary HMMs on the task 
of recognizing β-structural SCOP (Lo Conto et al., 2002) protein 
superfamilies. In particular, we consider the problem of how well 
an HMM trained on only one family β-structural SCOP superfamily 
can learn to recognize members of other SCOP families in that 
SCOP superfamily, as compared to decoys. We show a median AUC 
improvement of nearly 5% for our approach compared to ordinary 
HMMs on this task. </p>

<p>Our approach is based on the simulated evolution paradigm 
introduced in Kumar and Cowen (2009). The possibility that motif 
recognition methods could be improved with the addition of artificial 
training sequences had been previously suggested in the protein 
design community (Koehl and Levitt, 1999), though the methods of 
Koehl and Levitt (1999); Larson et al. (2003) and Am Busch et al. 
(2009) to generate these sequences are much more computationally 
intensive than the simple sequence-based mutation model of Kumar 
and Cowen. In particular, Kumar and Cowen created new training 
sequences by artificially adding point mutations to the original 
sequences in the training set, using the BLOSUM62 matrix (Eddy, 
2004). The HMM training was then used on this larger, augmented 
training set unchanged. 
In this article, we compare ordinary <rs type="software">HMMER</rs> Profile HMMs, 
<rs type="software">HMMER</rs> Profile HMMs augmented with a point mutation model 
(similar to Kumar and Cowen, 2009), and HMMs augmented 
with training sequences based on pairwise dependencies of β-sheet 
hydrogen bonding (see Fig. 1). Thus we have generalized the 
single frequency approach of Kumar and Cowen (2009), to pairwise 
probabilities. More specifically, to create our new training sequence </p>

<p>3.2.1 Aligning sequences with <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> For the single frequency 
augmented training model, we used the popular program <rs id="software-8" type="software">MUSCLE</rs> <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">Version 4</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Edgar</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-date">2004</rs>) to generate the MSA that was provided to the HMM training 
methods. It is one of the fastest programs available and produces global 
sequence alignments for the set of sequences from a family. We developed a 
script to transform the <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> alignment output to .ssi (STOCKHOLM) 
format since other <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> output formats are not supported by <rs id="software-11" type="software">HMMER</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-11" type="version-number">3.0a2</rs>. </p>

<p>3.2.2 Aligning sequences with Matt For the pairwise augmented training 
model, and the hybrid model, we used multiple alignment with translations 
and twists (<rs id="software-12" type="software">Matt</rs>) (Menke et al., <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-date">2008</rs>) to align the sequences based on 
the structure. By allowing local flexibility and allowing small translations 
and rotations, Matt demonstrates an ability to better align the ends of α-
helices and β-strands. We used Matt in default configuration for aligning the 
sequences in a family. Alignment based on structure is essential to determine 
the location of β-strands in the sequences and thus augment the dataset based 
on conserved residue pairs in β-strands. </p>

<p>3.3.2 β-Strand mutation model In this step we augment the MSA with a 
set of sequences that are produced by mutating the original sequences in such 
a way that the frequency of pairs of amino acids hydrogen bonded in β-sheets 
resembles the frequency observed in known protein fold space. We use the 
pairwise conditional probability frequency tables from the recent paper of 
Menke et al. (2010). There are two tables, representing the in-out residue 
positions, respectively, for β-sheets that have one side buried and one side 
exposed to solvent. The tables were learned from solved protein structures 
in the PDB. 
β−Strands in the aligned set of structures are found by the program 
SmurfPreparse which is part of the Smurf Package (<rs corresp="#software-13" type="creator">Menke</rs>, 2009; Menke 
et al., 2010). The program not only outputs the positions of the consensus 
β-strands in the alignment, it also declares a position buried or exposed based 
on which of the two tables is the best fit to the amino acids that appear in 
that position in the training data. 
For each sequence in the training set, M mutated sequences with p% 
mutations are created and added to the training set. Here 'p' is set not to be 
proportional to the total length of the entire sequence, but instead to the total 
length of the β-strand positions in the alignment. New sequences are created 
as follows. Residue positions contained in β-strands are selected uniformly 
at random. If position 'i' is selected, its pair residue 'j' is found (note that 
j may appear before or after 'i' in sequence) and i is mutated according to 
the appropriate pairwise table, conditioned on it being hydrogen bonded to 
the residue of type in position 'j'. This process is repeated p times and the 
resulting sequence is added to the augmented training set. At the end of this 
process, for example, a family with 100 original sequences in the training 
set will have 100 + M × 100 (100 original + M × 100 mutated) sequences in 
the augmented training set. In this study, we set values of p that would result 
in training sets with 10-100% mutations (note: we allow sites to mutate 
more than once, for example some of the positions even a sequence with a 
100% mutation rate may not end up mutated) and tested multiple values of 
M ranging from 10-1000. We picked a value of M at which the results were 
stable at the 20% mutation rate (see Section 3.5). </p>

<p>In our approach, the primary steps in building the HMM remain the same 
except the training set is augmented with mutated sequences based on the 
two evolutionary models. The process is shown in Figure 1. 
Two packages are widely adopted to work width profile HMMs: <rs id="software-15" type="software">SAM</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-15" type="creator">Hughey and Krogh</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-15" type="version-date">1996</rs>) and <rs id="software-16" type="software">HMMER</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-16" type="creator">Eddy</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-16" type="version-date">1998</rs>a, b). <rs type="software">SAM</rs> has been 
demonstrated to be more sensitive overall, while HMMER's model scoring 
is more accurate (Wistrand and Sonnhammer, 2004). In this study we use 
<rs id="software-18" type="software">HMMER</rs> <rs corresp="#software-18" type="version-number">versions 3.0a2</rs> to evaluate the models of protein families as it is 
freely available and can be easily downloaded from the website. We construct 
HMMs from the MSAs using the <rs type="software">hmmbuild</rs> program which is part of the 
<rs type="software">HMMER</rs> package. 
In this approach, the model of the HMM is made up of a linear set of 
match (M) states, one per consensus column in the MSA. Each M state emits 
a single residue, with a probability score that is determined by the frequency 
that residues have been observed in the corresponding column of the MSA. 
Each match state therefore carries a vector of 20 probabilities, for scoring the 
20 amino acids. The HMMs also model the gapped alignments by including 
insertion (I) and deletion (D) states in between the match states. The match, 
insertion and deletion states are connected by the transition probabilities. 
In our experiment, <rs type="software">HMMER</rs> is used as a black box except the constraints 
on choosing match states are made tighter. Using default settings, <rs type="software">HMMER</rs> 
creates a match state whenever a column in the MSA has &lt;50% gaps. We 
found empirically in Kumar and Cowen (2009) that the default cutoff was 
not optimal for our datasets because homology was too remote, and creating 
a column whenever there are &lt;20% gaps yielded the best HMMs on our 
datasets. Thus we duplicate this threshold in the current study. 
By default, <rs type="software">HMMER</rs> uses a maximum a posteriori (MAP) architecture 
algorithm to find the model architecture with the highest posterior probability 
for the alignment data. The algorithm is guaranteed to find a model and </p>

<p>constructs the model by assuming that the MSA is correct and then marks 
columns that correspond to match states. An HMM is created for every MSA, 
thus there is a one to one correspondence between an MSA and an HMM, 
generating a library of HMMs. Therefore, for any sequence from the MSA, 
the HMM can be used to determine if it belongs to the MSA. In addition, the 
HMM can be used to check if a new sequence is similar to the sequences in 
the MSA and if it is then one can place the new protein in the same family. 
We used the default 'glocal' setting to construct the models which are global 
with respect to model and find multiple hit local with respect to sequence. 
In order to reduce the skewness in the distribution of sequences used 
to construct an HMM, <rs type="software">HMMER</rs> supports several options to weight the 
sequences in training data. The default option GSC assigns lower weights 
to sequences that are over-represented (Gerstein et al., 1994). In addition, 
<rs type="software">HMMER</rs> supports external and internal sequence weighting strategies based 
on information theoretic principles. Based on our study of different sequence 
weighting options for HMMs with and without the point mutation augmented 
training for the task of learning SCOP superfamilies (Kumar and Cowen, 
2009) we used <rs type="software">SAM</rs> sequence entropy (Karplus et al., 1998) throughout the 
present study. </p>

<p>P(seq|HMM) is the probability of the target sequence according to a 
HMM and P(seq|null) is the probability of the target sequence given a 'null 
hypothesis' model of the statistics of random sequence. In HMMER, this 
null model is a simple one-state HMM that says that random sequences are 
independently and identically distributed sequences with a specific residue 
composition. In addition, <rs type="software">HMMER</rs> also generates an E-value which is the 
expected number of false positives with a score as high as the hit sequence. 
While the log odd scores (S) provides information on the quality of a hit, 
the E-value gives a measure relative to other sequences. Therefore a lower 
E-value implies that the sequence matches more closely to the HMM. 
After constructing an HMM, a cutoff for the score (S), or E-value, is set. 
A new sequence that lies within the cutoff is said to belong to the family that 
is associated with the HMM. Thus by varying the cutoff, the true positive 
and false positive rates of the classifier can be tuned. We run experiments 
over a range of cutoffs to generate receiver operating characteristics (ROC) 
plots that graph the tradeoffs of the true and false positives, as the cutoffs are 
tuned. We also compute the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to summarize 
the classifier statistic in a single number (Sonego et al., 2008). 
We also use average errors at minimum error point (MEP) statistics to 
assess the performance of HMMs. An MEP is the score threshold at which 
the classifier makes fewest errors of both kinds, i.e. false positives and false 
negatives (Karchin et al, 2002). The percentage of both types of errors 
provides a comparison of both sensitivity and specificity. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses

correct for differences in the sex distribution between our 
sample and it's population distribution. Risk ratios and

<p>bjective: This study evaluated experimentally-induced periapical bone loss sites using 
digital radiographic and histopathologic parameters. Material and Methods: Twenty-
seven Wistar rats were submitted to coronal opening of their mandibular right first molars. 
They were radiographed at 2, 15 and 30 days after the operative procedure by two digital 
radiographic storage phosphor plates (Digora 
® ). The images were analyzed by creating 
a region of interest at the periapical region of each tooth (<rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>) and registering the 
corresponding pixel values. After the sacrifice, the specimens were submitted to microscopic 
analysis in order to confirm the pulpal and periapical status of the tooth. Results: There was 
significant statistically difference between the control and test sides in all the experimental 
periods regarding the pixel values (two-way ANOVA; p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The microscopic 
analysis proved that a periapical disease development occurred during the experimental 
periods with an evolution from pulpal necrosis to periapical bone resorption. </p>

<p>. 
The radiographic evaluation was performed 
using the public domain software <rs id="software-1" type="software">Image J</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 1.33 µ</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">National Institute of Health</rs>, Washington, 
DC) A region of interest (ROI/252 pixels) was 
opened in the periapical region of the every tooth, 
closest to the mesial root, without touching it. 
Only the periapical bone was enclosed in the ROI. 
Using the histogram tool, the pixel values of the 
ROIs were established. The normalized pixel values 
of the images (NPI) were then obtained by using 
the following equation </p>

<p>and periapical tissues were histomorphometrically 
analyzed for both test and control sites. In the test 
site it was noted whether the tooth had pulpitis, 
necrosis or presented any sign of inflammation, 
and whether or not there was presence of periapical 
bone resorption. The percentages of bone tissue in 
the apical region of the root, soft tissue (connective 
tissue and inflammatory infiltrate, when present), 
bone marrow and inferior alveolar nerve were 
obtained in a digital image analysis system, 
composed of a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope, CCD-
IRIS RGB -Sony camera (Sony DXC-151A RGB 
Video Camera-Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) 
and <rs id="software-2" type="software">Kontron KS300</rs> 
® software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Kontron Electronic GMBM</rs>, Munich, Germany). For this purpose, an 
image was captured at 10x objective from each 
histologic slice, which contained the apical portion 
of the mesial root perpendicular to the alveolar 
nerve, positioned centrally. The studied area was 
established in numbers of pixels. each image 
captured had 307,200 pixels and evaluated total 
area was 1536,000 pixels. The area (in pixels) was 
measured to quantify the area occupied by bone 
tissue in the apical region of the root, soft tissue 
(connective tissue and inflammatory infiltrate, when 
present), bone marrow and inferior alveolar nerve. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis 
Statistical analyses were performed with the software package <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">19.0 J</rs> for Windows 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., IL, USA). Categorical variables were assessed with the Pearson chi-square test, 
and quantitative variables were compared with unpaired 2-tailed t tests. A P value ≤0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. Values are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. </p>

<p>day an ontology file was downloaded from http://archive.geneontology.org/ 
latest-termdb/go_daily-termdb.obo-xml.gz. The definition file was also 
downloaded from the GO website and it was used to construct a DAG 
in the biological process subspace. We have developed a Python library 
with a set of application programming interfaces for building different GO-
related graphs and performing various queries (Muller et al., 2009). This 
library is based on the Python package <rs type="software">NetworkX</rs> (Hagberg et al., 2008). 
In a graph representation of the GO, referred to as GOGraph, each node 
(vertex) represents a GO term and each directed edge corresponds to the 
IS_A relationship between a parent-child GO term pair. The directed edges 
between terms represent their semantic relationship such that the concept of 
a parent node subsumes those of its children nodes. Hence, the constructed 
GOGraph obeys the 'true path rule' or in other words the pathway from a 
child term to the most top-level parent is always true. Then, genes are added 
as another type of node to the GOGraph via an edge to its associated GO 
term(s) to create the GOGeneGraph. The GOGeneGraph is further modified 
by the addition of edges between terms that share the same gene annotations. 
Associating GO terms with the genes they annotate enables the calculation of 
semantic distance for edges from a GOGraph using the established methods, 
see Section 2.2 for details. After initialization of the edge distances, the 
graph is further transformed into a weighted, undirected graph, so that the 
functional coherence of list of GO terms can be reflected by connectivity 
and distances among the terms rather than the directionality. The algorithm 
for constructing a GOGeneGraph is detailed in Supplementary Algorithm 1. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 11.5</rs>,

HBsAg concentrations were logarithmically transformed 
for analysis. Continuous variables were expressed as 
mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (range), and 
categorical variables as absolute and relative frequencies. 
Characteristics were compared between groups using Mann-
Whitney or two-sample Student's t-tests for analysis of 
continuous variables, and Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests 
for analysis of categorical variables and Mann-Whitney

<p>MRI data analysis and definitions 
All MRI data was obtained on the cine images using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">MASS</rs> 
software package (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Medis</rs>, Leiden, The Netherlands). On all the 
short-axis cine slices, the endocardial and epicardial borders 
were outlined manually on the end-diastolic and -systolic im-
ages. We divided the short axis into 12 equiangular segments to 
measure the LV segmental function, and the LV volumes and LV 
ejection fractions (LVEF) were calculated. We assessed delayed 
enhancement images and infarct size as previously described 
(14). The total infarct size was calculated as the percentage of 
the LV mass, and transmural extent of infarction was calculated 
by dividing the hyper-enhanced area by the total area of the pre-
defined segment (%). A transmurality score was calculated in 
each patient, which was expressed as the sum of segments with 
&gt; 75% infarcted myocardium as a percentage of the total num-
ber of segments scored. On the delayed enhancement images, 
the MO was defined as any region of hypo-enhancement with-
in the hyper-enhanced infarcted area, and was included in the 
calculation of the total infarct size. The extent of MO was calcu-
lated in each patient, and measured percent by dividing num-
ber of MO segment by number of total segment. All MRI mea-
surements of the LVEF and extent of MO and infarct size were 
reviewed by two independent blinded observers. The intra-class 
correlation coefficients for the intra-and inter-observer agree-
ment for these parameters were all &gt; 0.9. </p>

<p>mined by cardiac MRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
was used to assess the relationship between coronary hemody-
namic pressure parameters and the presence of MO. A P value

<p>administration of propofol. Then, propofol 2 mg/kg was infused. 
Ninety seconds after the completion of propofol injection and 
confirmation of loss of consciousness, rocuronium (0.8 mg/kg) 
and remifentanil were administered simultaneously with 3% 
desflurane inhalation. Intubation was attempted 150 sec after 
the commencement of remifentanil administration. 
Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at pre-induction, 
after the propofol injection, immediately before and after intu-
bation, and at 1 and 2 minutes after intubation. Any incidences 
of hypotension were recorded. Hypotension was defined as SBP 
that did not exceed 80 mmHg, or mean arterial blood pressure 
equal to or less than 55 mmHg. Hypotension was treated with 
an intravenous bolus of ephedrine 5 mg unless immediate 
intubation was anticipated. Any incidences of hypertension 
were also recorded, and this was defined as SBP higher than 
120% of the pre-induction baseline values. 
Data are presented as mean ± SD or number of patients. In 
the Cochran-Armitage test for trend in proportions, a sample 
size of 19 patients per group was required from the five groups 
with remifentanil dose corresponding to EC of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 
4 ng/ml, and the proportion of successful intubation without 
development of hypertension was equal to 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 
and 0.90 respectively. A total sample size of 95 patients was 
required to achieve an 86% power to detect a linear trend using 
a two-sided Z test with continuity correction and a significance 
level of 0.05 (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 8.0.05</rs>, <rs id="software-1" type="software">PASS</rs> </p>

to be passed when P value was ≥ 0.05. Patient characteristics 
between the five groups were compared using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA). A probit analysis was used to calculate 
the EC of remifentanil required to achieve intubation without 
developing hypertension in 95% of patients. Repeated measures 
of the haemodynamic value were analyzed using repeated 
measured analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment for 
multiple comparisons when appropriate. </p>

<p>Visual stimulation, data acquisition and analysis 
IOS recordings were performed under avertin anesthesia (20 ll/ 
g, i.p.) at P25-26, P27-28 and P31-32. Images were visualized us-
ing an Olympus microscope (BX50WI). Red light illumination 
was provided by 8 red LEDs (625 nm, Knight Lites KSB1385-1P) 
attached to the objective (Zeiss Plan-NEOFLUAR 5x, NA: 0.16) us-
ing a custom made metal LED holder (33). The animal was se-
cured under the objective using a ring-shaped neodynium 
magnet (www.supermagnete.it; date last accessed April 1, 2017, 
R-12-09-1.5-N) mounted on an arduino-based 3D printed imag-
ing chamber that also controls eye shutters and a thermostated 
heating pad (Fig. 1B; http://labrigger.com/blog/2015/11/30/open-

Visual stimuli were generated using <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> Psychtoolbox and 
presented on a gamma corrected 9.7 in. monitor, placed 10 cm 
away from the eyes of the mouse. Square wave gratings were 
presented in the binocular portion of the visual field (À10 </p>

<p>SVM classifier 
Z-scored values of each physiological parameter were used for 
linear SVM classification. SVM is a supervised machine learning 
method for data classification that can be trained to find the 
best hyperplane that separates all data points in two user-
defined classes and can subsequently be exploited to blind-
predict the class to which a new observation belongs (37-39). 
We defined two classes: mutated (heterozygous and null) and 
wild-type (males and females) mice. By using the <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> func-
tion svmtrain, we trained the SVM with a subset of data consist-
ing of 50% of the dataset and we than used the remaining 50% 
for testing, using the svmclassify function. Accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity and D-prime (d 
0 ) were then computed for the categor-</p>

<p>and specificity were defined as (TP þ TN)/total, TP/P and TN/N, 
respectively, where TP: True positive, TN: True Negative, P: total 
positives, N: total negatives. D-prime, which measures the dis-
tance between the signal and the noise means in standard 
deviation units (40), was calculated using <rs type="software">matlab</rs> function 
dprime_simple 
(https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileex

Differences between groups were tested for significance using 
two-way ANOVA, unless otherwise indicated. Holm-Sidak's 
multiple comparisons post hoc tests were performed, where ap-
propriate, to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. In the fig-

<p>part of the FSL (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v5.0.6</rs>; University of Oxford, Oxford UK) software 
package. Initial preprocessing involved corrections for head 
movement and eddy currents, brain tissue extraction, and fitting of 
the diffusion tensor model. These were carried out using the <rs type="software">FSL</rs> 
<rs type="software">eddy_correct</rs>, <rs type="software">bet</rs>, and <rs type="software">dtifit</rs> tools, respectively. The standard TBSS 
analysis workflow was followed (V 1.2; http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ 
fsl/fslwiki/TBSS/UserGuide), with the following specific options: 
nonlinear registration to the FMRIB58_FA standard-space image; </p>

<p>generation of a study-specific mean FA image for skeletonization; 
and a 0.2 threshold for the mean FA skeleton. 
The voxel-wise statistical analysis was carried out using the <rs type="software">FSL</rs> 
<rs type="software">randomize</rs> tool. A two-group unpaired t-test design was used for 
comparing admission scans of control and mTBI subjects. A paired 
t-test design was used for comparing admission and follow-up 
scans of mTBI subjects. These statistical analyses were carried out 
separately for FA, MD, and RD values. In all cases, cluster-based 
thresholding was used, and 0.05 was adopted as the threshold for 
significant clusters. </p>

<p>Region of interest. In addition, we obtained mean FA, MD, 
and RD for all tracts identified on TBSS using region of interest 
(ROI) analysis. The image-processing pipeline consisted of pre-
processing, image registration, and analysis, utilizing the FSL

<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">National Institute of Mental Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD) software 
packages. Initial preprocessing involved corrections for head 
movement and eddy currents, brain tissue extraction, and fitting of 
the diffusion tensor model. These were carried out using the <rs type="software">FSL</rs> 
<rs type="software">eddy_correct</rs>, <rs type="software">bet</rs>, and <rs type="software">dtifit</rs> tools, respectively. For image regis-
tration, the FSL tool <rs type="software">fnirt</rs> was used to carry out nonlinear spatial 
registration of each subject to the FMRIB58_FA standard-space 
image, using the built-in FA_2_FMRIB58_1mm config file. This 
was assumed to be spatially compatible with the International 
Consortium of Brain Mapping (ICBM) DTI-81 atlas. Post-
registration, composite axial slice images of the underlying FA and </p>

<p>
ICBM atlas tract outlines were generated at z = 42 and z = 82 for 
each subject. An experienced neuroradiologist (N.R.) verified the 
overall registration quality of these images. Finally, the <rs type="software">AFNI 
3dROIstats</rs> tool was used to map the predefined ROIs to each in-
dividual subject and calculate the median FA, MD, and RD values 
for each tract. </p>

<p>In addition to the compliance, for each medication we 
calculated the proportion that was actually taken according 
to the dosage and duration prescribed. We also counted the 
number of mothers who had one or more prescriptions for 
each medication group and subgroup. We used <rs id="software-0" type="software">PASW

<p>For the first set of expression analysis, patient bone marrow 
samples were hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-
U133B chips as described previously. 
25 The HG-U133A, HG-
U133B and HG-U133plus2 CEL files were first normalized 
separately using robust multi-array normalization and then 
combined into one matrix and normalized altogether using an 
empirical Bayes method as described previously.

<p>Live-cell microscopy and micropatterns 
For live-cell imaging of cell populations, 18000 cells were 
seeded in 96-well imaging plates (BD Falcon) 16 h before imag-
ing on either a DeltaVision Spectris imaging system (Applied 
Precision) using a 20£, NA 0.7 objective, or on a ImageXpress 
system (Molecular Devices) using a 20£, NA 0.45 objective. 
For experiments involving micropatterns, cells were detached 
using PBS containing 0.2% EDTA and seeded on fibronectin-
coated micropatterns (CYTOO) at a density of 60000 cells/ml 
5 h before starting the experiment. After 30 min cover slips were 
washed with PBS to remove unattached cells. 
Images were processed and analyzed using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. For time-
lapse microscopy quantification of populations the background 
was subtracted for every image series using rolling ball back-
ground subtraction. Furthermore, the image series were manually 
screened and series with fluorescent aggregates were excluded 
from the analysis. Subsequently, integrated fluorescent intensities 
were calculated and values were normalized for each series on the 
time point before inhibitor addition. Mean values of at least 8 
individual positions per condition were calculated. </p>

<p>ously (23). HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were 
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, 
VA). JFCR39 and MDA-MB-435/GFP-CLCa cells were cul-
tured in RPMI 1640 medium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) 
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ 
ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) in a humidified atmosphere 
including 5% CO 2 at 37°C. HEK293T was cultured in DMEM 
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries) supplemented with 10% 
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and kanamycin, at 37°C 
under 5% CO 2 . For in vivo studies, BSY-1 cells were grown as 
subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. 
Analysis of Cell Growth Inhibition-The inhibition of cell 
proliferation was assessed by measuring changes in total cellu-
lar protein in a culture of each of the JFCR39 cell lines after 48 h 
of drug treatment by use of a sulforhodamine B assay (24). The 
50% growth inhibition (GI 50 ) value was calculated as described 
previously (18, 19). 
COMPARE Analysis-Based on these sets of GI 50 values, fin-
gerprints are presented in the graphic profiles of relative sensi-
tivity within JFCR39. To analyze the correlation between the 
fingerprints of drug A and drug B, we exploited the COMPARE 
computer algorithm as described previously (18, 20, 22). The 
Pearson correlation coefficient between the fingerprints of 
drug A and drug B was calculated (n ϭ 39). 
Live Imaging-MDA-MB-435/GFP-CLCa cells were grown 
in a 35-mm glass-bottomed dish (Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, 
Japan) for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with chem-
icals and imaged on the temperature-controlled stage top incu-
bator (Tokai Hit Co., Shizuoka, Japan) of fluorescent micros-
copy IX81 (Olympus Corp.) with a ϫ60 oil, NA 1.35 objective at 
37°C under 5% CO 2 . Temperature and CO 2 concentration 
were maintained with an INUG2A control unit (Tokai Hit Co.). 
<rs id="software-9" type="software">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, PA) 
was used to control image acquisition and manipulation. For 
time-lapse observation, images were recorded as described pre-
viously by Sakaushi et al. (23). 
Arf-GTP Pulldown Assay-The pulldown assay to estimate 
the signals of GTP-bound Arfs was performed as described pre-
viously (25, 26). Every pulldown assay was performed with the 
VHS and GAT domains of human GGA3, cloned, and purified 
according to a published protocol (25, 26) with modifications as 
described under supplemental "Experimental Procedures." 
We examined the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of 
endogenous Arfs as follows. BSY-1 cells treated with chemicals 
for 1 h were scraped into 0.5 ml of cold pulldown buffer con-
taining 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 
0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% 
glycerol, and protease inhibitors mixture (Nacalai Tesque Inc., 
Kyoto, Japan). The cell lysate was cleared using GSH-Sepharose 
4B beads. Then the lysate was gently rotated with the beads 
containing 50 g of rGST-GGA3 protein for 30 min at 4°C. 
Bound proteins were washed three times with cold wash buffer 
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1% Non-
idet P-40, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors mixture), fol-
lowed by boiling for 5 min with SDS sample buffer. Proteins in 
the samples were separated in 10 -20% Multi-Gel II mini 
(Cosmo Bio Co., Tokyo, Japan), followed by electroblotting 
onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). </p>

<p>After immunoblotting analysis using anti-pan-Arf and Arf1-
specific antibody, immunoreactive bands were identified with 
the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Health-
care). Band intensity was determined using the program ImageJ 
(National Institute of Health). 
To confirm the inhibitory efficacy of Arf1 activation, 
HEK293T/Arf1-HA cells were used to measure exogenous 
Arf1-GTP. Using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) 
according to the manufacturer's instructions, HEK293T cells 
were transfected with the Arf1-HA expression vector, prepared 
as described under supplemental "Experimental Procedures." 
For transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of 3 ϫ 
10 
6 cells/10 ml in a 10-cm plate. The transfectants were then 
incubated for 24 h, and subsequently treated with chemicals for 
1 h. The cell lysates were assayed as described above. Because of 
a difference in molecular weight, the exogenous band of 
Arf1-HA can be differentiated from the endogenous band 
of intact Arf1. In HEK293T/Arf1-HA cells, the expression of 
intact Arf1 was very low. Therefore, the intensity of the band 
corresponding to Arf1 was apparently weaker than that of the 
exogenous Arf1-HA. 
Conformational Sampling of AMF-26-Conformational 
analysis of AMF-26 was performed on an Apple Power Mac G5 
(PowerPC G5, 2.5 GHz; two central processing units), using the 
Conformational Analyzer with Molecular Dynamics and Sam-
pling (<rs id="software-10" type="software">CAMDAS</rs>) <rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">2.1</rs> program (27). Ten molecular dynamic 
(MD) calculations were simultaneously performed using differ-
ent initial structures. Each of the MD calculations was carried 
out for 1 ns with an integral time step of 1 fs. The lengths of the 
covalent bonds were fixed. The temperature of the system was 
maintained at 1,200 K to enhance the sampling efficiency. Con-
formers were sampled every 100 steps, and then each con-
former was minimized until the root mean square of the gradi-
ents of the potential energy was below 0.001 kcal mol 
Ϫ1 Å </p>

<p>. 
All conformations were clustered with torsion angles of 
heavy atoms using a threshold of Ϯ30°. The Merck Molecu-
lar Force Field 94s was used to evaluate the potential energy 
surface of the molecule (28, 29). The dielectric constant was 
80, but no cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions was 
used. Because of the low probability of the existence of con-
formers with higher energies, the conformers within 15 kcal 
mol 
Ϫ1 of the minimum energy of the molecule were adopted 
for superposition. 
Molecular Modeling of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 Domain 
Complex-To obtain the initial structure of the Arf1-AMF-26-
Sec7 domain complex, the sampled conformers of AMF-26 
were superposed onto BFA in the X-ray structure of the 
Arf-BFA-Sec7 domain complex (PDB code 1r8q) (8) using the 
parallel version of the SUPERPOSE program (30). This super-
poses two molecules based on the physicochemical properties 
of the atomic groups, which is useful for estimating the binding 
conformation of a molecule by distinguishing it from the many 
conformations that are generated by <rs type="software">CAMDAS</rs>. The program 
considers five types of physicochemical property: hydrophobic 
(HP), aromatic (AR), hydrogen-bond donors (HD), hydrogen-
bond acceptors (HA), and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors 
(DA). Each type is represented as a sphere with a predefined 
radius (1.0 or 0.5 Å) and is assigned to a functional group in a </p>

<p>molecule (Fig. 4, A and B). After molecular superposition, the 
matching spheres were scored using the scoring matrix (sup-
plemental Table S1). One AMF-26 conformation was chosen as 
the binding conformation based on the scores and the over-
lapped molecular volumes (Fig. 4C). The superposition calcu-
lations were performed using 28 nodes of a Dell PowerEdge 
1950III (Intel Quad Core Xeon X5460; 3.16 GHz; 56 central 
processing units in total). The overlapped molecular volumes 
were calculated by SYBYL <rs corresp="#software-13" type="version-number">7.3</rs> (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) on an 
Hewlett Packard work station xw8200 (Intel Xeon; 3.60 GHz; 2 
central processing units). 
To relieve the steric hindrances, the coordinates of AMF-26 
and of the residues within 4 Å from AMF-26 were optimized to 
reduce the root mean square of the gradients of potential 
energy below 0.05 kcal mol 
Ϫ1 Å 
Ϫ1 using <rs type="software">SYBYL</rs>. The simplex 
minimization method before the conjugate-gradient minimiza-
tion procedure was used. The Tripos force field was employed 
for the molecular energy calculation. The <rs id="software-15" type="software">AMBER</rs> <rs corresp="#software-15" type="version-number">4.1</rs> charges 
(31) were used as the atomic charges for the proteins and the 
Gasteiger-Hückel charges (32-35) were used as the charges for 
AMF-26. The cut-off distance for the non-bonded interactions 
was 8 Å. The distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4r was 
used. The initial positions of the missing atoms in the crystal 
structure were generated by the <rs type="software">SYBYL</rs>. 
Molecular Dynamics Simulation for Model Refinement-To 
refine the model of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex, 
<rs id="software-17" type="software">AMBER</rs> <rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-number">9</rs> (36) was used for further minimization and MD sim-
ulations on 7 nodes of an Appro 1122Hi (AMD Opteron 248; 
2.20 GHz; 14 central processing units in total). The ff99 (37) 
and gaff (38) force fields were used for the proteins and 
AMF-26, respectively. The partial charges for AMF-26 were 
derived from the restraint electrostatic potential method 
(39) using an ab initio calculation at the HF/6 -31G* level 
using Gaussian 03 (40). The complex was solvated in a box of 
34616 TIP3P (41) water molecules. Six K 
ϩ ions were added 
to neutralize the system. The system was minimized until the 
root mean square of the gradients of potential energy was 
below 0.005 kcal mol 
Ϫ1 Å 
Ϫ1 . The 3.5-ns MD simulation was 
carried out at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature 
(310 K), under periodic boundary conditions, and with par-
ticle-mesh Ewald treatment (42) of electrostatics. SHAKE 
(43) was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen, and a time 
step of 1 fs was used. An 8-Å cutoff was used for the non-
bonded interactions. 
Immunofluorescence Microscopy-After being cultured in a 
24-well glass bottom plate for 48 h, cells were treated with 
chemicals for various periods of time (as indicated in the rele-
vant figure). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with cold 3.8% 
paraformaldehyde in PBS (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 
Osaka, Japan) for 20 min, and then washed and permeabi-
lized with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min at 
room temperature. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer 
containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum (Dako, 
Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min before overnight incubation 
at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. 
After being washed, cells were incubated for 1 h with sec-
ondary antibodies. Cells were then washed, stained with 
DAPI (Molecular Probes), and mounted with fluorescent </p>

<p>mounting medium (Dako). The immunostained cells were 
imaged using a fluorescent microscope IX81 (Olympus 
Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a ϫ100 oil, NA 1.40 objective or 
with a ϫ40, NA 0.95 objective, and <rs id="software-18" type="software">MetaMorph</rs> Software 
(<rs corresp="#software-18" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>, Sunnyvale, CA). 
Transferrin Recycling Assay-Transferrin recycling was 
monitored by modification of a previously published assay 
(44). 6 ϫ 10 
4 cells were incubated in 24-well glass bottom 
plates for 48 h, and then in serum-free medium for 3 h to 
deplete endogenous transferrin. After incubation with 20 
g/ml of Alexa Fluor 488-tagged transferrin (Molecular 
Probes) in PBBS for 1 h, cells were treated with chemicals for 
1 h. Cells were then fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS 
for 20 min at RT, washed with PBS containing 0.1% 1,4-
diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO, Sigma), and mounted with 
fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). 
Flow Cytometry-Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold 
PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were then washed twice 
with ice-cold PBS again, treated with RNase A (500 g/ml; 
Sigma) at 37°C for 1 h, and stained with propidium iodide (25 
g/ml; Sigma). The DNA content of the cells was analyzed with 
a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). 
Animal Experiments-Antitumor effect of AMF-26 was 
tested in vivo against human BSY-1 xenografts in mice. Animal 
care and treatment was performed in accordance with the 
guidelines of the Animal Use and Care Committee of the Japa-
nese Foundation for Cancer Research, and conformed to the 
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female 
nude mice with BALB/c genetic backgrounds were purchased 
from Charles River Japan, Inc. (Yokohama, Japan), maintained 
under specific pathogen-free conditions, and provided with 
sterile food and water ad libitum. Each nude mouse was subcu-
taneously inoculated with the generated tumor fragment of size 
3 ϫ 3 ϫ 3 mm. When the tumors reached a volume of 100 -300 
mm 
3 , animals were randomly divided into control and AMF-26 
groups (each group containing five mice) and daily administra-
tion of AMF-26 was then started (day 0). We examined the toxic 
dose of AMF-26 at a single oral administration. The maximum 
tolerable dose turned out to be 100 mg/kg of body weight. The 
experimental group of mice was orally administered a given 
dose of AMF-26 (83 or 100 mg/kg of body weight) on a daily 
basis from day 0 to 5. The control group of mice was orally 
administered with 0.05% Cremophor EL (Sigma) instead of 
AMF-26. Tumor volume of the tumor-bearing mice was mea-
sured as described previously (22). The length (L) and width 
(W) of the subcutaneous tumor mass of live mice were meas-
ured using calipers. Tumor weight was calculated as tumor 
weight ϭ (L ϫ W 
2 )/2. To assess toxicity, the body weights of the 
tumor-bearing mice were measured. 
Statistical Analysis-Pearson correlation coefficients were 
calculated for the COMPARE analysis and statistical correla-
tion. The two-sided Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess 
the statistical significance of the antitumor efficacy of AMF-26 
in relative tumor growth ratio on days 3, 7, 11, 14, 17, and 21. 
The number of samples is indicated in the description of each 
experiment. All statistical tests were two-sided. </p>

<p>treated cells for 1 h was significantly reduced in a dose-depen-
dent manner compared with the control cells (Fig. 3B). At a 
concentration of 100 M, AMF-26 and BFA reduced the signals 
of exogenous Arf1-GTP to 28.6 and 37.1%, respectively. These 
data suggested that AMF-26 caused Golgi disassembly by 
blocking Arf1 activation. 
Comparison between the BFA and AMF-26 Complexes-To 
support this conclusion, we performed computer model-
ing/MD simulations. The octahydronaphthalene ring of 
AMF-26 (HP1, HP2, and DA1) was superimposed onto the lac-
tone ring of BFA (HP1, HP2, and HA1) by <rs type="software">SUPERPOSE</rs> (Fig. 
4C). During the MD trajectory, the octahydronaphthalene ring 
of AMF-26 resided in the initial position. The refined model of 
the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex was compared with 
the X-ray structure of the Arf1-BFA-Sec7 domain complex 
(Fig. 4, D and E, supplemental Table S2). The same hydropho-
bic residues (Val-53, Thr-64, Trp-66, and Tyr-81 of Arf1 and 
Met-194, Thr-197, and Val-204 of Sec7 domain) interacted 
with the octahydronaphthalene ring of AMF-26 and the lactone 
ring of BFA. The hydrophobic interactions correspond to the 
matching of hydrophobic property spheres (HP1 and HP2) by 
<rs type="software">SUPERPOSE</rs>. The positively charged Arg-19 of Arf1 interacted 
with the hydroxyl oxygen of AMF-26 and the carbonyl oxygen 
of BFA. This electrostatic interaction accounted for the match-</p>

labeled with anti-GBF1 (green) and DAPI (blue). GBF1 was dispersed from the 
perinuclear region, which gave a ribbon-like appearance (white arrowhead), 
into the cytoplasm of AMF-26-or BFA-treated cells. Scale bar, 20 m. D, BSY-1 
cells were treated with AMF-26 (1 M) or BFA (1 M) for 1 h, then washed with 
fresh medium and subsequently cultured without drugs for the indicated 
time. Thereafter, cells were fixed and stained with an antibody against GBF1. 
The images were analyzed by <rs type="software">MetaMorph</rs> software. After the cells were cul-
tured in medium without AMF-26 for 4 h, the normal Golgi structure reap-
peared in the perinuclear area. Symbols represent the following: open circle, 
AMF-26; cross, BFA. Error bar, S.D. </p>

<p>HeLa cells were plated in eight-chamber slides at 10,000 cells/well. 
After serum starvation, cells underwent different treatments as indi-
cated in the figure legends. After fixation with 4% formaldehyde in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, cells were permeabi-
lized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, followed by 1 h of 
blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were stained 
with primary antibodies, rabbit anti-RSK1, rabbit anti-phospho-
T573 RSK, rabbit anti-AKAP95, or mouse anti-HA antibody over-
night at 4°C. Fluorescence staining was performed using Alexa 
488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (green) or 
Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (red). Confocal 
microscopy was performed using a multiphoton Zeiss LSM-510 
laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped 
with a C-Apo 40×/1.2 water lens. Confocal images were acquired 
with <rs type="software">LSM 510</rs> software. Nonconfocal images were acquired with an 
Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) equipped 
with 40×/0.60 lens and Retiga EXi digital camera (QImaging, Surrey, 
Canada). For quantification, the fluorescence densities in the nu-
cleus or cytoplasm were analyzed with <rs id="software-1" type="software">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD). </p>

<p>DNA observations using the cycling nanowire growth devices. The electrophoretic 
DNA mobility measurements in the nanowire array structure were done using T4, 
l, 20 kbp, 10 kbp, 5 kbp, 2 kbp, 1 kbp, 500 bp, and 100 bp DNA molecules 
(Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) stained with the dye, YOYO-1 (Invitrogen), at a dye-to-
base pair ratio of 1515 contained in concentrated buffer solution (5 3 TBE; 
445 mM Tris-Borate and 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.2, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.). An 
inverted fluorescent microscope (Eclipse TE-300, Nikon) equipped with a high 
voltage sequencer (HVS448-1500, Lab Smith) was used to apply the DC electric 
fields and a Hg lamp was used to observe fluorescently stained DNA molecules. 
Fluorescence images were captured with an EB-CCD camera (C7190-43, 
Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) through a 10 3/1.40 NA objective lens (Nikon). The 
images were recorded on a DV tape (DSR-11, Sony) and then analyzed by image-
processing software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">Cosmos</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">32</rs>, Library, Tokyo, Japan). </p>

<p>DNA observations using the agarose gel. l-DNA digested Apa I, stained 
with YOYO-1 at a dye-to-base pair ratio of 1515, was observed in a 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel (650 mm width; 50 mm height), 
which was filled with 5% agarose gel (Pulsed Field Certified Agarose, Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Inc.) in 53 TBE. Under the DC electric field of 300 V/cm, l-DNA 
molecules were observed through a 1003/1.40 NA objective lens on an inverted 
fluorescent microscope (Eclipse TE-300) equipped with a high-voltage sequencer 
(HVS448-1500), 488 nm wavelength laser (FLS-488-20), and EB-CCD camera 
(C7190-43). The images were recorded on a DV tape (DSR-11) and then analyzed 
by image-processing software (<rs id="software-1" type="software">Cosmos</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">32</rs>). </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were made using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">23.0</rs> 
(SPSS). Descriptive statistics are presented as mean ± s.d. In 
comparisons between groups, the independent samples 
t-test was used for continuous variables and the chi-square 
test for categorical variables. Correlations were calculated 
using Pearson correlation (r) for all parameters, except 
for hsCRP where Spearman correlation (r S ) was used 
due the skewed distribution of the parameter. All tests 
were two-tailed, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Linear regression with a stepwise method was 
run with serum DBP as outcome. Covariates were the 
parameters significantly associated with serum DBP in the 
first analyses. The results from the linear regression are 
presented as unstandardized coefficients (В) and standard 
error (s.e.). </p>

<p>Glucose metabolism was assessed by 2 different approaches. 
Firstly, a comprehensive descriptive analysis was aided by the 
area under the curve (AUC) of oGTT of each recipient at 
pretransplant, 3 and 12 months posttransplant. Secondly, an 
improved understanding of the pathophysiology was gained 
by assessing the first phase insulin release (FPIR), insulin resis-
tance and β cell responsiveness. FPIR is an index of the β cell re-
sponse to intravenous glucose (insulinogenic index) and 
was calculated using the IV GTT by FPIR = (AUC insulin 
t0-10 minutes)/(Glucose t0minutes − (Av(t-10 minutes 
and t-1 minutes)) as previously described. 
23 Insulin resis-
tance was determined using paired insulin and glucose re-
sults obtained from IV GTT, which were then applied to 
the homeostatic model assessment 2 (<rs id="software-0" type="software">HOMA2</rs>) calculator, 
available from <rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/download.php</rs>. This has previously been validated in 
ESKD patients. 
24 Insulin sensitivity is the inverse of insulin 
resistance. The DI (IV) was calculated as the FPIR/insulin 
resistance. The DI (IV) is a measure of β cell responsiveness 
and has been shown in the general population to be </p>

<p>14 In this case, we use England in wave 9 as a baseline country-specific time trend as no 
public smoking ban was in place at that time. Treatment effects are computed using differ-
ences between estimated interaction terms, i.e. interactions between country of residence and 
time dummies, before and after the Scottish ban in England and Scotland. More specifically, 
the corresponding treatment effect reported in each table is the one obtained by the following 
double difference: (Scotland*wave 16 -England*wave 16) -(Scotland*wave 15 -Eng-
land*wave 15) where waves 15 and 16 are the pre-and post-Scottish ban waves in the BHPS 
respectively. Standard errors for these treatment effects are obtained using the lincom com-
mand in <rs type="software">Stata</rs>. 
15 The presence of anticipation effects on well-being is explored using placebo tests in 
Table 7. </p>

<p>Molecular identification. Genomic DNA of the strain 
KNU-3 was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's 
instructions. The ITS regions, including the 5.8S, were 
amplified with the primers ITS1 and ITS4 [16]. The 
amplified PCR product (619 bp) was purified using a 
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, 
USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The 
PCR product was sequenced with an ABI Prism 3730 
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 
The sequence was compared with reference ITS1~ITS4 
rDNA sequences in GenBank using <rs id="software-1" type="software">BLAST</rs> analysis (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gob/blast</rs>). The nucleotide sequence 
reported here has been deposited at NCBI-GenBank (accession 
No. KJ921605). The sequences of closely related strains were 
aligned using <rs type="software">MultAlin</rs> program. Phylogenetic analysis was 
carried out by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 
software [17] with the Kimura 2-parameter model. The 
robustness of the tree was evaluated by 1,000 bootstrap 
replications. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. Data were subjected to an analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) and means were compared using 
Tukey's test at p &lt; 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed 
using <rs id="software-4" type="software">SigmaPlot</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Systat Software Inc.</rs>., San Jose, CA, 
USA). </p>

<p>Molecular identification. The ITS sequence of the P. 
menonorum KNU-3 isolate was 100% identical to the 
culture collection NRRL: 50410 of P. menonorum S. W. 
Peterson sp. nov (GenBank accession No. HQ646591). The 
phylogenetic analysis of KNU-3 was carried out by 
distance tree construction. The ITS1 sequence of KNU-3 
was aligned with sequences of available P. menonorum 
strains and its nearest species through the <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> sequence 
using <rs type="software">MultAlin program</rs>, and a neighbor-joining tree was 
constructed from the aligned sequences. The phylogenetic 
analysis revealed that the isolate was grouped with a reference 
isolate of P. menonorum with 99% bootstrap value support 
(Fig. 2), and was distinct from other Penicillium spp., which 
were grouped in distinct clades. These results indicate that 
the isolate KNU-3 is closely related to P. menonorum. 
Based on morphological properties, sequence homology, 
and phylogenetic analysis, the isolate KNU-3 was thus 
identified as P. menonorum. </p>

<p>definitive similarity matches with P. menonorum. In order 
to confirm the morphological results, molecular identification 
of the isolate was carried out based on ITS sequence 
analysis. The ITS sequence of the isolate was compared to 
the GenBank database sequences by using the NCBI-
<rs type="software">BLAST</rs> search program, and it was found to be identical to 
the type strain NRRL: 50410 of P. menonorum S.W. Peterson 
sp. nov. In addition, the phylogenetic tree revealed that the 
isolate was grouped in a distinct clade together with P. 
menonorum with bootstrap support value of 100% (Fig. 2). 
Morphological and molecular characteristics of the isolate 
were in agreement with the description by Peterson et al. 
[15]. P. menonorum S.W. Peterson sp. nov. is a phenotypically 
and genotypically broadly circumscribed new species that 
was first isolated from garden soil in southern California 
by Peterson et al. [15], and P. menonorum isolation from 
Panax ginseng has been reported in China [28]. Nevertheless, 
to our knowledge, this study presents the first record of P. 
menonorum in Korea. 
Many microbial-based agricultural techniques have 
been developed to exploit potential mechanisms for the 
enhancement of crop production in different soils. Although 
members of the genus Penicillium are common opportunistic 
pathogens in the soil environment, some Penicillium strains 
associated with the different plant rhizospheres are able to 
solubilize inorganic insoluble P salts and promote plant 
growth in the soil. Thus, the growth-promoting capacity of 
P. menonorum KNU-3 was evaluated by assaying for IAA 
and siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity, and 
P solubilization. IAA secreted by microorganisms promotes 
root growth through a direct stimulatory effect on plant 
cell elongation or cell division [29]. In the present study, 
P. menonorum KNU-3 was positive for both IAA and 
siderophore production. Other researchers have made 
similar observations for the IAA production by Penicillium 
sp. [11]. Siderophores are important metabolites released 
by the PGP microorganisms that directly alleviate iron </p>

<p>fiber, and with a relatively high glycemic 
index (Table 1). The glycemic load of the 
high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet was 
lower than that of the high-MUFA diet 
(155 vs. 205). The other components of 
the two diets, in particular, the saturated 
fat content, were similar (Table 1). Calo-
ries and nutrients of the diets were calcu-
lated from tables of food composition of 
the Italian Institute of Nutrition using the 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">MetaDieta</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Meteda s.r.l.</rs>., Ascoli-
Piceno, Italy). The main components of 
the two diets were as follows: 1) a portion 
of legumes four times a week, one serving of 
pasta twice a week, and one serving of par-
boiled rice once a week; two servings of 
vegetables and two fruits per day; and 
whole-grain bread for the high-carbohy-
drate/high-fiber diet and 2) white bread, a 
serving of potatoes, rice, or pasta each twice 
weekly; a serving of pizza once a week; and 
use of vegetables and fruits low in fiber for 
the low-carbohydrate diet (a weekly meal 
schedule for both dietary treatments is 
shown in an online appendix, Tables S1 and 
S2, available at http://care.diabetesjournals. 
org/cgi/content/full/dc09-0266/DC1). 
To improve dietary compliance, pa-
tients were seen weekly by an experienced 
dietitian who, in addition, called them ev-
ery 2-3 days to ensure that they followed 
the diet assigned. Adherence to the two 
dietary treatments was evaluated by a 
3-day food record filled in by the patients 
at the end of the two periods. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Data are expressed as means Ϯ SD unless 
otherwise stated. Postprandial incremen-
tal areas were calculated by the trapezoi-
dal method as the area under the curve 
above the baseline value (IAUC). Coeffi-
cients of variations of plasma glucose at 
different points after test meals were eval-
uated as an index of postprandial glyce-
mic variability (14). Differences between 
the two diets were evaluated by ANOVA 
for repeated measures and t test for paired 
data. Two-tailed tests were used, and a 
P Ͻ 0.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. Variables not normally distrib-
uted were analyzed after logarithmic 
transformation or by nonparametric tests. 
Because there was no carry-over ef-
fect, the results of patients starting with 
either diet were put together. The statisti-
cal analysis was performed according to 
standard methods using the Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences software 
(<rs type="software">SPSS/PC</rs>; SPSS, Chicago, IL). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
After the completeness and consistency of the 
quantitative data were checked on the printed form 
of the questionnaire, it was cleaned, coded and 
entered into <rs id="software-0" type="software">EpiData</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 3.02</rs>. The data analysis 
was performed by using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 16.0</rs> statis-
tical package for analysis. Descriptive statistics were 
used to show the prevalence of colostrum avoidance 
practices, reason for discarding colostrum and the 
mother's awareness on the advantages of colostrum. 
Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses 
were carried out to identify the factors associated 
with colostrum avoidance. Variables found statistic-
ally significant at p-value &lt;0.25 [15] during binary 
logistic regression analysis were included in the 
multivariable logistic regression model. Both crude 
and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were reported 
with 95% confidence interval (CI). Variables at p-
value &lt;0.05 in the final multivariable model were 
concluded as factors associated with colostrum 
avoidance. 
Qualitative data were transcribed into English text 
by the principal investigator. Thematic framework 
analysis approach was used to analyze the qualitative 
data. Finally, the result was presented in triangula-
tion with the quantitative findings. </p>

<p>three groups (n=30) according to the surface treatment 
they received (37% H 3 PO 4 , 24% H 2 O 2 , distilled water). 
Each group was further divided into 3 sub-groups (n=10) 
based on the time period of etchant application (15 sec-
onds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds). In H 3 PO 4 group, gel (Etch 
gel, DentoInc., St. Paul, MN, USA) was applied over entire 
surface of the post; in other two groups posts were 
immersed in respective solutions; all posts were then treat-
ed with distilled water and air dried. Etched posts are then 
luted into the root canals using Rely X Unicem-2 Clicker 
(3M ESPE AG, Seefeld, Germany) and light activated 
through cervical portion for 40 second (Blue phase C8, 
Ivoclar vivident, Schaan, Liechtenstein). The specimens 
were then stored for 24 hours at 37ºC in distilled water. 
Following storage, each specimen was sectioned into six 
slices of 2 mm each using diamond saw under water cool-
ant. The first two represent the coronal; second two middle 
and last two represent the apical regions of the root. The 
apical side of each specimen was marked with an indelible 
marker and each section was subjected to push out test 
from apical to coronal side in Universal testing machine 
(Autograph AG 15, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) where the 
loading was performed at a cross head speed of 0.5 mm/ 
min until post dislodged from the root slice. Schematic rep-
resentation of entire push-out test is shown in Fig. 1. 
Comparison of bond strength values were done using 
Repeated measures of ANOVA (<rs id="software-0" type="software">IBM SPSS statistics</rs> for 
Windows, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 21.0</rs>, Armonk, NY, USA) and pair wise 
comparison was done by Tukey multiple post hoc test at a 
significance level at P&lt;.05. 
Twenty seven fiber posts were taken and divided into 3 
groups (n=9) based on the surface treatment (H 3 PO 4 , 
H 2 O 2 , distilled water). Each group was subdivided into 
three (n=3) based on the time period of etchant application 
(15, 30, 60 seconds). After etching all specimens were 
cleaned ultrasonically for 5 min. in deionoized water, fol-
lowed by immersion in 96% ethanol and gently air dried. 
The posts were then gold sputtered (model JFC-1600, </p>

<p>alignment. After spotting the arrays were quality controlled on a GenePix4000b 
(Molecular Devices). The arrays were then aligned to a microfluidic device by 
hand on a SMZ1500 (Nikon) stereoscope and bonded overnight in the dark on 
a heated plate at 40 1C. 
Surface chemistry (Supplementary Fig. 1c online). All devices were driven 
between 10 and 15 p.s.i. in the control line and between 4 and 6 p.s.i. for the 
flow line. For the initial surface-derivatization steps the chamber valves 
remained closed to prevent liquid from entering the chambers containing the 
spotted RNA targets. First, all accessible surface area was derivatized by flowing 
a solution of biotinylated BSA (Pierce) resuspended to 2 mg/ml in dH 2 O for 
30 min through all channels, followed by a 10 min PBS wash. Next a 500 mg/ml 
neutravidin (Pierce) solution in PBS was flowed for 20 min, followed by a 
10 min PBS wash. Next, the button membrane was closed and the PBS wash 
continued for an additional 5 min. Then all remaining accessible surface area 
except for the circular area of 60 mm masked by the button was passivated with 
the same biotinylated solution as above for 30 min, followed by a 10 min PBS 
wash. Finally a 1:1 solution ofbiotinylated-5-histidine antibody (Qiagen) in 2% 
BSA in PBS was loaded for 2-5 min, after which the button membrane was 
opened and flow continued for 20 min allowing specific functionalization of 
the previously masked circular area. This was again followed by a 10 min PBS 
wash completing the surface derivatization procedure. 
Protein synthesis and MITOMI. Next a standard 25 ml TNT T7-coupled 
wheat germ extract mixture (Promega) was prepared and spiked with 1 ml 
tRNALys-bodipy-fl (Promega) and 2 ml of plasmid DNA template coding for 
the appropriate protein (HuR, HuD or Gus). The mixture was immediately 
loaded into the device and flushed for 5 min, after which the chamber valves 
were opened allowing for dead-end filling of the chambers with wheat germ 
extract. The chamber valves were again closed and flushing continued for an 
additional 5 min. Next the segregation valves separating each unit cell were 
closed followed by opening of the chamber valves allowing for equilibration of 
the unit cell by diffusion. The entire device was heated to 30 1C on a 
temperature-controlled microscope stage and incubated for up to 90 min to 
complete protein synthesis, binding of protein to the surface-bound biotiny-
lated-5-histidine antibody, solvation of target RNA, and equilibration of 
proteins and target RNA. MITOMI was then performed by closing the button 
membrane as well as the chamber valves allowing trapping surface-bound 
complexes while expelling any solution phase molecules. Radial closure pre-
vents solvent pockets from forming between the two interfaces and effectively 
creates zero dead volume while preserving the equilibrium concentrations of 
the molecular interactions. This was followed by a 5 min PBS wash to remove 
untrapped unbound material. The device was then imaged on a modified 
arrayWoRxe (AppliedPrecision) microarray scanner to detect protein synthesis 
and the trapped molecules. 
Image and data analysis. All images were analyzed with <rs id="software-9" type="software">GenePix</rs><rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">3.0</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>). For each experiment an image was taken after MITOMI 
and the final PBS wash. This was used to determine the concentration of 
surface-bound protein (FITC channel) as well as surface-bound target RNA 
(Cy3 channel). Each unit cell generated a single data point that consisted of the 
ratio of median signal of Cy3 to median signal of bodipy; thus, representing the 
ratio of surface-bound RNA to surface-bound expressed protein. Data from 
multiple data points were averaged and their s.d. calculated. Results were then 
normalized to 1. Between 10 and 20 replicates were included for each probe 
tested. A control protein, Gus-his (Roche) was included in each experiment and 
subjected to the same analysis. When present, detected signal with Gus-his was 
used for background subtraction. 
For membrane-associated proteins. Detection of RNA binding by NS4B 
was done as described except for the following modifications. NS4B was 
expressed off the microfluidic device by using a coupled transcription/ 
translation rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega). We added 2 ml canine 
microsomal membranes (Promega) to the reaction mixture to allow appro-
priate protein folding. An NS4B-GFP construct was used thus eliminating 
the need for tRNALysÀbodipyÀfl in the reaction mixture. A biotinylated 
anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) was used to specifically functionalize the 
protected circular area defined by the button. The protein was anchored to 
the chip via its interaction with the surface-bound anti-GFP antibodies. 
The surface-bound protein and the Cy5-labeled HCV RNA probes were loaded 
into the chip and allowed to incubate for 5-20 min in a 50-mM HEPES KOH </p>

<p>assay substrate and measured luciferase activity using a Berthold LB 96 V 
luminometer. As above, signal was normalized relative to untreated samples or 
samples grown in the presence of the corresponding concentration of DMSO. 
Luciferase activity detected in samples treated with 100 u/ml interferon a B2 
(PBL Biomedical Labs) was used as a positive control, demonstrating three log 
reduction at 72 h treatment. The experiment was repeated four times, each time 
with triplicates. IC 50 s were measured by fitting data to a three-parameter 
logistic curve using the formula Y ¼ a+(b -a)/(1 + 10^(X -c)) (<rs id="software-5" type="software">BioDataFit</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Chang Bioscience</rs>). </p>

<p>Whole-cell RNA electroporation. Whole-cell RNA was extracted from clem-
izole-resistant replicon clones and from untreated replicon cells using TRIzol 
reagent. Equal amounts of whole cell RNA (50 mg) were electroporated into 
Huh7.5 cells, as described above. Cells were grown under G418 selection 
in the presence or absence of clemizole for 3 weeks. The number of colonies 
was determined using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Image J</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>) following fixation 
and staining with crystal violet. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. Dissociation equilibrium constants were determined by 
fitting data to the equation describing equilibrium binding; Y ¼ a Â X/(b + X) 
(a and b represent maximum binding and K d , respectively) by nonlinear least-
squares regression fitting (<rs id="software-7" type="software">BioDataFit</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-7" type="creator">Chang Bioscience</rs>). IC 50 s were measured 
by fitting data to a three-parameter logistic curve using the formula Y ¼ a + 
(b -a)/(1 + 10^(X -c)) (a, b and c represent minimum binding, maximum 
binding and logEC 50 , respectively)(<rs id="software-8" type="software">BioDataFit</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Chang Bioscience</rs>). </p>

<p>Cells were grown on glass coverslips to a density of 50-70% conflu-
ence, and coverslips were mounted in a chamber filled with DMEM 
supplemented with 10% FCS. Temperature was maintained at 37 ± 
2ºC with an Air Stream Incubator (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Time-
lapse epifluorescence microscopy was carried out on an Axiophot 
microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63× 1.4 NA 
objective. Images were captured with a Micromax 782Y cooled 
CCD camera (Roper Scientific) driven by <rs type="software">WinView32</rs> software 
or with a AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss) driven by <rs id="software-1" type="software">AxioVizion</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">4.6</rs> 
(Zeiss) software. The frames were collected every 4 s with an expo-
sure time of 0.5-1.0 s. To minimize phototoxic damage, a 100 W 
halogen lamp was used as a light source for fluorescent imaging 
of live cells. </p>

<p>Image analysis was performed as described earlier (Minin et al., 
2006) using an open source image analysis software, <rs id="software-2" type="software">ImageJ</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</rs>). Because of the diverse morphology of 
mitochondria, we plotted the coordinates of one end for longer 
organelles and the center of mass for shorter ones. Mitochondrial 
motility was expressed in terms of the displacement distances and 
velocities. To define fast organelle movements, we applied a 
threshold of 200 nm/s. The values of the relative motility of mito-
chondria were expressed as mean percentages of fast movements 
in all recorded displacements ± SEM. In each experiment, 20-40 
individual mitochondrial movements were analyzed in each of 
10-15 cells. The significance of differences was estimated statisti-
cally by the paired-sample Student's t test. Variability of the values 
calculated for different cells in the samples was analyzed by the 
same method and was insignificant. </p>

<p>The perimeter of the labial curve was traced from the 
gingival margin to the incisal edge. A straight line connect-
ing the gingival margin and the incisal edge called the 
proximal line was then drawn (Fig. 1). The distance (L2) 
from the proximal line to the labial curve at the mid point 
was then obtained using the 'length' option within the <rs id="software-2" type="software">Image 
Pro Plus</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 4</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Media Cybernetics</rs>, UK). Simi-
larly, the most prominent point of the labial curve to the 
proximal line was obtained by drawing a tangent parallel to 
the proximal line using the length option (L3). The point at 
which the tangent was the greatest length from the labial 
curve was the most prominent point. The vertical distance 
between L2 and L3 along the proximal line was determined 
(L4). L4 was measured and was either negative or positive in 
value, according to the position of the most prominent point 
being incisal or gingival respectively to the mid-point (Fig.

<rs type="software">DiscoverText</rs> requires no text preprocessing prior to coding. This

tweets were defined by presence of any of the following: branded 
promotional messages; URLs linking to commercial websites;

<p>Normally distributed quantitative variables are expressed 
as means and standard deviations. Nonparametric variables 
are expressed as median, minimum, and maximum values. 
Differences in the distribution of selected characteristics 
between patient groups were examined using the chi-square 
test and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. The 
analysis was performed using Student's t-test for normally 
distributed continuous variables and the Mann-Whitney 
and Kruskal-Wallis tests for nonparametric variables. 
Variables associated with wall location and events in 
univariate analysis (P , 0.10) were included in the multi-
variate analyses. Continuous variables were used as 
dichotomous variables to facilitate clinical interpretation 
and standardize the multivariate analysis. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine 
the area under the curve (AUC) or the c statistic; the cut-off 
point for BNP and other continuous variables with the best 
predictive value was used for wall location and cardiac 
events. A multiple logistic regression model was used for 
the selection of variables predictive of involvement of the 
anterior wall and for the occurrence of in-hospital events 
during index admission. Cox multivariate regression was 
used for the selection of independent prognostic factors 
of mortality and any follow-up events. Two-sided P 
values , 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All 
statistical analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical

In order to investigate the dependence of the 
detection of LNM on the size of tumor deposits in 
LNM, we selected LNM for which we could establish 
a direct link: the LNM from PET-positive subregions 
with a single LNM (LNM was detected), and the LNM 
from PET-negative subregions (LNM were not 
detected). 
However, 
to 
ensure 
sufficient 
comparability, we restricted the latter to subregions 
with maximally two LNMs. For these LNMs we 
determined longitudinal and short diameters of LNM 
and tumor deposits. We then modeled the detection of 
the LNM by PET as a function of the diameter using a 
logistic regression model in <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> ® <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 14.1</rs>,

<p>Background: The Motricity Index was used to measure strength in upper and lower extremities after stroke. 
The weighted score based on the ordinal 6 point scale of Medical Research Council was used to measure maxi-
mal isometric muscle strength. There is dearth of articles dealing with the reliability of this method. Therefore, 
the aim of this study was to determine the test retest reliability of Motricity Index strength assessments for paret-
ic lower limb in 20 chronic stroke patients with one week interval. 
Methods: In a cross sectional study, intrarater reliability of lower extremity Motricity Index strength assess-
ments with one week interval were measured. 
Result: The <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18</rs> was used for analysis of data. Two-way random-consistency model of ICC was used for 
assessment of test-retest reliability. The ICC values showed high reliability of strength measurement of 
Motricity Index (ICC=0.93). 
Conclusion: The Motricity Index can be a reliable instrument for measuring the strength of involved lower ex-
tremity when assessment is done by one rater following chronic stroke. </p>

<p>R-loopDB (http://rloop.bii.a-star.edu.sg) was origi-
nally constructed as a collection of computationally 
predicted R-loop forming sequences (RLFSs) in the 
human genic regions. The renewed R-loopDB pro-
vides updates, improvements and new options, in-
cluding access to recent experimental data. It in-
cludes genome-scale prediction of RLFSs for hu-
mans, six other animals and yeast. Using the ex-
tended quantitative model of RLFSs (QmRLFS), we 
significantly increased the number of RLFSs pre-
dicted in the human genes and identified RLFSs in 
other organism genomes. R-loopDB allows search-
ing of RLFSs in the genes and in the 2 kb up-
stream and downstream flanking sequences of any 
gene. R-loopDB exploits the <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> gene annota-
tion system, providing users with chromosome co-
ordinates, sequences, gene and genomic data of 
the 1 565 795 RLFSs distributed in 121 056 genic 
or proximal gene regions of the covered organisms. 
It provides a comprehensive annotation of Ensembl 
RLFS-positive genes including 93 454 protein coding 
genes, 12 480 long non-coding RNA and 7 568 small 
non-coding RNA genes and 7 554 pseudogenes. Us-
ing new interface and genome viewers of R-loopDB, 
users can search the gene(s) in multiple species with 
keywords in a single query. R-loopDB provides tools 
to carry out comparative evolution and genome-scale 
analyses in R-loop biology. </p>

<p>predictions, several recent genome-wide experimental stud-
ies mapped thousands of RNA:DNA hybridization signals 
distributed along human and mouse genomes and demon-
strated that R-loops can be formed not only in the gene 
body but also in the upstream promoter regions (9-11) and 
transcription pause sites located downstream of the poly(A) 
signal (9,10,12,13,19). Formation of these R-loops in prox-
imal promoter regions was shown to be involved in tran-
scription initiation or elongation (9) and the recruitment of 
key pluripotency regulators (11). R-loops forming in tran-
scription termination sites could promote termination by 
slowing down the advance of the RNA polymerase II and 
allowing the recruitment of termination factors (13). Inter-
estingly, such co-localization of R-loops with key regula-
tory regions was not limited to humans but also found or 
predicted in many other species (7,20,21). 
Previously, we have presented <rs type="software">QmRLFS-finder</rs>, a tool us-
ing an updated quantitative model of RLFS (QmRLFS) 
model that has predicted the RLFS locations in ∼75% 
of the human genes (22). This tool allowed a higher ac-
curacy, precision and strand specificity of the QmRLFS-
based predictions of the R-loops in the proximal pro-
moter and downstream transcription termination site re-
gions (7,20). Soon after the publication of the R-loopDB, 
the DNA:RNA immune-precipitation coupled to high-
throughput sequencing (DRIP-seq) data became available 
(9,23). Ginno et al. (9) have improved the initial DRIP-seq 
method (23) and reported detection of 4181 RNA:DNA hy-
brid regions. In (22), we reported that RLFS predicted by 
<rs type="software">QmRLFS-finder</rs> overlapped with 79.2% of DRIP-seq re-
gions defined by Ginno et al. (9). In a comparison of the 
frequencies of experimentally defined R-loops with those 
RLFSs predicted by QmRLFS-finder, our tool showed 91% 
accuracy, 94% sensitivity and 75% specificity (22). 
Recently, new high-throughput technologies for detec-
tion of RNA:DNA hybrid formation and new data sets 
became available, which provide an opportunity to specify 
prevalence, strand specificity and chromosome distribution 
of R-loops in the human and mouse genomes, their conser-
vation across cell types and species, their mechanisms of for-
mation and turnover and specify their functions (12,14,24). 
The new version of R-loopDB, based on the predic-
tions by <rs type="software">QmRLFS-finder</rs> (22), includes several key im-
provements and extensions that facilitate exploration of the 
RLFS analysis. We updated the identification of RLFSs 
in the human genome and provided for the first time the 
genome-scale prediction of RLFSs in seven additional or-
ganisms. The updated R-loopDB allows the user to search 
for gene(s) containing RLFSs not only in genic regions but 
also in 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking sequence of 
the gene, termed 'RLFS-positive genes'. Compared to the 
previous R-loopDB version, we now use Ensembl gene an-
notation system that contains information on protein cod-
ing genes, pseudogenes, long noncoding RNA genes and 
short noncoding RNA genes (25). Mapping of RLFSs and 
other genomic regulatory sequences is graphically visual-
ized in <rs type="software">Gbrowse2</rs> (26) and <rs type="software">UCSC genome browser</rs> (27). 
In the case of the human and mouse genomes, the exper-
imentally detected RNA:DNA hybrid data (9,12,14,24) on 
the genome scale were integrated into the genomics view-
ers. That allows users to carry out comprehensive compar-</p>

<p>We collected all genome assembly data from the <rs id="software-18" type="software">UCSC 
genome browser</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-18" type="url">https://genome.ucsc.edu</rs>/) (27). The hu-
man genome hg19 (NCBI build GRCh37) was used as the 
reference genome in this database. We also analyzed ge-
nomic data of selected model organisms including Mus 
musculus (mm10), Rattus norvegicus (rn5), Pan troglodytes 
(panTro4), Gallus gallus (galGal4), Xenopus tropicalis (xen-
Tro3), Drosophila melanogaster (dm5) and Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae (saccer3). Only the reference chromosomes were 
used in this study. Therefore, we excluded other sequence 
regions such as unlocalized and unplaced scaffolds, su-
percontigs, assembly patches and alternate loci (haplo-
types). Gene annotation data for these organisms was re-
trieved directly from <rs id="software-19" type="software">MySQL</rs> server of BioMart database 
build 75 (ensembl mart 75; <rs corresp="#software-19" type="url">http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/mysql.html</rs>) (25). Genomic information of the gene 
structures for these organisms (GTF format) was down-
loaded from <rs id="software-20" type="software">Ensembl</rs> <rs corresp="#software-20" type="version-number">Release 75</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-20" type="url">http://feb2014.archive.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp</rs>/; accessed 1 April 2016). </p>

<p>We predicted R-loop structures on both strands of genomic 
DNA using <rs type="software">QmRLFS-finder</rs> (22). After obtaining RLFSs, 
we collected RLFSs located in the genic region and 2 kb up-
stream and downstream flanking regions of each gene using 
<rs type="software">BEDTools</rs> (28). RLFSs that overlapped by at least one nu-
cleotide were merged into unique RLFS clusters. When no 
further RLFSs overlapped the long merged sequence, then 
this sequence, called an RLFS-merged region, has reached 
its maximum length. Such regions were reported, counted 
and made visible in the updated R-loopDB. 
RLFSs that are located in any genic region were con-
sidered gene-associated RLFS. We determined locations of 
RLFSs on the 2 kb upstream, genic (gene body) and 2 
kb downstream regions. RLFSs that are located simultane-
ously in any genic combination of these three regions were 
also identified and counted. </p>

<p>R-loopDB currently covers eight organisms, including hu-
man, mouse, rat, chimpanzee, chicken, frog, fruit fly and 
yeast. Supplementary Table S1 provides information on 
the genome assemblies of these species. Using <rs type="software">QmRLFS-
finder</rs> (22), we significantly extended the list of RLFSs and 
RLFS-positive genes in the human genome compared to 
the previous version (18). The summary statistics of RLFSs, 
RLFS-merged regions and RLFS-positive genes presented 
in the previous and updated R-loopDBs are shown in Ta-
ble 1. For instance, 511 651 RLFSs (or 169 222 RLFS-
merged regions) were computationally predicted in genic 
regions and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking re-
gions of the genes, whereas, in the previous R-loopDB, 245 
181 RLFSs (or 140 106 RLFS-merged regions) were found 
in the UCSC-defined gene regions. In total, R-loopDB 
provides chromosome coordinates, sequences and genomic 
data of 1565 795 RLFSs distributed across 121 056 genes 
and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking region of the 
genes of eight organisms. 
Using the <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> gene annotation system (25) in R-
loopDB, RLFS-positive genes can be classified into 93 454 
protein-coding genes, 7 554 pseudogenes, 12 480 long non-
coding RNA genes and 7 568 short non-coding RNA genes 
(Table 2). </p>

<p>Visual tools for RLFS search could be used for locating pu-
tative R-loops in a specific region of genic or gene-proximal 
regions for further experimental design and validation of 
the computational prediction(s). Here, we redesigned the in-
terface of R-loopDB to search genes containing RLFS in 
multiple organisms with a single search. The genes contain-
ing RLFS can be retrieved from the database using several 
search options, e.g. keywords, <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> gene ID or <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> 
transcript ID, gene symbol, gene description, Entrez ID, 
Refseq ID, gene biotype and synonyms (Figure 1A). Note 
that the keywords option will search the query input string 
against all terms in the database. The gene search query re-
turns RLFS-positive genes (Figure 1B). Each Ensembl gene 
ID of the search result is linked to the result gene page that 
provides information in two parts 'Gene Overview' (Figure 
1C) and 'Genomic Location' (Figure 2). 
The 'Gene Overview' provides detailed information of 
the Ensembl gene (Figure 1C.i) and RLFS-merged regions 
within proximal gene regions (Figure 1C.ii). Here, NEAT1 
gene encodes a nuclear long non-coding RNA. Accord-
ing to its annotation, NEAT1 RNA is essential for the 
formation and maintenance of nuclear structures called 
paraspeckles and is involved in cell malignancy. The gene 
information panel (Figure 1C.i) shows the gene annotation 
of a given <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> gene ID retrieved from the BioMart 
database (build 75), i.e. gene description, gene biotype, 
chromosome location, Ensembl transcript ID, Entrez ID 
and RefSeq ID, while gene synonyms were retrieved from 
the Ensembl database (build 84). In RLFS-merged region 
information (Figure 1C.ii; also see Figure 2a), this table pro-
vides a list of RLFS-merged regions located in the genic re-
gion and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions </p>

<p>of the particular gene. Each RLFS-merged region has use-
ful information for supporting the R-loop forming poten-
tial, such as (i) the number of RLFSs, and (ii) strand and 
(iii) statistics of the GC skew value. To find RLFS candi-
dates for experimental validation, we recommend that users 
consider the information in the RLFS-merged region table 
(Figure 1C.ii). The first one is the 'number of RLFSs'. A 
higher number of RLFSs in the RLFS-merged region im-
plies a higher propensity of R-loop initiation and forma-
tion in a given locus. The second one is 'strand'. According 
to the R-loop definition where a nascent RNA is hybridized 
with a DNA template, predicted RLFS are located on the 
same strand as the transcribed gene (Supplementary Fig-
ure S1). The third one is 'statistics of GC skew value'. GC 
skew value was calculated at the whole genomic scale, as 
shown in Figure 2c. The 'statistics of GC skew value' show 
statistics of GC skew value in each RLFS-merged region in-
cluding minimum, maximum, mean and median. GC skew 
maximum values &gt; 0.1 (for plus strand) or GC skew min-
imum values &lt; −0.1 (for minus strand) are considered G-
rich regions (21). The more G-rich an RLFS-merged region 
is, the more likely it is to increase the thermodynamic stabil-
ity of R-loop formation (24). In the case of the human and 
mouse genomes, 'DRIP/RDIP support' and 'DRIPc sup-
port' columns, which indicate the number of RNA:DNA 
hybrid detection experiments for each RLFS-merged re-
gion, are provided. There are at least nine RNA:DNA hy-
brid detection experiments including four DRIP-seq stud-
ies in Ntera2, one DRIP-seq in K562, one DRIP-seq in 
primary fibroblast cells (9,12,14), two RDIP-seq studies in 
IMR-90 and HEK293T cells (24) and one DRIPc-seq in 
Ntera2. Individually, these experiments showed variations 
in the sequence overlap region boundaries, their locations 
and the sequence cluster overlap peak heights, however, 
collectively they often demonstrate the patterns converged 
on the theoretical predictions. A combination of computa-
tional predictions and biological data sets suggests a role 
of NEAT1-associated R-loops in an aberrant NEAT1 tran-
scription initiation and/or 3-end elongation isoform syn-
theses, leading to modulation of the paraspeckle formation 
and cell malignancy. 
The RLFS or RLFS-merged region results can be down-
loaded into text file, BED file and FASTA file (Figure 
1C.iii). 
The top panel of the 'Genomic Location' result shows 
gene name, gene location, strand and cytoband information 
of the particular gene (see in Figure 2). New genomics visu-
alization has been integrated into R-loopDB using embed-
ded Gbrowse2. The genomics viewer provides visualization 
of RLFS-merged, RLFS, CpG Island, GC skew profile, En-
sembl genes, <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> transcripts, DRIP-seq profile, RDIP-
seq profile and DRIPc-seq profile in a particular genic re-
gion as well as in 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking 
regions of the gene. In Figure 2a-d, the light blue and pink 
colors indicate the orientation of the sense-and antisense-
strand of the annotations, respectively. Clicking on an in-
dividual RLFS-merged (Figure 2a) or RLFS (Figure 2b) 
will link to the detailed information of RLFS-merged (Sup-
plementary Figure S2A) or RLFS (Supplementary Figure 
S2B), respectively. GC skew profile (Figure 2c) indicates the 
boundaries between the bias distributions of G-rich regions </p>

<p>in a sense-or antisense-strand of the chromosome. Clicking 
on an individual Ensembl gene or Ensembl transcript (Fig-
ure 2d) will result in a close-up view of the particular gene 
or transcript. In Figure 2e and f, DRIP-seq, RDIP-seq and 
DRIPc-seq peak regions indicate significant enrichment of 
DRIP-seq, RDIP-seq and DRIPc-seq signals, respectively, 
from different studies of experimental RNA:DNA hybrid 
detection. R-loopDB also provides external browser but-
tons which are linked to interactive genomics viewers such 
as <rs type="software">UCSC Genome Browser</rs> (27) and <rs type="software">GBrowse2</rs> (26) (Sup-
plementary Figure S3). Furthermore, users can directly in-
put the gene coordinate or gene symbol on UCSC Genome 
Browser for searching. Users have the option to turn on/off 
or re-order the tracks that are displayed on the genome 
browser. </p>

<p>tors underlying secondary genetic lesions frequently seen in 
precursor B leukemia (30). RNA:DNA hybrids are being 
increasingly associated with human diseases, with a major 
concern that their presence predisposes a locus to chromo-
somal breakage (7,8). 
The updated R-loopDB could be utilized not only as a 
predictive model resource but also as an analytical tool to 
predict and validate many RLFS-positive genes (as coding 
and non-coding for proteins), pseudogenes to test the spe-
cific hypotheses in R-loop biology, to improve the existing 
methods, to design new experimental studies and to provide 
an adequate interpretation of the experimental and theoret-
ical results. In those contexts, a combination of R-loopDB 
and <rs type="software">QmRLFS-finder</rs> web server (identifying RLFSs in non-
annotated and artificial targeting sequences) might be use-
ful. 
Further development of R-loopDB will be focused on 
classification of RLFS and R-loops, evolutionary conser-
vation and de novo RLFSs and the RLFS-positive genes in 
different gene families and subsets, cell types and organisms. 
We plan to develop and integrate the options to retrieve 
evolutionarily conserved and unique RLFS-positive genes, 
searching across several mammalian and non-mammalian 
genomes in the R-loopDB. As more experimental R-loop 
data sets are generated, in the next update, R-loopDB 
should offer a more comprehensive collection of experimen-
tally supported data and further development of the inte-
grative and predictive tools. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
All results are expressed as mean±SD, and significance was defined as a p value of &lt;0.05. 
The analysis was done by using PASW statistics <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18</rs> (SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium testing was performed by using the X 
2 test. Student's t test and multivariate

<p>extraction from tissues was performed with the NucliSens 
easyMAG platform (BioMérieux, Rome, Italy), according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. Human papillomavirus DNA detec-
tion was performed with the Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay 
(Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), which allows the detection of 18 
HPV genotypes, and can differentiate between HR HPV (types 16, 
18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59 and 68) and low-risk (LR) HPV 
(types 6, 11, 42, 43 and 44), but does not allow the identification of 
specific genotypes. 
As for RNA, samples were analysed for HPV E6 and E7 mRNA 
by NucliSENS EasyQ HPV v.1 test (BioMérieux, Rome, Italy), 
based on the NASBA technique. It specifically detects the E6/E7 
mRNA of five HR HPV types (HPV16/18/31/33/45); the other HR 
and LR genotypes are not detectable with this assay. Briefly, three 
premixes were made by the reconstitution of reagent spheres in the 
reagent diluent, followed by the addition of primer/molecular 
beacon mixes (either U1A/HPV16, HPV18/31 or HPV33/45). 
A measure of 10 ml of premix were distributed to each well, 
followed by 5 ml sample, and incubated for 4 min at 65 1C and 
2 min at 41 1C. The reaction was started by the addition of enzymes 
and measured in real time using the EasyQ analyser 
at 41 1C. Data analysis was performed using the <rs type="software">EasyQ Director</rs> 
software. </p>

The agreement among detection methods was quantified by 
calculating k, which is a measure of agreement and takes on the 
value zero if there is no more agreement between test and outcome 
than can be expected on the basis of chance. It is considered that 
k values o0.4 represent poor agreement, values between 0.4 and 
0.75 fair to good agreement and values 40.75 excellent agreement. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the program 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 14</rs>. The sample's characteristics were de-

appropriate, Mann-Whitney test were used for quantitative 
variables, and Spearman and Pearson's correlations for ordi-
nal variables. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test (whenever 
chi-square assumptions were not met) were calculated for 
nominal variables. To assess the effect of past variables on 
current psychological distress and its detection by physicians 
and nurses, multiple logistic regression was carried out. </p>

<p>Methods for interpretation of the LV and RV measures 
have been previously reported. 
[15,16] Briefly, RV image 
analysis was performed by two independent analysts 
on Windows workstations using <rs id="software-0" type="software">QMASS software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v4.2</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Medis</rs>, The Netherlands). The endocardial and epicardial 
borders of the RV were traced manually on short-axis 
cine images at end-diastole and end-systole. Papillary 
muscles and trabeculae were included in the RV volumes 
and excluded from RV mass. 
[17] RVEDV and RVESV were 
calculated using Simpson's rule by summation of areas 
on each slice multiplied by the sum of slice thickness and 
image gap. RV mass was determined at end-diastole as the 
difference between end-diastolic epicardial and endocardial 
volumes multiplied by the specific gravity of the heart 
(1.05 g/cm </p>

<p>The images were acquired using an Optronics Digital Camera 
connected to a computer interface (<rs type="software">MagnaFire</rs>) and an Olym-
pus BX-51 research microscope. The general structure of the 
pyramidal cells of the PC and round neurogenic cells of the 
PVZ were characterized using inter-reader variability. The total 
cell count was determined using a 10 × 10 grid graticulate at 
400X magnification. For both the corona and sagital sections, 
n = 2 fields were captured to obtain n = 4 fields per section. 
Subsequently, the average count for n = 4 fields was deter-
mined as the representative value. 
33 Immunopositive cells in 
GFAP, NSE and Ki-67IHC were counted in Image J (NIH) and cal-
culated using the method described in the previous paragraph. 
NF, CD31 and CD45 were expressed as intensity of IHC reaction 
products (+/-). The lumen and arterial wall of the MCA branch 
were measured using Open Office Draw Suite (Sun Microsys-
tems) at a magnification of 100X. The data was plotted using 
a simple ANOVA (<rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 17.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">IBM</rs>) with significance set 
at P&lt;0.05*, P&lt;0.01** and P&lt;0.001*** for total and immu-
nopositive cell counts. </p>

<p>This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, prospective 
phase II study. The primary objective of the study was to 
compare PFS associated with the use of IP and EP for the 
treatment of patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC. 
Secondary objectives were to compare the antitumor efficacy 
as assessed by ORR and OS, and to evaluate the safety and tol-
erability of each regimen. All calculations and statistical 
analyses were conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">17.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, 
IL, USA). Comparisons of analyzed parameters between 
groups were performed with the chi-square test or Fisher's 
exact test for proportional variables. Survival data were ana-
lyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves 
were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis 
of the associations between diarrhea and UGT1A1 genotype 
in the IP arm were assessed with logistic regression. Two sided 
values of P &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>Male mice with global glucagon receptor knockout and wild-type mice (19) 
were provided by M.J.C. They were housed in individual cages with constant 
temperature and 12 h of light alternating with 12 h of darkness and fed Teklad 
6% mouse/rat diet (Teklad, Madison, WI) with free access to water. The pro-
tocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory 
Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the North Texas Veterans 
Administration Medical Center. 
Chemical destruction of b-cells. b-cells were destroyed in 10-to 12-week-old 
Gcgr 
2/2 and Gcgr 
+/+ mice with two intravenous injections of STZ (100 mg/kg 
body weight followed in 7 days by 80 mg/kg). Food intake, body weight, and 
blood glucose were measured weekly for 6 weeks. 
Plasma measurements. Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucose 
meter (Bayer Healthcare, Mishawka, IN). Plasma glucagon levels were mea-
sured using a Linco glucagon RIA kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma 
insulin levels were measured using a rat/mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal 
Chem, Downers Grove, IL), and IGF-1 levels were measured using an IGF-1 
ELISA kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd., Boldon, UK). Free fatty acids 
(FFAs) were measured with a nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) kit (Waco Pure 
Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). 
Oral glucose tolerance test. After a 16 h fast, glucose (2 g/kg) was admin-
istered by gavage to the Gcgr mice. Blood was taken at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 
120 min intervals, and the blood glucose and plasma insulin were analyzed. 
Immunoblotting. Livers were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) 
buffer (0.15mM NaCl/0.05mM TrisHCl, pH,7.2/1% Triton-X100/1% sodium 
deoxycholate/0.1% SDS) with 10 mg/mL leupeptin and 10 mg/mL aprotinin. 
Proteins were resolved by sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/ 
PAGE) and transferred to a membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). 
The blotted membrane was blocked in 1 3 Tris-buffered saline (TBS) con-
taining 0.1% tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room tem-
perature. After incubation with primary antibodies to cAMP-responsive 
element binding (CREB) and phospho-CREB (P-CREB) (1:1000; Cell Signaling 
Technology, Danvers, MA) or anti-g-tubulin at 4°C overnight, the membrane 
was washed with TBST buffer. Membranes were incubated with goat anti-
rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG for 1 h. The 
proteins were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence detection system 
(GE Healthcare). 
Real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the liver by 
Trizol isolation method (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). All PCR reactions 
were performed in triplicate as previously described (25). The mRNA level was 
calculated by using standard curve method. Primer sequences are shown in 
Supplementary Table 1. 
Amino acid analysis of livers. Amino acids were analyzed in liver homoge-
nates by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). All MS analyses used stable-isotope 
dilution with internal standards from Isotec, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, and 
CDN Isotopes. 
Immunohistochemistry and b-cell mass measurement. The distal 20% of 
pancreata dissected from adult mice were fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma, St. 
Louis, MO) and dehydrated prior to paraffin embedding. Five micrometer 
contiguous paraffin sections were prepared on a Leica RM2155 rotary mi-
crotome for insulin and glucagon immunohistochemical staining, as previously 
described (26). Morphometric analysis for insulin cells was performed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Image-J</rs> image analysis software and particle analysis macro (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Scion</rs>, 
Frederick, MD). The area of insulin staining in three sections of pancreas from 
4-6 animals, relative to total sectional area examined, was quantified by 
monochromatic thresholding. </p>

<p>Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray dispersive spectroscopy. SEM sam-
ples were prepared by breaking a QDSSC anode or cathode in half. The SEM used a 
Quanta 400 field emission gun made by FEI Company. The 20 kV electron beam 
was scanned across the cross-section, and then the energy and the count of X-rays 
were measured. Elemental analysis was conducted using <rs type="software">Genesis EDX</rs> software. </p>

<p>EMSAs were performed as described (26), either with 
gel-purified single 5 
0 -end 
32 P-labelled PCR fragments or 
with purified 47-bp duplexes generated by annealing of 
complementary oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table 
S1), of which one was 5 
0 -end labelled with [g-
32 P]-ATP 
by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unless otherwise stated, sep-
aration of free DNA from DNA-protein complexes was 
performed on 6 and 8% polyacrylamide gels for the PCR 
fragments and 47-bp duplexes, respectively. LysM-binding 
reactions were performed in LrpB binding buffer as 
described previously (27) with 25 mg ml 
À1 sonicated 
herring sperm DNA as non-specific competitor. 
EMSA autoradiographs were scanned with a Microtek 
Bio-5000 scanner, and binding equilibrium association 
constants (K A s) were determined with the <rs type="software">Densitometric 
Image Analysis Software</rs>, for which a description will be 
published elsewhere. To enable comparison of K A s 
measured at different times, relative K A s were determined 
by normalization with the K A for binding to the consensus 
sequence fragment, measured each time in parallel. In-gel

<p>Micro-array data analysis was performed using an 
extended version of the programme described by (36), 
which uses the Ringo package of <rs type="software">R-Bioconductor</rs> 
(37).The source code of the extended programme is 
made available through http://micr.vub.ac.be. It includes 
importing data, data quality assessment, pre-processing of 
data, identifying ChIP-enriched regions (chers) and 
determining significant differences between experiments 
with and without lysine. To avoid detection of peaks in 
the log 2 ratios due to reduced signal-to-noise ratios at low-
intensity probes, as part of the pre-processing step, 
average log 2 intensities over red and green channels are 
calculated for each probe, and probes with resulting values 
smaller than the average minus twice the standard devi-
ation are replaced by missing values. Next, a standard 
normalization step is performed in which Tukey's 
biweight mean across each sample's log 2 ratios is sub-
tracted from individual log 2 ratios, and resulting values 
are averaged over replicates and smoothed over a 100-bp 
window to reduce stochastic noise and systematic noise 
due to differences in hybridization efficiency of different 
probes. 
A region was considered as ChIP-enriched if smoothed 
log 2 ratios of all reporters mapped to this region exceed a 
threshold of 2 and if the region contains at least five 
probe-matched positions, each of these positions being 
&lt;500 bp apart from another matched position within 
this region. A constant threshold of 2 was chosen rather 
than the more statistically inspired version used by (36) to 
maintain an almost constant number of detected chers 
across biological replicates, rather than ensuring that the 
number of detected false-positives is smaller than a certain 
amount. The resulting chers were extended at both sides 
with 150 bp, and overlapping chers were then combined 
into one cher. This additional step was necessary to make 
sure that a cher is only detected once: sometimes a cher 
could be detected more than once due to, for example, a 
single reporter level that is under the threshold, whereas a 
series of neighbouring reporter levels are above the 
threshold. </p>

<p>Salivary statherin levels were determined using a previously 
described method with some modification [6,30]. Saliva (PS and SS) 
samples were thawed and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) 
was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to minimize aggregate 
formation. Following a series of pilot experiments, the volume of saliva 
required to obtain an optimal statherin signal in the immunoblot analy-
sis was found to be 0.125 μL for both control and diabetic samples. Total 
protein content of the saliva was determined by measuring absorbance 
at 215 nm using a DU® spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) 
[26]. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. 
Saliva samples were separated on precast 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels 
(Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA) and then 
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp, 
Bedford, MA). The membranes were immunoblotted with a primary 
antibody against human statherin (1:2000 dilution; STATH Polyclonal 
Antibody [catalog #19724-1-AP], Proteintech, IL, USA) at 4°C overnight, 
followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary 
antibody (1:10,000) (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, PA, USA). The 
statherin immunoreactive band was visualized using an ECL detection 
kit (ECL Advance™ Western Blotting Detection Kit, GE Healthcare, Buck-
inghamshire, UK) and band images were acquired and analyzed with an 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">AutoChemi</rs> system (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">UVP, Inc.</rs>., CA, USA). Gray-scale values for statherin-
positive bands were quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Cor-
poration, MD, USA). </p>

<p>A power analysis was performed using the statistical software, 
<rs id="software-4" type="software">G*Power</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 3.1.9.2</rs>) [8,9] to determine the appropriate number 
of subjects to include in the study. The Mann-Whitney U-test was 
used for comparing data from control and diabetic subjects. Spearman's 
rank correlation coefficient was used for the test of correlation between 
statherin level and HbA1c and blood glucose levels. These statistical 
analyses were carried out using PASW Statistics 17.0 software (SPSS, 
Inc., IL, USA). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. </p>

<p>Fig. 1. Statherin levels in the saliva of patients with diabetes and healthy age-and gender-matched controls as measured by immunoblot analysis. Stimulated parotid saliva (PS) and sublingual/ 
submandibular saliva (SS) were collected as described in Materials and methods section and then subjected to 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting for statherin, and 
quantification using <rs type="software">Scion Image</rs> software. Panel A: a representative gel of salivary statherin in 0.125 μL saliva (PS and SS) collected from diabetic patients and controls. ST: prescreened PS sample 
used for quantitation (see Materials and methods section). Panel B: statherin levels in saliva were determined by converting the stained region of the immunoblot (for each sample) into a 
density value. The relative statherin level was expressed as the ratio of statherin band density for an individual subject to the standard PS sample run on each gel. The box plots show the 
1st and 3rd quartiles, median (horizontal line between the 1st and 3rd quartiles) and outliers (open circles) [more than 1.5× (3rd-1st quartiles)]. </p>

<p>FACS-based cytotoxicity assay. To measure cytotoxicity, EL4 thymoma 
target cells were loaded with 0 or 1 μ M Gp33 peptide for 2 h before a 2-h 
coincubation with P14 CD8 + T cells at the eff ector-to-target ratios indi-
cated in the fi gures in 96-well round-bottom plates. After the coincubation 
period, cells were stained with Annexin V -FITC and anti-CD8 -allophyco-
cyanin. Data analysis was performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">FlowJo</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Tree Star, Inc.</rs>.); 
EL4 target cells (CD8-negative events) were gated, and the percentage of 
Annexin V + target cells was determined. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis was conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">24</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, United States). All data are presented 
as absolute and relative frequencies and reported

<p>Statistical methods 
Demographics and clinical characteristics of participants 
are reported in frequency and proportions for categor-
ical variables, and means and SDs for continuous vari-
ables. Gender difference in these variables was assessed 
using Fisher exact tests, χ 
2 tests or two-sample t tests 
when appropriate. The same approach compared 
female participants between SUDDEN victims and total 
deceased in Wake County and in the living population 
of Wake County. EMS reports, clinical risk factors and 
cause of death on death certificate were compared 
between male and female SUDDEN subjects and 
reported as ORs with 95% CIs. Subgroup analysis, strati-
fied by coronary disease as the cause of death, was con-
ducted to explore the difference in death age between 
males and females. All of the analyses were conducted 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc</rs>). We consider two-
sided p value &lt;0.05 statistically significant. 
Prior to the analysis, a power analysis determined a 
total number of 170 participants (85 males and 85 
females), assuming an OR of females as 2.5%, and 40% 
among those participants with a positive outcome are 
males, under 0.05 type I error probability and 0.8 statis-
tical power. </p>

measured and displayed automatically by the system itself. After 
the blast, new peaks appeared indicating to formation of new areas 
with blood. The acoustic signal is amplified by a low-noise 40 dB 
second-stage amplifier and recorded by a high-speed digitizer (NI 
USB-5132, National Instruments, Austin, TX) at 8 bits resolution 
and 50 MS/s. The operator interface is a laptop (Dell Precision 
M4500) running <rs type="software">Windows 7</rs> and custom <rs type="software">LabVIEW</rs> software. The 
software controls the OPO and analyzes signals in real time to 
allow for unattended monitoring once the probe is secured. 
In this study, we attempted to isolate the effects of primary and 
tertiary blast injury while minimizing all other effects. The 
custom-made Vandenberg blast device (Fig. 2) uses nail gun 
cartridges inserted into a detachable barrel [21]. To prevent 
accidental activation, the device only fires when an operator 
simultaneously presses two switches, which requires both hands. 
A solenoid drives a metal bar to strike the firing pin against the 
cartridge (Fig. 2, bottom). In this study we used Ramset/Remington 
nail gun cartridges of .27 caliber with power level 5, which in our 
unpublished study were shown to induce moderate brain injury in 
the animal model. Under these conditions, the Vandenberg blast 
device produces a combined blast over/underpressure that is 
followed by a blunt impact caused by the venting gas jet. 
The rat model is the most commonly used model in the TBI 
research due to the similarities between TBI in humans and rats 
and knowledge obtained in numerous rat TBI studies. To 
demonstrate the feasibility of the blast-induced hematoma 
formation monitoring with this technique, the rat model was 
best because the blast-induced TBI has been studied in rats by 
many groups. Blast-induced TBI in large animals is less reproduc-
ible and practical and is not well established yet. All experimental 
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee of the UTMB. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats 
(N = 15, weight = 370-520 g) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane 
in an induction chamber, intubated and mechanically ventilated </p>

<p>with a mixture of 70:30 air:oxygen and 1.5-3% isoflurane (2-3% 
during surgery, 1.5-2% during monitoring). A tail artery was 
cannulated for continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure 
via a Biopac MP-100 system (Biopac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). The 
instantaneous blood pressure (with a sampling interval of 50 ms) 
was acquired, displayed and logged by <rs id="software-2" type="software">AcqKnowledge</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">3.9</rs> software 
running on a Macintosh PC. The current mean arterial pressure 
(MAP, averaged over the last 30 sec) was periodically calculated 
and entered in the <rs type="software">AcqKnowledge</rs> journal. Body temperature was 
monitored with a rectal probe. The dorsal surface of the head was 
shaved, and any remaining hair removed with Nair lotion, to 
minimize the attenuation of the blast wave, the laser pulses, and 
the acoustic signals during oxygenation monitoring. 
The optoacoustic probe was placed on the dorsal midline of the 
head with a layer of ultrasound gel for acoustic coupling and 
aligned for maximum SSS signal. The SSS oxygenation (SO 2_SSS ) 
was measured continuously and in real time for 10 min to 
provide a baseline. Then the optoacoustic probe was removed and 
the rat was transferred onto a 5 cm thick foam pad to minimize 
tertiary blast injuries. Using high-speed video recordings, we had 
previously confirmed that the force of the blast presses the rat into 
the foam pad. To block both debris (e.g. unburned powder) and 
heat from reaching the animal, a 1.5 mm thick silicone rubber 
pad was placed on the head over a layer of ultrasound gel (which 
conducted the blast wave). Earplugs were inserted to protect the 
eardrums. The rat was positioned under the Vandenberg device, 
with the opening of the barrel 15 mm above the protective pad and 
directly over the right hemisphere of the brain. A single blast was 
fired, the rat was returned to its original position, and optoacoustic 
monitoring was resumed as quickly as practical (typically within 
5 min). The OA probe was placed as close as possible to its pre-blast 
location, while maximizing the SSS signal. MAP monitoring was 
continued during the blast. Whenever the MAP began to drop 
rapidly, or if it fell below 60 mmHg, the OA probe was lifted, proper 
ventilation was verified, and the arterial catheter was flushed with 
saline. To maintain body temperature in the 37-38 8C range, we 
placed a warm-water blanket under the rat and a 100 W halogen 
lamp above it; the lamp was raised or lowered as needed. 
The blast injury often was followed by the formation of a 
hematoma (intracranial, extracranial, or both) over the right 
hemisphere, close to the SSS, which was revealed upon the 
completion of the experiment and animal euthanasia. Even though 
the probe was aligned over the SSS, in many cases it also picked up an 
optoacoustic signal from the hematoma. This allowed simultaneous </p>

<p>Methods-Out of 116 pregnant women 69 women had no hypertension and 47 had hypertension 
with or without proteinuria. Serum UA, creatinine and cystatin C was measured by modified 
Uricase method, modified kinetic Jaffe's reaction and particle-enhanced immunonephelometric 
assay respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the independent 
effects of serum UA, creatinine and cystatin C on maternal and fetal outcomes using <rs id="software-0" type="software">stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">13.1</rs>. </p>

<p>The data was entered in a MS-Excel database and was analysed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">13.1</rs> statistical 
software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Stata, College Station, Texas USA</rs>). We performed multivariate logistic regression 
to determine the independent effects of serum UA, serum creatinine and serum cystatin C 
before and after adjusting for the possible confounding factors on maternal and fetal 
outcomes. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, birth weight, gestational age of delivery 
and mode of delivery were treated as the dependent variables and serum UA, serum 
creatinine and serum cystatin C as independent variables. Both dependent and independent 
variables were dichotomized. Hypertension, birth weight and gestational age of delivery 
were dichotomized using the standard cut-off values. 3,17,18 The cut-offs for dichotomization 
were taken as 5.88 mg/dl for serum uric acid, 19 0.8 mg/dl for serum creatinine 16 and 1.3 
mg/L for serum cystatin c. 16 Serum uric acid ≥ 5.88 mg/dl, serum creatinine ≥ 0.8 mg/dl and 
serum cystatin C ≥ 1.3 mg/L were coded as 1 and those less than the cut-offs were coded as 
0. For each outcome the first model was unadjusted and the second model was adjusted for 
the covariates as possible confounders in the analysis. The possible confounders were age, 
BMI, gestational age, parity and birth weight in the first analysis where hypertensive 
disorders were taken as the dependent variable (Table 2); age, BMI, gestational age, parity 
and hypertensive disorders in the second analysis where birth weight was taken as the 
dependent variable (Table 3); age, BMI, parity, birth weight and hypertensive disorders in 
the third analysis where the gestational age of delivery is the outcome (Table 4); age, BMI, 
parity, birth weight, gestational age and hypertensive disorders in the fourth analysis where 
mode of delivery was taken as the dependent variable (Table 5). A p value of &lt;0.05 was 
considered as statistically significant. </p>

<p>sessment of bony fusion was conducted as previously de-
scribed [20]. Criteria were based on the standard of bone 
fusion: continuity of bony trabeculae bridging across the 
bone graft space, fusion segments not active (&lt;3 degrees) 
on a flexion-extension radiograph and no gap at interface. 
All measurements were done by one of the authors (K.C.) 
who did not participate in the surgeries. 
Baseline characteristics are presented as mean (±stan-
dard deviation) or median (interquartile range, IQR) 
for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for 
categorical variables. Independent t-test was used for the 
comparison of the mean continuous numerical data and 
Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparison of the 
medians. Categorical variable presented as percentages 
were analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact 
test when expected counts were less than five. Statistical 
analysis was performed to compare the outcomes using

The HLA-B4402/3/5 EENL crystals belonged to the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 
with unit cell dimensions (Table S1), each consistent with one molecule in the 
asymmetrical unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement 
using the <rs type="software">MOLREP</rs> program with the HLA-B*4405 as the search model 
(available from the Protein Data Bank under accession no. 1SYV0 ) ( 11 ). Sub-
sequent model building was conducted using the <rs type="software">COOT</rs> software ( 42 ), fol-
lowed by maximum-likelihood refi nement with the <rs id="software-34" type="software">REFMAC</rs> <rs corresp="#software-34" type="version-number">5</rs> program 
( 40, 43 ). Refi nement was monitored by R free , and water molecules were in-
cluded in the model if they were within hydrogen-bonding distance to chem-
ically reasonable groups, and appeared in the Fo-Fc maps contoured at 3 sigma 
and had a B factor &lt; 80 Å 2 . 
For the DM1 TCR -HLA-B*4405 EENL complex, the data were pro-
cessed and scaled using the <rs type="software">HKL2000</rs> software ( 38 ). The crystals belonged to 
the hexagonal space group P6 5 22 with unit cell dimensions (Table S1), each 
consistent with three complexes in the asymmetrical unit. The structure was 
determined by molecular replacement using the PHASER program using the 
fully refi ned unliganded DM1 TCR and the HLA-B*4405 EENL structures 
(minus peptide) as search models. Subsequent minimal model building was 
conducted using the <rs type="software">COOT</rs> software ( 42 ), followed by maximum-likelihood 
refi nement with the <rs id="software-37" type="software">REFMAC</rs> <rs corresp="#software-37" type="version-number">5</rs> program ( 40, 43 ). TLS displacement refi ne-
ment was used to model anisotropic displacements of defi ned domains. Again, 
the optimal TLS domains were determined using the TLS motion determina-
tion server ( 44, 45 ) and were read into the <rs id="software-31" type="software">REFMAC</rs> <rs corresp="#software-31" type="version-number">5</rs> program. Tight NCS 
restraints were also used during the refi nement process. 
All structures were validated using the <rs type="software">PROCHECK</rs> ( 47 ) and <rs type="software">MOL-
BROBITY</rs> ( 48 ) programs. Ramachandran plots were obtained from the 
<rs type="software">MOLPROBITY</rs> program ( 48 ). The fi nal Ramachandran statistics were as 
follows: DM1 TCR, 92.5% (most favored region) and 98.6% (allowed re-
gion); HLA-B*4402 EENL , 97.6% (most favored region) and 100% (allowed re-
gion); HLA-B*4403 EENL , 97.9% (most favored region) and 99.5% (allowed 
region); HLA-B*4405 EENL , 97.1% (most favored region) and 99.2% (allowed 
region); and DM1 TCR -HLA-B*4405 EENL , 86.3% (most favored region) and 
97.5% (allowed region). All molecular graphics representations were created 
using the <rs type="software">PyMOL</rs> system ( 49 ). </p>

<p>SPR measurement and analysis. All SPR experiments were conducted at 
25 ° C on the BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) with HBS buff er (10 
mM Hepes [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P20). The HBS 
buff er was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin to prevent nonspe-
cifi c binding. The human HLA-specifi c mAb, W6/32 ( 50 ) was coupled to re-
search grade CM5 chips with standard amine coupling. For each experiment, 
HLA-B*4402/3/5 was passed over two fl ow cells and ‫ف‬ 200 -500 response 
units (RU) was captured by the antibody. The other two fl ow cells were used 
as control cells for each experiment. The DM1 TCR was injected over all four 
fl ow cells at a rate of 20 μ l/min with a concentration range of 0.39 -400 μ M. 
The fi nal response was calculated by subtraction of the response of the antibody 
alone from that of the antibody HLA-B44 complex. The antibody surface was 
regenerated between each analyte injection with Actisep (Sterogene). All ex-
periments were conducted in duplicate. 
For cross-validation of results, the reverse experiment was performed. The 
DM1 TCR was coupled to the CM5 chip using the 12H8 antibody ( 18 ), 
which is conformation specifi c for a region bridging the ␣ and ␤ constant do-
mains of the TCR. For this experiment, 400 -600 RU of the DM1 TCR was 
captured on the antibody, and HLA-B*4405 EENL (0.6 -150 μ M) was injected 
over the fl ow cells at 20 μ l/min. The total protein levels for the HLA-B* 
4402 EENL and HLA-B*4403 EENL refolds were too low to permit these pMHCs 
to be the analytes. 
<rs id="software-43" type="software">BIAevaluation</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-43" type="version-number">version 3.1</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-43" type="creator">GE Healthcare</rs>) was used for data 
analysis; the 1:1 Langmuir binding model was used to calculate the kinetic 
constants. To allow for the capture system, the model was modifi ed to include 
an additional parameter for the drifting baseline for the TCR capture by 12H8. 
The quality of the fi t between experimental data and the binding models was 
evaluated by monitoring the 2 values (i.e., &lt; 10), as well as the residual plots. </p>

<p>Data collection, structure determination, and refi nement. The DM1 
TCR crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen using 5% glycerol as a cryopro-
tectant. The HLA-B*4402/03/05 EENL complexes were all frozen using 10% 
glycerol as the cryoprotectant. The DM1 TCR -HLA-B4405 EENL crystals 
were dehydrated in 25% PEG 3350 for 2 -5 min and fl ash frozen in liquid ni-
trogen. All data were collected on the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallog-
raphy Association Collaborative Access Team beamline at the Argonne 
Photon Source Synchrotron using the Quantum 210 CCD detector at 100 K 
(ADSC). Data for the unliganded DM1 TCR and the HLA-B4402/3/5 EENL 
binary structures were processed using either <rs type="software">MOSFLM</rs> ( 37 ) or <rs type="software">HKL2000</rs> 
( 38 ) software and were scaled using <rs type="software">SCALA</rs> software ( 39 ) from the <rs type="software">CCP4 
suite</rs> ( 40 ) or scalepack ( 38 ). 
The DM1 crystal belonged to the space group P2 1 with unit cell dimen-
sions (Table S1) consistent with two molecules in the asymmetrical unit. The 
structure was determined by molecular replacement using the <rs type="software">MOLREP</rs> pro-
gram with the 1G4 TCR as the search model (available from the Protein Data 
Bank under accession no. 2BNU ) ( 41 ). Subsequent model building was con-
ducted using the <rs type="software">COOT</rs> software ( 42 ), followed by maximum-likelihood re-
fi nement with the <rs id="software-29" type="software">REFMAC</rs> <rs corresp="#software-29" type="version-number">5</rs> program (CCP4 suite) ( 40, 43 ). Translation, 
liberation, and screw-rotation (TLS) displacement refi nement was used to 
model anisotropic displacements of defi ned domains. The optimal TLS do-
mains were determined using the TLS motion determination server ( 44, 45 ) 
and were read into the REFMAC 5 program. Refi nement was monitored by 
R free , and water molecules were included in the model if they were within hy-
drogen-bonding distance to chemically " reasonable " groups, and appeared in 
the Fo-Fc maps (where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure 
factors, respectively) contoured at 3 sigma and had a B factor &lt; 80 Å 2 . Tight 
noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were also used during the re-
fi nement process. The TCR was numbered according to the international 
ImMunoGeneTic (IMGT) unique numbering system ( 46 ), whereby the CDR1 ␣ </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using <rs type="software">JMP statistical 
software</rs>. Data are represented as mean ± SD. Two-tailed Student's t test was 
applied for comparisons of two groups and Welch's correction was applied for 
unequal variance. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey HSD 
(honestly significant difference) was applied for multiple comparisons. Sur-
vival was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. For all tests, P &lt; 0.05 
was considered significant. </p>

<p>All analysis was done using <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.1</rs>. The 
outcome variables were the dispensing cost, 
willingness to pay, and amount willing to pay for the 
community pharmacists' dispensing service. Cost 
was only analysed descriptively. The participant's 
knowledge of pharmacist dispensing was calculated 
as the percentage of the activities that the customer 
selected from the list of activities outlined in Section 
B. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were 
used to assess the factors associated with the 
participants' WTP. The Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-
Wallis, and Spearman correlation tests were used to 
assess the factors associated with the amount the 
participants' were willing to pay for the pharmacists' 
dispensing service. For all statistical tests 
performed, the significance level was set a priori at 
P&lt;0.05. </p>

<p>consideration, using <rs type="software">Medcalc</rs> software (MedCalc Software bvba, 
Ostend, Belgium) the sample size was calculated to be 125. Par-
ticipants were randomly selected from the personal list provided 
by the company. </p>

<p>Upon completion of the field survey and data collection, data 
were transferred into the computer for statistical analysis. Statis-
tical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 19</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM</rs>, Armonk, 
NY, USA). Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the 
relationship between quantitative variables such as stress, job 
satisfaction, and productivity scores. To assess the factors affecting 
productivity, linear regression analysis was applied. In all tests, the 
significance level was set at 0.05. </p>

<p>The 3D conformations of all the inhibitors were gener-
ated using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">OMEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">2.0</rs> program available from 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">OpenEye Scientific</rs> (OMEGA 2.0, OE Scientific, NM, 
USA). In this study, only the best conformer of each mole-
cule was used to generate the pharmacophore points. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">LigandScout</rs> program [25] was first employed to 
derive structure-based pharmacophore centers (Fig. 3a). The 
advanced 3D pharmacophore model option of the Ligand-
Scout program was used, which allows multiple pharma-
cophore feature types on the same heavy atom. The pharma-
cophore feature types used in this study include hydrogen 
bond donor (D), hydrogen bond acceptor (A), positively 
charged (P), negatively charged (N), and lipophilic (L) cen-
ters. Pharmacophore feature pairs are then generated by mak-
ing all possible pair-wise combinations of the above pharma-
cophore centers. A specific pharmacophore feature pair is 
determined by both the feature types involved and the dis-
tance between the two centers. For example, AL in Fig. (3a) 
indicates a hydrogen bond acceptor (A) and lipophilic (L) </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">LigandScout</rs> program[25] is used to perceive the 
pharmacophoric groups on small organic molecules (Fig. 
3b). All pair-wise combinations of the perceived pharma-
cophore centers are checked for the feature types and inter-
feature distances. In the example given in Fig. (3b), there is 
an AL pair and an AP pair, and the inter-feature distances for 
each pair are 4.6 A and 3.8 A, respectively. </p>

<p>The relationship between the molecular descriptors and 
the biological activities is modeled by the PLS (Partial Least 
Square) method [26]. Specifically, the PLS implementation 
in the <rs id="software-3" type="software">MOE</rs> package (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Chemical Computing Group</rs>, Mont-
real, Canada) was used in this study. Other types of machine 
learning methods can be used as well to analyze the dataset. </p>

<p>As described before (Cf. Method), <rs type="software">LigandScout</rs> was used 
to analyze the interactions between PDE-4 inhibitors and the </p>

<p>Data are means ± standard deviation (SD). One way analysis of 
variance and post hoc test (Dunnett) were used to identify sig-
nificant differences, unless specified otherwise, and statistical 
significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. The transport parameters (K m , 
V max , K passive ) were estimated by plotting cocaine brain or cell flux 
data against total concentration using Equation 7 and nonlinear 
regression with <rs type="software">WinNonlin</rs> software. The errors associated with 
these parameters are asymptotic standard errors returned by 
the nonlinear regression routine. </p>

<p>variables of primary clinical importance to the study was 
constructed including age group, patient role in surgical decision 
and co-morbidity (as the only measure of pre-existing disease). 
The remaining explanatory variables were considered unless the 
significant effect was only in the 'missing' category of data. 
Variables were considered in three groups and added into the 
model in order of importance to the primary aim of the study, that 
is, health measures, tumour characteristics and then socio-
demographics. Within each group the order in which variables 
were added into the model was determined by Bayesian 
Information Criterion (BIC) values of each variable added into 
the model individually. Variables with lower BIC values were 
added in sequentially starting with the variable giving the lowest 
value. At each step an individual variable's contribution to the 
model was assessed using two criteria: (1) the difference between 
the model with the additional variable and the previous model 
using the Likelihood Ratio Test (a.k.a. analysis of deviance) and 
(2) producing a significant coefficient in the model (both at a 5% 
significance level). In order to reduce the likelihood of multi-
collinearity and to ensure the number of cases in the model could 
sustain the potentially high number of health measures, they were 
only retained in the model if they produced both a significant 
coefficient and likelihood ratio test. Tumour characteristics and 
socio-demographic variables were retained if they had a significant 
likelihood ratio test only. Once each group of variables had been 
added variance inflation factors were checked and variables 
exhibiting factors above 10 removed to prevent multicollinearity 
(Kutner et al, 2004). 
In order to retain sufficient number of cases to support the 
subgroup analysis, which includes surgeons' perceptions in a 
nested model, all variables with non-significant coefficients were 
removed from the final main model. In addition one health 
measure was selected and retained as representative of the 
remaining health measures. Both the main and nested models 
were tested for goodness of fit (Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow) and 
discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve). 
Data were analysed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 12</rs>. </p>

years were more likely to have difficultly or need help with ADL 
(Po0.001) with over 50% of this age group, also having a ECOG 
performance status of 2 or more, compared with 21-37% of 
younger women (Po0.001). The proportion experiencing mild to 
moderate cognitive problems according to the <rs type="software">6CIT</rs> screening tool 
was over twice as large among women aged X85 years (30.1%) 
compared with younger age groups (p14%) (Po0.001). Body 
mass index reduced with age (Po0.001) and a greater proportion 
of those aged over 80 years were non-smokers compared with younger 
women (P ¼ 0.008). There was over a 10% increase in the proportion 
scoring 1 or more on the Charlson co-morbidity index: from 41.1% 
of 70-74-year-olds to 52.9% of X85-year-olds (P ¼ 0.016). 
All measures of health were significantly associated with receipt 
of surgery (Table 5), with poorer health decreasing the likelihood 
of undergoing surgery. Over two thirds of those not undergoing 
surgery had a co-morbidity score of 1 or more compared with 
44.0% of surgical patients. Those not receiving surgery were also 
more likely to need help with ADL (Po0.001) with 63.4% of these 
non-surgical patients having a ECOG performance status score of 2 
or more compared with 26.4% of women having surgery 
(Po0.001). Non-surgical patients also had a slightly lower body 
mass index (P ¼ 0.006) and were more likely to smoke (P ¼ 0.007). </p>

<p>Imaging 
To visualize native GFP or mRFP, we collected adult flies 4-6 days after 
eclosion and brains were dissected in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solu-
tion in PBS (1.86 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 8.41 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 175 mM NaCl) 
and fixed for an additional 60 min at room temperature. Samples were 
then washed 3 3 10 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT) 
and 2 3 10 min in PBS before mounting in Vectashield (Vector Labs). 
Imaging was performed on Leica TCS SP5 X. The resolution of the image 
stack was 1,024 3 1,024 with 0.5 mm step size and a frame average of 4. 
Images were processed in <rs id="software-2" type="software">AMIRA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">5.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Mercury Systems</rs>). The immuno-

<p>Objective Microscope (Sutter) with a Zeiss 203, 1.0 NA W-Plan-Apochromat 
objective. Emitted photons were separated from excitation light by a series 
of dichromatic mirrors and dielectric and colored glass filters and detected 
by GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu Photonics H10770PA-40 SEL). 
Photomultiplier currents were amplified (Laser Components HCA-4M-500K-
C) and passed through a custom-designed integrator circuit to maximize the 
signal-to-noise ratio. The microscope was controlled through <rs id="software-3" type="software">MPScope</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">2.0</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Nguyen et al.</rs>., <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-date">2006</rs>) via a PCI-6110 DAQ board (National Instruments). Odor 
stimuli were delivered by switching mass-flow-controlled carrier and stimulus 
streams (CMOSense Performance Line, Sensirion) via software-controlled so-
lenoid valves (The Lee Company). Flow rates at the exit port of the odor tube 
were 0.5 l/min. 
Images were converted to Analyze format and motion corrected by maxi-
mizing the pixel-by-pixel correlation between each frame and a reference 
frame. DF/F traces were calculated in ImageJ using manually drawn regions 
of interest (ROIs) for the background and brain structure of interest. Activity 
maps were generated in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> from Gaussian-smoothed, background-
subtracted images. A baseline fluorescence image was calculated as the 
average over a 10 s prestimulus interval. Minor z direction movement was 
ignored by correlating each frame to the baseline fluorescence and discarding 
it if the correlation fell below a threshold value. This threshold value was manu-
ally selected for each brain by noting the constant high correlation value when 
the brain was stationary and sudden drops in correlation when the brain 
moved. For each pixel, the difference between mean intensity during the stim-
ulus and the mean baseline fluorescence (DF) was calculated. The DF during 
the presentation of a dummy stimulus (no odor) was subtracted to control 
for mechanical artifacts from the odor delivery system. If DF was less than 
two times the SD of the intensity of that pixel during the prestimulus interval, 
that pixel was considered unresponsive. </p>

<p>Detection of intracellular ROS. Intracellular ROS production was 
evaluated by flow cytometry using the superoxide indicator hydroethidine 
(HE) 
41,58,59 and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, freshly isolated 
primary rat microglia were treated in suspension as specified in Figure 7 legend. At 
the end of the treatment, cells were incubated with 1mM HE and 10 nM Sytox 
green nucleic acid stain for 20 min at 37 1C, centrifuged at 100 Â g, resuspended 
in 100 ml of PBS containing 2% FBS and analyzed immediately using a flow 
cytometer equipped with 488 nm laser for excitation (Accuri C6, BD Biosciences, 
San Diego, CA, USA). Data were collected using FL1 for Sytox green nucleic acid 
stain (530±15 nm) or FL2 channel for HE (585±20 nm). A minimum of 10 000 
cells were analyzed per condition. For time lapse microscopy, microglia seeded in 
slide chambers were loaded with 1 mM HE and 10 nM Sytox for 20 min, washed 
and subjected to LPS (0.1 ng/ml)/ zVAD-fmk (25 mM) stimulation. Images were 
manually acquired from the same chamber field at specified time points. To 
minimize photobleaching, cells were imaged with o0.5 s of exposure time for 
each filter. Fluorescence intensity of representative cells was analyzed with

57 Using Tri reagent, total RNA was 
extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual DNA was 
digested by incubating RNA samples with DNase I for 15 min at room temperature 
followed by DNase inactivation at 65 1C for 10 min according to the manufacturer's 
instructions (Invitrogen). The samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA using the 
reverse transcription system kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as described

<p>Transmission electron microscopy. After a quick wash with PBS, 
microglia were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron 
Microscopy 225 Sciences, Hatflield, PA, USA) in 0.1 M, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer 
overnight at 4 1C. Following three washes with 8% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate 
buffer, the cells were washed again in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer 
and stained with 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 
0.5% sucrose for 1.5 h. The cells were then dehydrated in ascending 
alcohol series and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections of microglia 
were examined using an FEI Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope 
at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images were acquired with a 
MegaViewIII camera operated with <rs id="software-2" type="software">iTEM</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Olympus Soft Imaging Systems</rs>, Germany). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. All cell culture treatments were performed in at least 
triplicate samples. <rs type="software">GraphPad prism</rs> software (San Diego, CA, USA) was used for

<p>METHODS: Four patients (2 syndromic craniosynosto-
sis, 1 cranial defect, 1 distal radius deformity secondary 
to arthrogryposis) were included. CT scans (≤1 mm slices) 
were obtained (DICOM file) for volumetric conversion to 
3D models (STL file) using free open-source software (<rs id="software-4" type="software">3D 
Slicer</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">http://www.slicer.org</rs>). The resulting STL files were 
uploaded to the <rs type="software">MakerBot</rs> desktop application for printing 
with the MakerBot Replicator 2 ($2,750, MakerBot Indus-
tries, Brooklyn, NY). Material cost and printing time were 
recorded for comparison to alternative manufacturing meth-
ods. The 3D models were used to guide pre-operative plan-
ning and intra-operative reconstruction. </p>

<p>peak NRS and peak Aono's four-point scale scores. In addition, 
the exposure time to anesthetics, surgery time, time from end 
of surgery to extubation, and duration of emergence agitation 
were investigated. Patients received 25 μg fentanyl IV when their 
NRS score was found to be higher than 3; the total amount of 
fentanyl administered was recorded. When emergence agitation 
continued for more than 3 minutes, 10 mg of nalbuphine was 
administered IV. When emergence agitation continued for more 
than 1 min after drug administration, patients received 10 mg 
nalbuphine was injected IV, repeatedly. 
The patients were observed for the occurrence of compli-
cations or side effects, while being observed for nausea, 
vomiting, tremors, and hypersalivation. If a patient was experi-
enced nausea or vomiting, the patient received 0.3 mg ramo-
setron by IV; pethidine 25 mg was administered IV to patients 
if they were experiencing tremors. When respiratory failure or 
laryngospasm occurred, assisted respiration was performed, 
and endotracheal intubation was performed again if considered 
necessary. Emergence agitation was defined to be when the 
Aono's four-point scale score was 3 or higher [6]. When the 
patient was hemodynamically stable, could maintain their 
own airway, and oxygen saturation was maintained at greater 
than 95% during atmospheric respiration, the patient was 
transported to the ward, and the duration of stay in the recovery 
room was recorded. 
Data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 12.0</rs> was used in the statistical analysis. The t-test was 
used in the analysis of parametric data between the 2 groups, 
and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-parametric data. 
In the case of categorical data, the chi-square test was used, and 
the Fisher's exact test was used when necessary. Spearman's 
correlation was used to analyze the correlation between patient's 
pain and emergence agitation. Findings were con sidered to be 
statistically significant when the P value was less than 0.05. </p>

<p>vitro culture using BS-C-1 cells (African green monkey kidney 
cells; Korean Cell Line Bank, Seoul, Korea) following the man-
ufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Eagle's minimum essential me-
dium (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) with 2 mM L-gluta-
mine, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino 
acid, and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate supplemented with 3% fetal 
bovine serum (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) 
was used for maintenance of infection, and cells were incubat-
ed at 37℃ with 5% CO2. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum 
(KKU isolate) were obtained from laboratory mice (C57BL6/J) 
that were infected and maintained as described [10]. The study 
was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kon-
kuk University (Seoul, Republic of Korea). 
For DNA extraction from fecal specimens, QIAquick stool 
mini kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, California, USA) was used. 
For E. intestinalis and C. parvum DNA, each number of isolated 
spores or oocysts from 1 × 10 
4 to 1 × 10 
0 were spiked into 
500 mg of uninfected human stool and mixed with 10 ml dis-
tilled water (DW). After washing with DW twice by centrifuga-
tion at 100 g, pellets were resuspended in ASL lysis buffer includ-
ed in the kit. The samples were incubated at 70℃ for 30 min. 
The procedure was executed in accordance with the manufac-
turer's recommendations. The extracted DNA was used as a 
template for PCR. DNA of Cyclospora cayetanensis was extracted 
from the stool of an infected patient who was the subject of a 
published case study in 2003 [11]. We cloned the 18S rRNA gene 
of Cyclospora using pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, 
Wisconsin, USA) and used it as a template DNA after diluted it 
equivalent to each number of parasite. 
All of the PCR primers used in this study were designed using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Primer-BLAST</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</rs>) and are shown 
in Table 1. The first-round multiplex PCR amplification was </p>

<p>mented bands of 167 and 253 bp in E. intestinalis (Fig. 3A), 
and with BsiEI showed no fragmented bands in C. parvum (Fig. 
3B). Whereas it was confirmed with <rs id="software-2" type="software">Clone Manager</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">6</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Sci-Ed</rs>, 
North Carolina, USA) that there will be no fragmented bands 
in E. bieneusi with BsaBI digestion and 2 fragmented bands of 
48 and 137 bp in C. hominis with BsiEI digestion. Each primer 
set for microsporidia, C. cayetanensis, and Cryptosporidium used 
in the present study showed no cross-reactivity with each of the 
other parasite DNA (Fig. 4). </p>

<p>parvum target only during the first round of PCR. 
Generally the sensitivity of multiplex PCR is not exactly the 
same with individual PCR done with each parasite DNA. Multi-
plex PCR developed in the present study showed the same detec-
tion sensitivity with that of individual PCR in case of micro-
sporidia and Cryptosporidium. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the 
second-round PCR products could provide all of the detection 
results, when the multiplex PCR tests reported here were applied. 
Another advantage of the multiplex PCR test developed in 
the present study is that the 2 species of microsporidia, such as 
E. bieneusi and E. intestinalis, and the 2 species of Cryptosporidium, 
such as C. parvum and C. hominis, can be differentiated after 
PCR by restriction enzyme digestion. We did not show restric-
tion enzyme-digested PCR products of E. bieneusi and C. hominis 
in the present study as we did not secure DNAs of these 2 organ-
isms. Instead, we confirmed the results of restriction enzyme 
digestion of these 2 organisms after PCR using a restriction enzy-
me cutting software program (<rs id="software-3" type="software">Clone Manager</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">6</rs>). 
Although there is a well-established genomic database for 
Cryptosporidium (http://cryptodb.org) that was established thro-
ugh the efforts of many devoted and excellent scientists, there 
are still only limited genomic data available for Cyclospora and 
microsporidia. Therefore it is quite difficult to develop specific 
primers for these 2 protozoa. The difficulty is especially chal-
lenging for Cyclospora because PCR detection of the 18S rRNA 
gene could be confused with that of Eimeria spp., which show 
98% similarity with the 18S rRNA gene sequence of Cyclospora. 
Thus sequence analysis after multiplex PCR should be perform-
ed for the accurate differential diagnosis of Cyclospora and Eime-
ria spp. 
In conclusion, the multiplex PCR test developed in the pre-
sent study can detect microsporidia, Cyclospora, and Cryptospori-
dium, all of which cause severe waterborne diarrheal disease. 
The test is very simple and rapid and offers high sensitivity and 
specificity. This test could help improve detection of diarrheal 
outbreaks or sporadic diarrheal disease that is due to infection 
with these major waterborne protozoa which have been con-
sidered as unknown etiology for the difficulty in detection pre-
viously. </p>

<p>trode to completely ablate the entire tumor. OPN was per-
formed in a retroperitoneal approach. 
The follow-up for each patient included chest radiog-
raphy, laboratory tests, and CT. For evaluation of ther-
apeutic efficacy, the absence of enhancement inside the tu-
mor was taken to indicate technical success. A follow-up CT 
was conducted at intervals of 1, 3, and 6 months and then 
every 6 months over the years. One-month follow-up CT 
was performed to determine whether there was any rem-
nant or residual enhancement of the ablated lesion. 
Complete treatment resulted when nonenhancement was 
achieved. The technical success rate was defined as com-
plete ablation of the tumor following the initial procedure 
or additional sessions with a 1-month follow-up. Recu-
rrence was defined as growth of the tumor or any new en-
hancing portions at 3 months after confirmed nonenhance-
ment of the initial RFA lesion. Mann-Whitney U test, 
Pearson's chi-square test, and repeated-measures analy-
sis of variance between the two groups were used for analy-
sis of the characteristics of each group. A p-value ＜0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses 
were performed by using IBM <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM Co.</rs>.,

prepared in buffer A [25-mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5-mM 
MgCl 2 , 150-mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5-mM PMSF, 5-mM 
␤-mercaptoethanol and one tablet of Protease Inhibitor 
Cocktail/50 ml (Roche)]. After three washes with 500-l 
W-200 buffer [50-mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200-mM KCl, 5-
mM EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 0.1% NP-40], the beads were trans-
ferred to a 1-ml column and washed seven times with W-
200, 1 ml each time. Bound proteins were eluted with 200 
l of 50-M ASO116847 in W-100 by incubation at room 
temperature for 30 min with gentle rotation. The eluted 
ASO-protein complexes were precipitated and analyzed by 
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Alterna-
tively, to identify binding proteins that can bind ASO/RNA 
duplex, the eluted ASO-protein complexes were diluted 
with 200-l W-100 supplemented with 100 units of RNase-
OUT (Life Technologies) and further incubated at 4 
• C for 
2 h with 40-l Neutravidin beads pre-incubated with 40 
l of 200-M biotinylated oligonucleotides complementary 
(XL180) or non-complementary (XL181) to ASO116847. 
After washing seven times with W-200 supplemented with 
20-unit/ml RNaseOUT, the beads were treated with 100-l 
Tris-EDTA buffer containing 5-units/l RNase I at 30 
• C 
for 30 min, and the eluted proteins were precipitated and 
separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE. Sliver staining was car-
ried out using ProteoSilver Plus Silver Stain Kit (Sigma) 
based on manufacturer's instructions. The interesting pro-
tein bands were excised and identified by mass spectrom-
etry by Alphalyse Inc. Briefly, the samples were reduced 
and alkylated with iodoacetamide, followed by trypsin di-
gestion. The digested peptides were concentrated and ana-
lyzed on a Bruker Autoflex Speed MALDI TOF/TOF in-
strument. MALDI MS/MS was conducted on 15 peptides 
for peptide fragmentation analysis. The MS and MS/MS 
spectra were combined and used to search database with the 
<rs type="software">Mascot</rs> software. Alternatively, the isolated proteins were 
analyzed by western blot. </p>

<p>We reviewed the records of the patients who underwent 
a pars plana vitrectomy for idiopathic ERM between January 
2004 and February 2008. All of the subjects had a complete 
ocular examination to exclude possible peripheral retinal 
breaks or other anomalies which could result in ERM for-
mation. Exclusion criteria included a history of ocular or 
systemic conditions known to be associated with macular 
ERM formation, potentially irreversible significant loss of 
vision, less than seven months of follow-up, and clinical or 
angiographic evidence of a vascular occlusion or other ano-
maly involving the macula. Thirty eyes from 30 subjects were 
included in this study. The patients underwent a standard 
three port pars plana vitrectomy assisted with triamcinolone 
and membrane peeling. The procedures were performed by 
a single surgeon and used high-magnification viewing and 
intraocular forceps. Because the ERM was peeled without 
identification of the internal limiting membrane (ILM), the 
ILM was unintentionally peeled off together with the ERM 
in some patients. Concomitant cataract surgery was performed 
if necessary. Preoperative and postoperative examinations, 
performed at every follow-up visit, included the best-corrected 
visual acuity using a standard Korean visual acuity chart 
(Han's chart). The examinations also included a slit-lamp 
examination, fundus examination, fundus photography, and 
OCT. Patients followed-up every one or two months until 
they showed no further changes in visual acuity. After they 
were stable, they were followed every three to six months 
according to their postoperative status. 
Optical coherence tomography was performed using com-
mercially available equipment (software 3.0; Carl Zeiss Me-
ditec, Dublin, CA, USA). After papillary dilation, measure-
ments of the average thickness of the central 1 mm of the 
retina before and after surgery were compared. All of the 
subjects were divided into two groups according to the con-
comitant cataract surgery. Eighteen eyes underwent a vitrec-
tomy with concomitant cataract surgery; 12 eyes underwent 
a vitrectomy alone. The visual acuity and foveal thickness 
was measured for each group, and statistical analyses were 
carried out. 
The statistical analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 12.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA</rs>). All of the comparisons 
were two-tailed. Means of the two groups were compared us-</p>

<p>However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of 
miR-26a in AML cells. 
17 Thus, we decided to investigate 
novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between 
the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 trans-
cription factor (data from <rs id="software-0" type="software">TargetScan</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">www.targetscan.org</rs>) 
and Pictar (pictar.mdc-berlin.de)), an important regulator 
of the G 1 /S-phase transition. 
23 The 3'-untranslated region 
(3 
0 -UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative 
binding sites for miR-26a (Figure 1a). To show the direct 
targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase 
reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3 
0 -UTR of E2F7 (WT), 
the E2F7 3 
0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), 
the E2F7 3 
0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) 
or the E2F7 3 
0 -UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites 
(Mut1-2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected 
in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control </p>

<p>cells were resuspended in PBS/50% FCS, fixed in 70% ethanol for 24 h, incubated 
with 50 Ag/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 U/ml DNase-free RNase A 
(Sigma-Aldrich), and analyzed after 3 h (10 000 events) using an Epics XL 
Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Morphology was evaluated after 
7 days from lentiviral transduction in conventional light-field microscopy of 
Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospins. Differentiation was assessed by direct immuno-
fluorescence staining of cells using an allophycocyanin anti-human CD11b (Becton 
Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA), PerCP anti-human CD14 (Becton Dickinson) 
and PE-IgG1 isotype control (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as described 
previously.

<p>Abstract 
Introduction: One of the biggest disadvantages of dental amalgam is that gaining its ultimate strength is a slow 
process. The use of a rapid-setting amalgam with high early compressive strength could be a better option in 
preventing early fractures in pediatric dentistry. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of diode laser 
irradiation on compressive strength of dental amalgam. 
Methods: A case-control study was performed on 180 amalgam samples made at the Tehran Dental Material 
Research Center in 2014. Fifteen and thirty minute compressive strength of regular setting and fast setting 
amalgams were measured as control. In case groups, the samples were irradiated by 810nm diode laser with 
power of 1 and 2 watt and in pulsed and continuous mode, and compressive strength was measured after 15 and 
30 minutes. Statistical analysis was performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18</rs> using one and two way ANOVA and Scheffe 
multiple comparisons test and p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. 
Results: Numerous kinds of laser irradiation led to a significant increase in compressive strength compared to 
regular setting control groups. Fifteen minutes-compressive strength of regular-setting amalgam irradiated by 2 
watt laser was significantly more than fast-setting control group (p&lt;0.05). 
Conclusion: Irradiation by 810nm diode laser can significantly increase the compressive strength of dental 
amalgam especially in the first 15 minutes.

<p>HRQOL. This questionnaire had been translated 
to Persian and validated for Iranian population. 
The internal consistency (to test reliability) 
showed that all eight SF-36 scales met the mini-
mum reliability standard, the Cronbach's alpha 
coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.90 with the 
exception of the vitality scale (alpha = 0.65) (18). 
Inclusion criteria were amputation of lower limbs 
veterans based on observation. Veterans were ex-
cluded, as were severely mentally handicapped and 
subjects unable to understand Persian language. 
The soft ware of <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs><rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18</rs> was used for performing 
the data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used 
to analyze data. </p>

<p>location of the arm node, the crossover rate of the arm node, 
and the metastatic rate of the arm node were collected from 
all patients. All analyses were done in SPSS for Windows ver-
sion 17.0 (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, USA). The effect of arm node 
preserving surgery on lymphedema was analyzed by paired 
t-test (in a comparison between arm circumference changes 
at the last follow-up point of the ipsilateral upper-extremity 
and contralateral upper-extremity circumference in each group) 
and by an independent t-test (in a comparison between arm 
circumference in the ipsilateral upper-extremity of the arm 
node preserved group and unpreserved group). A p-value 
&lt; 0.05 was considered significant. </p>

<p>Analyses were carried out using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.2</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC). </p>

<p>-test was 
used for comparing proportions. Iron status indicators, 
such as sTfR and SF, were transformed to logarithms 
before performing statistical analyses. The results in the 
tables are shown using the original units without any log

As already performed by Ortega et al. (Ortega et al., 2010), 
all the analyses conducted on the HELENA data were 
adjusted by a weighing factor to balance the sample 
according to the age and sex distribution of the theoretical 
sample to guarantee representation of each of the stratified 
groups. The counts of subjects (n) are reported in the tables 
as unweighted values. All the statistical analyses were 
performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> statistical software package for 
Microsoft Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 12.00</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). </p>

<p>The data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 5.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Cochrane Collaboration</rs>, The Nordic Cochrane 
Centre, Copenhagen, 2014) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">Comprehensive Meta-Analysis</rs>

antiretroviral was considered in a separate analysis of the 
association between adherence and virologic failure in random-
ized clinical trials. Results are presented based on 9 categories, 
including study region, antiretroviral regimen, treatment experi-
ence, virologic failure cut-off points, adherence cut-off points, 
adherence measurement, study design, observation period, and 
year of publication. Adherence pooled odds ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals were calculated using a random effect 
model (DerSimonian and Lard)

dom variation within studies and between-studies. </p>

<p>Total RNA extracted from Huh-7 cells was reverse transcribed 
into cDNA using the RT2 First-Strand Kit (SA Biosciences, 
Germany). The cDNA was then combined with RT2 SYBR 
Green qPCR Master Mix (SA Biosciences) and equal aliquots 
of this mixture were added to 96-well plates of the Human 
Apoptosis RT2 Profiler PCR Array (SA Biosciences) that con-
tained the gene-specific primers, human ATGs PAHS012z 
(SA Biosciences). PCR was performed using the 7500 Fast 
Real-Time PCR System (ABI) with the following thermal 
cycling conditions: 15 min at 95 
8 C for 1 cycle, 10s at 95 
8 C, 
and 1 min at 60 
8 C for 40 cycles. Expression of 84 key genes 
involved in apoptosis and 5 housekeeping genes (B2M, ACTB, 
GAPDH, HPRT1 and RPLPO) was profiled. Threshold cycle 
data obtained was analyzed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">RT2 Profiler</rs> Software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 3.5</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SA Biosciences</rs>). Relative gene expression was 
calculated using the 2 
−DDCT method. </p>

<p>All data are presented as mean with standard error of the 
mean (SEM). <rs type="software">GraphPad Prism 5.0</rs> was used to prepare all 
figures. Statistical significance of the data was analyzed using 
unpaired Student's t-test, and determined at a p value of 
&lt;0.05 (*p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001). </p>

<p>Mice-Fibrillin-1-deficient mice and NeuroD-deficient mice 
were bred and maintained as described (1, 10). We used the 
NeuroD-deficient mice maintained in 129/SvJ background (11, 
12). Progeny from heterozygote matings were used for the 
described studies. These mice were housed in a facility accred-
ited by the American Association of Laboratory Animal Care, 
and the animal studies were reviewed and approved by the 
institutional animal care and use committee of The Johns Hop-
kins School of Medicine. 
Expression Profiling Analysis-Lungs from fibrillin-1-defi-
cient mice and littermate controls at postnatal day 1 (PD1) and 
postnatal day 5 (PD5) were harvested and quickly frozen. Lungs 
from two groups of mice (wild-type and fibrillin-1-deficient) at 
each time point were pooled in groups of two or three. Total 
RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). 
Expression profiling was done with Affymetrix A734 Gene-
Chips (48 chips for this study), containing ϳ7000 full-length 
genes and ϳ1000 expressed sequence tags. Biotinylated cRNAs 
prepared from total RNAs were hybridized to U34A GeneChips 
in duplicate. Fluorescent signals were measured with a Hewlett 
Packard G2500A Gene Array Scanner. Data were analyzed with 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Affymetrix suite</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.0</rs>, corrected for saturation, and evaluated 
with <rs id="software-1" type="software">GeneSpring</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5.0</rs> software. The primary gene expression 
data can be found on the World Wide Web at the NCBI GEO 
data base (GDS242). 
Morphology and Histology-Three to five mice of each geno-
type were studied at the noted ages. For histologic and morpho-
metric analyses, mouse lungs were inflated at 25 cm of H 2 O and 
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in low melt agarose. The lungs 
were equilibrated in cold 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, sec-
tioned, and then embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were cut at 
5 m and either stained with hematoxylin and eosin or pro-
cessed for immunohistochemistry. </p>

(1:500; Dako), and active caspase-3 (1:25; Abcam). 
Neuroendocrine Cell Quantitation-For details of the proto-
col, refer to Ref. 14. To characterize NE differentiation in fibril-
lin-deficient mice and wild-type littermates, we counted the 
total number of synaptophysin, CGRP, and PGP9.5 immunore-
active solitary PNECs and NEBs (neuroendocrine foci) in form-
aldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung sections. This was cor-
related to the number of airways in the same sections (foci/ 
airway). To determine the size of NEBs in these same mice, 
pictures of each NEB were acquired using <rs id="software-2" type="software">MetaMorph</rs> soft-
ware (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Universal Imaging/Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, 
PA). The immunoreactive area was manually outlined and 
measured using the same software, and the size in m 
2 for each 
individual NEB was tabulated. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using the Mann-Whitney test (<rs type="software">SigmaStat</rs>). 
For differential measurement of solitary PNECs versus NEBs, 
lung tissue sections were co-stained with PGP9.5 (Dako) and 
DAPI (Molecular Probes) as described under "Immunohisto-
chemistry." The total number of airway cells was determined by 
counting cells per 20ϫ field staining positive for DAPI in the 
airway. Neuroendocrine cells were quantified based on the total 
number of cells staining positive for PGP9.5. Those cells posi-
tive for PGP9.5 were characterized as either components of 
NEBs (cluster of Ն3 neuroendocrine cells) or solitary neuroen-
docrine cells based on morphology. These two neuroendocrine 
cell types were then quantified and normalized to airway base-
ment membrane length in m ϫ 10 
4 . 
Cell Culture and Transfection-The MLE12 cell line, an 
immortalized mouse lung epithelial cell line that maintains </p>

<p>characteristics of type II alveolar 
epithelial cells (15), was a kind gift 
from Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett (Univer-
sity of Cincinnati) and was main-
tained in Dulbecco's minimal essen-
tial medium/F-12 medium (1:1) 
supplemented with 2% fetal calf 
serum. Subconfluent cells were 
transfected with Lipofectamine Plus 
(Invitrogen) according to the manu-
facturer's protocol and harvested 
after 24 or 48 h. All transfections 
were performed in triplicate. The 
Myc-tagged murine NeuroD cDNA 
construct was a gift from Drs. David 
Turner (University of Michigan) 
and Jacqueline Lee (University of 
Colorado). 
For conditioned media experi-
ments, medium was removed from 
transiently transfected cells after 24 h 
and replaced with serum-free 
medium. Supernatants were har-
vested after 24 and 48 h, and cells 
were removed by low speed centrifu-
gation. After washing with phos-
phate-buffered saline, serum-starved 
MLE12 cells were treated with super-
natants from transfected cells. For proliferation assays, cells were 
incubated for the designated time periods after treatment or trans-
fection and then assayed per protocol with the Promega CellTitre 
96 nonradioactive proliferation assay. 
Data Analysis-Absolute analysis of <rs type="software">Affymetrix</rs> image data 
were done using <rs id="software-5" type="software">Affymetrix Microarray Suite</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">4.0</rs>. Values of 
intensity differences as well as ratios of each probe pair are used 
for determination of whether a transcript is called "present" or 
"absent." The differentially expressed gene lists for each time 
point were generated using <rs id="software-6" type="software">GeneSpring</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Silicon Genetics, CA</rs>). In <rs type="software">GeneSpring</rs>, those genes showing at least four 
<rs type="software">Affymetrix</rs> present calls were selected prior to further data 
processing. Welch's t test was performed to calculate the prob-
abilities of significant gene expression changes. Since the probe 
sets were tested multiple times, we used a highly stringent p 
value cut-off (p Ͻ 0.001) to reduce the number of false positives 
to less than 1 in 1000. 
Statistical Analysis-Analysis of variance and Student's 
t-tests were used to determine differences between groups. In 
the morphometric study, statistical differences were deter-
mined by the unpaired Student's t test for comparison of septal 
measurements. Values for all measurements were expressed as 
means Ϯ S.E., and p values for significance were designated at 
Ͻ0.05. </p>

<p>In the early platform literature, the platform was seen as a base architecture for product 
development with standard components that could be built upon (Cusumano and Suarez 
2009). More recent research, especially on today's complex ICT industries, has argued that 
a platform is not solely a technology, but also the outcome of a set of business behaviors 
and relationships between actors in an ecosystem. This ecosystem for modern high-
technology platforms is characterized as having high levels of interdependence between 
actors, as well as high potential for innovation by each actor (Gawer and Cusumano 2002; 
Gawer and Henderson 2007; Gawer 2009). As a result, even those firms with clear market 
dominance in one area-e.g., Nokia with handsets-are dependent on the innovation of 
complementary firms to maintain their leadership position. Hardware firms and software 
firms rely on each other to push technology forward. Even Apple and its relatively closed 
<rs type="software">iOS</rs> depends upon thousands of application developers to continue to create desirable apps 
for end-users; those developers that create iPhone apps have bet on the iOS platform's 
success and must rely on Apple to maintain and update their access to its operating system 
for ongoing development. In this system the interdependence is not limited to the 
transactional, supply-chain flow of typical goods and services, but is also based on the 
strategic exchange and integration of innovation among primary firms and their 
complementors to advance the platform (Tee and Gawer 2009). 
The platform owner usually has intellectual property rights to use as leverage over those 
building applications upon the platform. Depending upon the robustness of rights, this 
means that the platform owner may be able to appropriate some of the value created by the 
applications built by platform users-indeed, the platform owner may depend on such 
value-creation by complements. The platform owner may also use its power asymmetry to 
stimulate competition among complementary firms providing the same service, which can 
lower its costs and further fortify its position (Tee and Gawer 2009). </p>

<p>dominates the industry in terms of handset sales, and has been the primary supporter of the 
correspondingly dominant <rs type="software">Symbian</rs> operating system. However, Nokia is quickly losing 
smartphone market share to new competitors, especially Apple and Google, and the current 
state of the market (see Table 2) can be seen as a battle between an entrenched global 
incumbent and newcomers to the mobile space. 
The key firms with competing smartphone operating systems are Nokia (Symbian/Meego 
and now Windows Phone 7 or WP7), Apple (iOS), Google (Android), Research In Motion 
(Blackberry), 
4 Palm/HP (WebOS), and Microsoft (WP7). While Nokia, RIM, Apple, and </p>

<p>Relying on its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities and strong relationships with 
network carriers around the world, Nokia rode the wave of mobile phone adoption to 
become the dominant mobile handset producer. However, despite strong sales of lower-end 
handsets in developing countries, its share of the global market has steadily declined from a 
peak of approximately 60% of all handsets to 30% in 2010. By the end of 2007, Symbian 
was the OS for approximately 65% of all smartphones, compared to 12% for <rs type="software">Windows</rs> and 
6.5% for the iPhone. Nokia alone held about 53% of the global smartphone market (West 
and O'Mahony 2008). By the end of 2010, however, only 37% of all smartphones were 
running Symbian, compared to 26% for Android and 17% for iOS (Gartner 2010). 
As the dominant manufacturer, Nokia was entirely aware of the coming convergence 
of the Internet and the mobile phone. Its response was to join in 1998 the three-largest </p>

<p>handset makers at the time, Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola, and the English firm Psion, 
to create a new company that would develop a smartphone-specific operating system-
Symbian-that they would freely license to a wide range of handset makers (West and 
Mace 2010). Nokia's strategy was to create a common standard that would eliminate 
platform competition and help ensure that its dominance was not threatened through a 
standards change it was not involved in. Because Nokia made its profits by selling 
handsets and base stations, it sought to neutralize potential threats to value capture by 
supporting an open-source standard. Once it began backing Symbian, Nokia immediately 
accounted for more than 80% of Symbian's handset sales and the majority of all 
smartphone sales until 2008; currently Nokia captures approximately 31% of the 
smartphone handset market (Nokia Q4 2010). In June 2008, Nokia bought control of 
Symbian and began distributing its operating system as open source software, before 
announcing in 2010 that the most advanced Nokia smartphones would no longer run 
Symbian, but instead a new OS called <rs type="software">Meego</rs>, but in early 2011 abandoning this for WP7. 
Meego was a collaboration between Nokia and Intel, merging <rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Nokia</rs>'s <rs id="software-4" type="software">Maemo</rs> and <rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Intel</rs>'s 
<rs id="software-5" type="software">Moblin</rs> projects into a single, open-source effort. Based on Linux and managed in part by 
the Linux Foundation, Meego was slated to be the most open of all the current 
smartphone operating systems. 
Given its dominance in the Symbian ecosystem and its position as the global leader in 
smartphone sales, Nokia's decision to phase out development of the Symbian OS was a 
major turning point. By leaving behind a legacy operating system in favor of new 
technology and then dropping that initiative, Nokia hoped to catch up with its competitors' 
much younger operating systems. Microsoft has done the same by dropping Windows 
Mobile and starting over with WP7. Nokia's choice to adopt WP7 is recognition, as Teece 
et al. (1997) observed that complementary assets can be extremely important during 
technological transitions. Nokia, as the global cell phone leader has significant 
complementary assets including powerful connections to operators, extremely efficient 
supply chain management including their own global manufacturing facilities (see 
Rouvinen in this volume), and enormous reservoirs of wireless knowledge to leverage 
this risky transition. The question is whether the smartphone transition will allow the 
utilization of these complementary assets. 
It was from the two nations where Nokia failed to have meaningful participation from 
where its most significant manufacturing competitors would come. As has been described 
by Funk (2001; 2003), while Nokia did not have a meaningful presence in Japan, for a 
number of reasons Japanese firms, though often introducing the newest applications, were 
never successful in exporting (Kushida and Zysman 2009). In contrast, two Korean firms, 
Samsung and LG, eagerly licensed new technologies such as Qualcomm's CDMA 
technology and deliberately followed a low-cost mass production strategy that defeated 
most of Nokia's important Western mobile phone competitors. Nokia, however, was able to 
counter this strategy by selling high-end phones in Europe, in particular, but also in 
developing nations, while also developing a low-cost production capacity in developing 
nations, thereby meeting the Korean competition directly. 
The other threat that materialized was the one that was less obvious. This was from the 
U.S., but more particularly, Apple Computer and the iPhone, which seamlessly integrated 
the Internet into a mobile phone. Nokia recognized both the design excellence of the iPhone 
software, which may have been imitable, but it was the plethora of third-party application 
providers and media content owners connected through a single marketplace-iTunes-that 
created a dynamic software-based supplier ecosystem which Nokia had never before 
experienced. This blind spot to changes in the U.S. market may have been, in part, due to </p>

<p>The <rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Palm</rs> WebOS offering for smart phones is an outgrowth of its strength in PDAs. 
However, in the transition to smart phones it had to update its operating system, hence the

concerns about its survival, crippling adoption of both the new platform and its phones. The </p>

<p>3-T MRIs (0.6-mm isotropic voxels; 3D double-echo steady-
state [DESS]; Siemens Trio) were acquired to generate 
3-dimensional (3D) bone and meniscal models and to con-
firm bead placement and identify meniscal root insertions. 
Cartilage was manually segmented on MRI 3D DESS 
sequences and models were created using <rs id="software-4" type="software">Mimics Software</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Materialise</rs>). 
28 Computed tomography (CT) images (0.6-
mm slices; GE LightSpeed 16) were obtained to identify </p>

<p>DSX data were transferred to custom computerized soft-
ware, and radiographic images were corrected for distor-
tion and intensity gradient. As previously described, the 
positions of the implanted bone and meniscal beads were 
tracked and reconstructed into the 3D laboratory coordi-
nate system in custom software with 0.1-mm precision 
(Figure 3). 
4,5,26 The CT scans were segmented and recon-
structed into 3D specimen-specific femur and tibia models, 
and anatomic coordinate systems were manually estab-
lished. 
25 Knee kinematics (femoral and tibial bone positions) 
was determined by 3D locations of bone beads. Meniscal 
kinematics and deformation were determined by evaluating 
movement of meniscal beads relative to the tibia using cus-
tom <rs id="software-7" type="software">MATLAB software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-7" type="creator">MathWorks Inc</rs>). 
An ellipse, using the least-squares method, was mathe-
matically fit to the 6 meniscal beads and the meniscal root 
insertions for each meniscus, which were identified on MRI 
as described (Figure 4). The overall meniscal translation 
was characterized by the movement of the center of the 
ellipse and was compared between the ACL-intact and 
ACL-deficient states. The change in arc length between 
beads was used to measure circumferential meniscal defor-
mation in the anterior, middle, and posterior regions in the 
2 states. Radial deformation was measured between the 
center of the ellipse and the bead locations in these same 
regions. Finally, we measured vertical deformation, or 
meniscal compression, by the vertical movement of the 
beads relative to the underlying tibia, which was converted 
to a percentage relative to the unloaded knee. Each knee 
was compared with its unloaded static state. 
MRI bone and cartilage models as well as CT bone mod-
els were coregistered with DSX data, and the overlap of the 
cartilage models was evaluated using a previously </p>

contact location, mean strain, and mean area of both the 
ACL-intact and ACL-deficient states (Figure 5).

<p>Abstract. Inhibins are members of the TGFβ superfamily and act as suppressors of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
secretion from pituitary glands via a negative feedback mechanism to regulate folliculogenesis. In this study, the INHBB gene 
was knocked down by three RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ-ZsGreen vector-mediated recombinant plasmids to explore the 
effects of INHBB silencing on granulosa cell (GC) cell cycle, apoptosis and steroid production in vitro. Quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, flow cytometry and ELISA were performed to evaluate the role of INHBB in the mouse 
GC cell cycle, apoptosis and steroid production in vitro. The results showed that the relative mRNA and protein expression of 
INHBB in mouse GCs can be significantly reduced by RNAi with pshRNA-B1, pshRNA-B2 and pshRNA-B3 plasmids, with 
pshRNA-B3 having the best knockdown efficiency. Downregulation of the expression of INHBB significantly arrests cells 
in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and increases the apoptosis rate in GCs. This was further confirmed by downregulation of 
the protein expressions of Cyclin D1, Cyclin E and Bcl2, while the protein expression of Bax was upregulated. In addition, 
specific downregulation of INHBB markedly decreased the concentration of estradiol and progesterone, which was further 
validated by the decrease in the mRNA levels of CYP19A1and CYP11A1. These findings suggest that inhibin βB is important 
in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle progression in granulosa cells. Furthermore, the inhibin βB subunit has a role in the 
regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis. Evidence is accumulating to support the concept that inhibin βB is physiologically 
essential for early folliculogenesis in the mouse. 
GCs transfected with different RNAi vectors were harvested at 48

overnight at 4 C, washed again in PBS and stained using propidium

2 First Standard kit 
(SABiosciences). The RT 
2 Profiler array was probed according to 
the manufacturer's protocol, using the Profiler PCR Array System 
and SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR master mix (SABiosciences) 
in an ABI 7500 Fast sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystems). 
Gene expression was compared with the web-based software 
package for the PCR Array System (http://www.superarray.com/ 
pcr/arrayanalysis.php), which automatically performs all ΔΔCt 
based fold-change calculations from the specific uploaded raw 
threshold cycle data. 
Statistical analysis. The data presented are shown as means 
± SD of three or five independent experiments. Statistical sig-
nificance was estimated by Student's t test for unpaired observa-
tions and one-or two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni's, 
Tukey's, or Dunnett's post-hoc comparisons. Differences were 
considered significant at when p values were &lt; 0.05. All statistical 
analyses were conducted using <rs id="software-1" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">GraphPad Software</rs>). For immunoblots, a linear correlation was observed 
between increasing amounts of input protein and signal intensity. </p>

(HD) is one of the chronic diseases with effects on patient's qual-
ity of life. Patients undergoing hemodialysis must adhere to a very 
restricted diet and fluid intake. These patients require four hours 
of dialysis sessions three times a week at dialysis unit. These 
results in a loss of time that affects employment, leisure and social 
relationships (Ikonomou et al., 2015). Patients undergoing HD 
experience multiple problems such as sodium and water retention 
(Lee, 2012), hyperphosphatemia (Karamanidou, Clatworthy, 
Weinman, &amp; Horne, 2008), hyperkalemia (Bellizzi et al., 2016), 
hypertension, anemia (Erlingmark, Hedström, &amp; Lindberg, 2016), 
fatigue (Zyga et al., 2015) heart disease (Segall, Nistor, &amp; Covic, 
2014) or diabetes mellitus (van der Meer, Ruggenenti, &amp; 
Remuzzi, 2010). The management of such health issues involves 
several variations in the patient's lifestyle. The success of treat-
ment depends largely on patient adherence to stringent recom-
mended regimen. Non-adherence to therapeutic recommendations 
can have untoward effects on quality of life (Ibrahim, Hossam, &amp; 
Belal 2015), increased morbidity, healthcare costs and mortality. 
Overall, it is estimated that approximately 50% of patients on dial-
ysis are poorly compliant with their treatment (Kammerer, Garry, 
Hartigan, Carter, &amp; Erlich, 2007). </p>

<p>Content Validity Index (CVI) was used to assess the relevance 
of each question using a 4-point scale: 4=highly relevant, 3=rele-
vant with minor adjustments, 2=minimally relevant and 1=not rel-
evant. For the construct validity of the questionnaire the technique 
of factor analysis with the rotation method of axes was applied 
(Equamax by normalizing by Kaiser). Repeatability was evaluated 
by the method McNemar-Bowker. Internal consistency of the 
questionnaire was calculated through Cronbach's a coefficient 
while the significance level was set up at 5%. Quantitative vari-
ables are described as mean (± Standard Deviation) and qualitative 
variables as absolute frequencies and relative frequencies. The sta-
tistical analysis was performed using IBM <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> Statistics <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version20</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2003</rs>, Chicago, USA). </p>

<p>Chi-square analysis was used to compare sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristics, unadjusted risks of adverse events, and mortality within 
30 days between patients who received initial CTC and OC. Unadjusted 
risks of adverse events were included as these data have not been previously 
reported using claims data. Given the cohort study design a generalized linear 
regression with a logit link and binomial distribution was used to estimate the 
odds ratios (OR) of adverse events between patients undergoing CTC and OC by 
indication (i.e. symptomatic versus asymptomatic) controlling for differences in 
patient characteristics including gender, age, race, comorbidities associated with 
studied adverse events, and adverse events in the preceding 90 days. Due to 
low event rates for the targeted adverse events there is limited concern of 
overestimation of the risk ratio, which is approximated by the OR in cohort 
studies. Statistical significance was declared for results with a two-sided p-value 
of b 0.05. We used <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 11</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">STATA Corp</rs>) for all statistical analyses. </p>

<p>The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) captures the antidisciplinary ethos 
of the MIT Media Lab. Like the Lab, it opens new connections between 
science and design, encouraging discourse that breaks down the barriers 
between traditional academic disciplines. It explores not only the design 
of science, but also the science of design. 
With this innovative approach, JoDS intends to incite much-needed 
change in academic publishing by challenging traditional academic silos 
as well as the established publishing practices associated with them. 
The journal is hosted on an open-access, open-review, rapid 
publication platform called <rs type="software">PubPub</rs>, created by students at the Media 
Lab. <rs type="software">PubPub</rs> is a collaborative publication environment with rich 
commenting features, and powerful, intuitive authoring tools. JoDS 
articles are authored directly within the <rs type="software">PubPub</rs> environment, which 
provides support for multimedia, image integration, and large data sets. 
Unlike journals that operate within a formal peer review system and 
rigid disciplinary framework, JoDS invites jargon-free communication 
across all fields of design and science, unconventional formats, and 
widespread community participation. JoDS empowers authors to engage 
in fruitful, ongoing discussion about their work with members of many 
different communities, both within and outside of their home disciplines. 
This rich, peer-to-peer approach to review provides for a much broader 
array of perspectives, new pathways forward, and emergent topics for 
further research. 
JoDS is shepherded by a team led by MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito, 
and published in partnership with the MIT Press. All JoDS articles are

<p>cellular context. Our binding data simply suggest that the 
5 
0 -SS sequences bear some characteristics of a functional 
ESE, as predicted by <rs type="software">ESEfinder</rs>. Moreover, we find 
that binding affinity does not agree with predictions of 
the <rs type="software">ESEfinder</rs> scoring system that were developed based 
upon ESEs identified by functional SELEX method 
(Figure 1B and C). This suggests that SRSF1:ESE-
binding affinity and splicing efficiency are not necessarily 
correlated. </p>

<p>The economic benefit of a U-healthcare system must become 
clear if the system is to be widely accepted. In other words, it 
must be shown that the medical and social cost reductions 
achieved are greater than the expenses associated with estab-
lishment, application, and maintenance of the system. Such 
costs include commercialization, provision of new devices, 
the labor of medical teams, systems maintenance, and server 
management. Any measure enhancing patient care and satis-
faction, while minimizing personal expense, must be cost-ef-
fective [42]. Artificial intelligence systems minimizing the 
medical manpower necessary for effective patient manage-
ment are required. Such software would maximally reduce so-
cial and medical expenses. In fact, such a program (System for 
Automatic Verification, or <rs type="software">SAVE</rs>) was recently applied in </p>

<p>clinical research, and reduced physician labor by 50%, thus af-
fording efficiency, stability, and economic benefit. <rs type="software">SAVE</rs> will 
contribute to commercialization of U-healthcare systems by 
reducing labor costs [43]. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
We performed all analyses with JMP <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.10</rs> software (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA). At the patient 
level, we described patient demographics, the primary 
indication for intubation, initial method of intubation, 
success rates and adverse event rates as proportions with 
95% CIs and medians with IQRs. Then, at the ED level, 
we described medians, IQR and ranges for each 
outcome for all trauma patients. We also repeated the 
analysis after stratifying by indication (non-cardiac arrest 
vs cardiac arrest) and specialty (emergency physicians vs 
non-emergency physicians). All p values were two-tailed, 
with p&lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>The model described above is calibrated to match the Spanish economy as closely 
as possible. We will shortly explain the calibration targets (Table 1), while leaving a 
more detailed description of the calibration procedures for ''Appendix 2''. Several 
parameters are taken from Burriel et al. (2010), who perform a full blown Bayesian 
estimation of their model with data from the Spanish economy. 
We assume the average lifetime of bankers to be equal to 24 quarters, resulting in 
a survival rate h of 0.9583. The maturity structure parameter q is calibrated to reflect 
the weighted average maturity of government bonds in Spain between 1998 and 
2008, which is 6.1 years according to the OECD Stats database. The annual fixed 
real payment on long-term government bonds is set to 4.1 %, which is the 
1998-2008 average of the interest rate on Spanish government bonds with a 
maturity of 10 years found in the <rs type="software">Statistical Data Warehouse</rs> of the European Cen-
tral Bank (2014). 
The ratio of investment, government consumption and government debt over 
GDP are derived from <rs type="software">Eurostat</rs> (2014). The 15-year average percentage of GDP that 
can be ascribed to private investment and government consumption is taken 
between 1994 and 2008. This results in steady state ratios of 22.6 % for investments 
over GDP and 17.8 % for government consumption over GDP. For the steady state 
credit spread C, the difference between the loans to non-financial corporations 
(''Total'') and the deposit rate on ''Household deposits redeemable at notice, Total, 
New Business'' for the period between 2003 and 2007 is taken. Loan rates are not 
available before 2003. We end the sample at the end of 2007 to exclude data from 
the Great Recession. For the 2003-2007 period we arrive at an average annual credit 
spread in Spain of 188 basis points (annually), which amounts to a steady state 
quarterly spread of 47 basis points. We calibrate the diversion parameter for 
government bonds k </p>

<p>Statistical analyses 
For statistical analysis, <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 14.0</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, USA) was used to discriminate the 
signifi cance using one-way ANOVA analysis independent 
samples, t-test mean comparison on the voiced and 
voiceless according to the places of articulation, types 
of phonation, and the places of articulation in the inter-
vocalic VCV combinations. To verify the identity of the 
variance of the two groups, it was statistically analyzed by 
f value. Th e quantitative evaluation of the VOT category 
was done based on the previous research methods which 
used the comparison of mean diff erence. </p>

<p>simplicity and functionality so seamlesly. Their market share increases 
constantly and web sites get optimised for the small display sizes (often 
referred to as "responsive webdesign") otherwise the usability lacks. 
Students seem to like smartphones aswell and a good question is if 
and to what extend those devices can play a role in e-learning. 
"<rs type="software">Mediman</rs>", an adaptation of the common game Hangman has been 
developed for smartphones. Test users asked to complete an online 
questionnaire. 
So far, only few e-learning applications for smartphones seem to exist. 
This is reflected in the low usage frequency. Especially the fact that 
most of the test users wear a smartphone with them all the time makes 
it an ideal learning plattform. Short learning sessions were rated more 
important than continuous text. 
The majority of the 11 test users rated <rs type="software">Mediman</rs> as well developed. 
The foremost question whether a smartphone e-learning application is 
feasible must be answered positive -acceptance in the test user group 
was shown. E-learning applications on smartphones will be an important 
topic in the future as market shares increase constantly. Further studies 
are required due to the small number of partitipants in our survey. </p>

<p>Hangman [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galgenm%C3% 
A4nnchen] is a classical game for two or more players in 
which one player thinks of a word and the other tries to 
guess it by suggesting letters. The game is over if the 
player needs more guesses than allowed. The idea of this 
game has been adapted within the project "<rs type="software">Mediman</rs>" 
so that medical terms must be guessed. At the end of 
each game the term is defined and explained to produce 
a benfit for the student (see figure 2). </p>

<p>Before starting the actual development of the application 
a decision regarding the programming language had to 
be reached. The author decided to program a native HTML 
website in combination with the JavaScript framework 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">jQuery mobile</rs> [<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">http://jquerymobile.com</rs>/] as it can be 
used to build native looking applications on one hand but 
also supports many mobile devices out of the box [http:// 
jquerymobile.com/]. This ensures a quick development 
and reduces errors on the different devices. <rs type="software">jQuery mobile</rs> </p>

<p>is widely spread, possible alternatives with similar fea-
tures are <rs type="software">jQTouch</rs> and <rs type="software">Sencha Touch</rs>. 
<rs type="software">Mediman</rs> uses a MySQL database to store the data and 
AJAX ("Asynchronus JavaScript and XML") to increase 
usability, e.g. no page reload is necessary to start a new 
game round as data is loaded in the background. 
During the development simulation programs where used 
that emulate the smartphones on the development PC. 
The benefit is that the developer does not actually has 
to own all the devices to run tests with them. 
To start the application the user needs to type in the in-
ternet adress (URL) -no installation is required. If the 
website is additionally added to the home screen a 
defined icon appears and the difference between a native 
application and a web site simulating it vanishes even 
more (see figure 1 and figure 2). 
Subsequent to the development process a questionnaire 
with nine items was desigend. If not declared otherwise 
a Likert scalling was used. Test users (n=20) were asked 
to submit the online forms between June and Juliy 2012 
after they received an invitation via e-mail. All test users 
are students (third year or above) attending Faculty of 
Medicine of the University of Munich and took part volun-
tarily. The data analysis was performed with <rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> 
<rs id="software-8" type="software">Excel</rs>. </p>

<p>Smartphones are widely spread devices with plenty of 
possible applications due to their connection to the inter-
net. The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Stanford 
for example picked up this trend and equip every new 
medical student with an Apple iPad since 2010 [6]. Par-
allel to the introduction the faculty established a portal 
with learning material (presentations, videos, manuals 
and more) which can be accessed by the students for 
free using a app [7]. This allows the students to access 
the needed material when they want and how often they 
want. 
So far, available e-learning programs, e.g. <rs type="software">CASUS</rs>, work 
within a desktop environment -and they do their job 
mostly fine. Those programs are therefore designed and 
optimised for desktop computers (with internet browsers), 
big screens and a computer mouse for interaction. The 
e-learning programs can be used with modern smart-
phones aswell but they are always suboptimal with re-
spect to usability and legibility. The growing role smart-
phones play in our daily life due to their increasing market 
share demands an adaptation to the changed needs of 
the users. The analysis of the questionnaire showes that 
the test users think that smartphones are an ideal 
learning environment because most of them carry one 
with them all the time. This is comprehensible as for the 
first time ever more smartphones than desktop computers 
have been sold last year [http://www.canalys.com/ 
newsroom/smart-phones-overtake-client-pcs-2011]. The 
survey showed aswell that not enough learning applica-
tions specially designed for smartphones exist (see figure 
2), the desire for them though is high (see table 2). 
In our opinion the results however do not allow the con-
clusion that existing learning applications should simply 
be optimised for the smaller display sizes. The demands 
of the users seem to be more differentiated as they seem 
to look for short sessions explicitly. A test user submited 
the free text item covering the needs of the users with 
the comment that he or she would like to start sessions 
while travelling betwen two university locations or even 
when sitting in the train. Short texts and optimised cases 
for the repetition of knowledge seem the be more import-
ant than continuous text. 
Applications -generally speaking -can be produced as 
native applications for a chosen manufacturer or operat-
ing system (e.g. Apple iOS, Android) and can then advert-
ised and sold through the manufacturer's online store. 
The manufacturers support the developers by providing 
developmental environments and content (SDK). Apple, 
for example, will check each version before deploying it 
to the online store and can even refuse to publish it. </p>

<p>Mediman uses a different way. Instead of developing the 
application for the various operating systems individually 
the author used programming languages that are normally 
used to program websites (HTML, CSS, Javascript) in 
combination with a JavaScript framework called <rs type="software">jQuery 
mobile</rs>. This framework simulates a native application 
optically and because the necessary skills already existed 
no further longsome familiarisation with SDKs was neces-
sary. This ensured a short development time, the list of 
supported devices of the framework is long and checks 
by the manufacturers prior to the aproval of an application 
to their online store does not exist. As a sort of hybrid 
technique <rs id="software-11" type="software">Phonegap</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-11" type="url">http://phonegap.com</rs>) must be 
mentioned (web sites will be transformed and compiled 
into native apps) but was not chosen for the development 
of <rs type="software">Mediman</rs> as it would have required training. Offering 
applications through the online stores means automatic 
avertising but web applications allow faster publication 
due to no certivication process. 
The results of the survey show that learning applications 
designed as a web site with an ideal integration into the 
smartphone -simulating a native application -seems 
to work for the test users. The users liked the adaptation 
of the game Hangman into a medical learning program. 
The used JavaScript framework ensured fast developing 
and publishing. We did not find any relevant limitations 
using web site programming languages as no device 
specific function, e.g. motion sensor, was used. Those 
functions can normally only be used if the SDK is used. 
Uncertainty exists insofar as the analysis of the submited 
data of the test users did not show a clear trend if an 
active internet connection may be a requirement for 
running the learning application (see table 2). The anxiety 
that this is explicitly a problem of the used programming 
languages used in the example project Mediman can be 
qualified as version 5 of HTML supports storing data 
locally [http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html]. Apart 
from the technical aspect the author thinks that mobile 
plans with unlimited traffic are common. 
The importance of smartphones increases in learning 
environments. Today, only few learning applications de-
signed to work seamlessly on smartphones exist -this 
is reflected in the usage frequency. It does not seem to 
be the one and only solution to adapt existing e-learning 
programs to fit into the small screen sizes because the 
needs of users is different. The survey showed that 
dealing with learning applications for smartphones will 
be an important topic in the future. 
<rs type="software">Mediman</rs>, the example project that was used mainly to 
demonstrate the potential and feasibility of the realisation 
of a small and simple learning application for smart-
phones was rated well within the questionnaire. As this 
was one of the main aims the project succeeded in our 
opinion and further devlopments should be considered. 
Due to the small number of participants we should not 
draw a general conclusion out of the given data but as a 
high relevance can be derived further research on this 
topic must be seeked. </p>

6,8,22 . Secondary

The panel of phosphorylation profiles of kinases were analyzed following manu-
facter recomendations (Human Phospho-Kinase Array, ARY003, R&amp;D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN). Membranes were incubated with 500 mg of protein extract from 
skin and tumor samples. This array screens for relative levels of phosphorylation of 39 
proteins. Quantification of the relative expression of specific phosphorylated protein 
was determined by <rs id="software-8" type="software">QuantityOne</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">BioRad</rs>). </p>

<p>Pollen assessments and statistical analysis 
At flowering time, a small amount of pollen was collect-
ed from six anthers of each bud, mixed, and then stained 
with 1% (w/v) acetocarmine solution. Lengths of short axes 
of pollen grains (100-400) were microscopically measured 
using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Image-Pro PLUS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Media Cybernetics Co., Ltd.</rs>., 
Bethesda, MD, USA). In the control and N 2 O-treated plants 
of 'Yelloween', microspore tetrad sizes were measured from 
young anthers of 30-35 mm floral buds. Pollen fertility was 
determined using the acetocarmine method, whereby 
acetocarmine-stained pollen was regarded as fertile pollen. 
Before pollination, the germinability of the pollen obtained 
by N 2 O treatment was assessed after culture for 24 h at 25°C 
in agar medium containing 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.7% (w/v) 
agar, 0.3 g/L calcium nitrate and 10 mg/L boric acid. 
For data analysis, a non-parametric multiple comparison 
method (Steel-Dwass test) was performed using <rs type="software">Microsoft 
Excel 2003</rs> and statistical add-in software (<rs id="software-1" type="software">Excel Toukei 
2010</rs> for Windows, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Social Survey Research Information Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan</rs>). </p>

<p>The GEO database (41 ), a central repository for 
differential gene expression data, was used in this 
study. This database offers an extensive collection 
of gene expression data on cancer and compares vari-
ous types and subgroups. We selected only those gene 
expression studies where a tumor tissue was compared 
against a healthy tissue reference. The initial datasets 
were derived for six cancer types including blad-
der (GSE7476), colon (GSE4107), kidney (GSE7023), 
thyroid (GSE3678), breast (GSE6883) and prostate 
(GSE3325) cancers. To maintain consistency, data 
for all cancer types in this study were collected from 
experiments that used only Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 
2.0 GeneChip. This is a newer chip from Affymetrix 
that covers about 54,000 human genes, but the trade-
off is that this restriction limits the number of avail-
able datasets on a specific tumor grade for a specific 
cancer. Since the goal of our study is to carry out 
comparison of baseline PPIs in different cancer types, 
it requires robust datasets for each cancer type. To 
obtain datasets of reasonable size, we didn't take the 
tumor grade into account; hence heterogeneity some-
what exists in the grade of the tumor tissue sam-
ples used in this study. In brief, bladder, kidney 
and prostate datasets were obtained from low, high 
or metastatic (invasive) tumors, whereas breast, colon 
and thyroid samples originated mostly from low grade 
or early onset tumors. Under this GeneChip, breast 
cancer and prostate cancer were found to have only 34 
and 139 differentially expressed genes, respectively; 
hence these two cancer types were eliminated from 
further analysis. More details on the grade and tu-
mor type used for each cancer are provided in Table 
S1 (see Supporting Online Material). 
Datasets in each series were analyzed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">Gene-

quantitative measure of how similar a pair of proteins 
are, based on the annotations (GO terms) in a given

effective in interpreting the functional similarities of 
genes based on gene annotation information from het-
erogeneous data sources (42 , 43 ). In our study, the 
semantic similarity between the molecular functions 
or the biological processes of two proteins involved 
in a PPI was calculated following the literature (43 ) 
and only those PPIs with a high semantic similarity 
value of 4.0 or more (5.5 being the highest) were used 
to create interaction networks under each GO term 
category. </p>

<p>For the estimation and simulation, I do a Bayesian estimation. I execute the 
Bayesian estimation in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Dynare</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 4.2.2</rs>. Readers who are interested in the 
details of the estimation are referred to Griffoli's (2007-2008) Dynare User Guide. </p>

<p>One thing that I should note here is that this version of <rs type="software">Dynare</rs> does not allow the 
higher-order approximation of the model for the estimation. However, it is well 
known that log linearization is good enough if the main focus of the research is 
not on welfare analysis or investigation of the financial market but on examining 
the business cycle.

Knowledge, attitude and practice of devitalizing agents: A survey of 
general dental practitioners. J Int Oral Health 2015;7(8):86-88. 
Abstract: 
Background: This study aimed to analyze knowledge, attitude 
and practice of general dental practitioners regarding the use of 
devitalizing agents in their respective practice. 
Materials and Methods: A total of 100 practicing general dentists 
were randomly chosen as per the list of practitioners available to 
local state association. The questionnaire was designed to cover 
general information of the participating dentist and concerning 
different aspects of devitalizing agents. The collected data was 
subjected to statistical analysis using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS (Statistical Package for 
Social Sciences</rs>) <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 17.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM Statistics</rs>, Chicago, Illinois, 
USA). Descriptive statistics was drawn with respective percentages 
to have a comparative overview. 
Results: The response rate was 97%, of which the effective and 
complete replies received were 77% (75). 56% respondents 
used paraformaldehyde containing pastes. Majority of general 
practitioners (61%) did not observe any post-operative 
complication following the use of devitalising agent. 33% (25) of 
the respondents were not aware of the complications of devitalizing 
agents. 
Conclusion: Thus, it can be concluded that general dental 
practitioners in Pune and Nashik district of Maharashtra, India do </p>

• no falls during hospitalization; 
• hospitalization in the same care unit of the respective case; 
• pairing by gender. 
Exclusion criteria for controls was: 
• discharge before case fall. 
The computerized system <rs type="software">GIPSE</rs> (Management Informa-
tion First Aid and Emergency) has been used for detection 
of controls, it is a technical tool for the computerization of 
Emergency Services, and disclosures discharge required 
by SIES (Emergency Medical Information System). 
The search criteria considered to determine the controls 
have been the department, the event date fall (admis-
sions have been considered starting from the four days 
before case fall) and gender. Medical folders have been 
identified by SDO codes that stemmed entering this in-
formation into <rs type="software">GIPSE</rs> program. </p>

<p>Each folder has been analyzed independently by two re-
viewers using the data extracting form preformed. Medi-
cal records evaluations were compared and any disagree-
ment has been resolved with the help of a third reviewer. 
Finally, data collected by extraction form have been in-
serted in an <rs type="software">Excel</rs> file. 
In the statistical analysis, possible associations between 
patient falls and variables have been evaluated using 
Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Student's t, Mann-
Whitney and odds ratio (OR), with confidence intervals 
(CI) at 95%. The level of significance for all analyzes 
has been setted at p &lt; 0.05. 
A conditional logistic regression was used to investigate 
the relationship between the outcome of being a case 
or a control and the set of prognostic factors (intrinsic 
and estrinsic). Parameters were estimated using condi-
tional method for matched data [21]. The model fitted 
only included covariates resulted significant at univari-
ate analysis. The likelihood-ratio test has been applied 
to evaluate the goodness of model. Data were analyzed

<p>cancer (all types). Cox regression models were con-
ducted to estimate the crude and multivariable adjusted 
relative risk by calculating HRs and 95% CIs of cancer 
in relation to drug exposure (ever vs never exposed). 
Potential confounding factors in the relation between 
cancer and CCB exposure were accounted for in multi-
variable regression models and included: age at index 
date and sex (matching variables in the comparison with 
the non-CCB cohort), smoking status, body mass index 
(BMI), alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension, 
arrhythmia, angina, or heart failure, as well as the use of 
statins or aspirin. These factors were chosen based on 
previous findings linking the variables with an increased 
risk of cancer. For the AHT cohort, separate analyses 
were performed for colon cancer, breast cancer in 
women and prostate cancer in men. Additional analyses 
were also conducted using the AHT cohort to account 
for switching drug exposure, with models stratified 
according to the duration of cumulative exposure to 
drugs (0-5, 5-10 and &gt;10 years). All analyses were con-
ducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.9.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute, Inc</rs>,

<p>Logs noted dilation progression, which included pain and 
anxiety with dilation, time to achieve intercourse, setbacks, and 
untoward effects. Post-treatment FSFI scores were compared 
with preprocedure scores. The lead author (Dr Pacik) personally 
entered all data prospectively into an extensive <rs id="software-0" type="software">Excel</rs> spreadsheet 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft</rs>, Redmond, WA, USA). This included re-evaluation 
of data at the time of consultation, treatment, and post-

<p>An iterative analysis, drawing primarily on constant com-
parative methodology, was used. This involved moving 
back and forth between interview transcripts to support the 
evolution of the process by identifying emerging themes and 
defining the relationships between them. 
16-19 The validity and 
the accuracy/reliability of the early codes were established 
by each member of the experienced qualitative team (ALK, 
MSM, KMF, and KBF) analyzing the initial four transcripts, 
coming to consensus, thus defining the initial codebook. 
Emergent codes were added throughout the analysis. The 
remaining interviews were divided among the team and 
coded using <rs id="software-0" type="software">ATLAS.ti</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH</rs>). The consistency of coding/interpreta-
tion was checked at biweekly meetings where discrepancies 
were addressed through consensus. Triangulation of the 
qualitative findings, observations, and the RCT quantita-
tive findings were integrated and documented with an audit 
trail.

tribution of continuous variables was investigated 
with the Shapiro-Wilk test in order to check whe-
ther the distribution was normal. Descriptive sta-
tistics were used as the mean and standard deviation 
for continuous variables. The statistical difference 
between the suprascapular notch measurements 
in both sexes were examined using the Mann-Whit-
ney test. A p level of &lt; 0.05 was accepted as sta-
tistically significant. </p>

<p>In conclusion, using <rs id="software-3" type="software">MultiScanBase</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">v.14.02</rs> soft-
ware for measurements and typing suprascapular

sification of SSN variations, and also, for the first 
time, present their distribution in female and male 
scapulas. 
Although distribution of the suprascapular notch 
types in both sexes was similar, the maximal notch 
depth and middle and superior diameters of SSN 
were significantly higher in males than in females.

<p>(München, Germany) using default settings. PCR bands 
were quantified with the <rs id="software-0" type="software">FusionCapt Advance</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Vilber Lourmat</rs>, Eberhardzell, Germany). The mean and 
standard deviation of replicated experiments were deter-
mined to obtain statistically reliable results. 
The degree of contamination suppression was deter-
mined by quantifying the visible product of the second 
PCR. Complete contamination suppression was assumed 
when the second amplification yielded no visible PCR prod-

<p>used as a template. The length of K1 mismatches in the 
mismatch settings was 4-5 base pairs (Supplementary Table 
S2). As shown in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S4 
the matched settings led to the production of the expected 
PCR products. On the other hand the K1 mismatch settings 
between first and second amplification primers completely 
suppressed the amplification during the second PCR. 
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of contamina-
tion protection by a highly sensitive NGS we investigated 
the 9 primer sets in 9 match settings and in 9 assays with 
matching sets plus spike-in contaminations (Supplementary 
Table S3). For these experiments an artificial template was 
used (Supplementary Figure S3). 
In total, 18 NGS libraries were prepared, which were 
tagged by standard Illumina barcodes. The libraries were 
sequenced on <rs type="software">Illumina</rs> MiSeq and demultiplexed by Illu-
mina software (default parameters). For 8.52 % of the reads 
the barcode could not be identified unambiguously. These 
reads were excluded from further analysis. Another qual-
ity filtering step was imposed by our read-joining algorithm 
which requires that both reads of each read pair exhibit sig-
nificant overlaps. 94.8% ± 1.81% of all read pairs could by 
joined successfully to one consensus sequence. Finally, the 
joined reads were classified and filtered again for occurrence 
of possible k1/k1 -boxes, which was the case for 90.6% ± 
2.4%. In the end, compared to the original raw read num-
bers, on average 83.5% ± 2.2% of reads were used for the 
data analysis, which was equivalent to around 8.5 million 
read pairs. 
Our observations are summarized in the following and in

Predator Avoidance Behavior. Three different treatments were 
applied: 1) control; without any predator; 2) prey alongside with a free 
roaming predator, and 3) when prey was placed in water which contains 
residual predator's kairomones but without the actual predators. 
Kairomones was defined by Nourdland and Lewis (1976) as a sub-
stance that is released, acquired, or produced by organism which, when 
it comes into contact with another species in natural context. This sub-
stance will evoke the behavioral and physiological reactions of the 
receiver but not the emitter. In this study, the emitter refers to Tx. splen-
dens larva, and the receivers are Aedes and Anopheles mosquito larvae. 
For residual kairomones preparation, a predator was released in 500 ml 
seasoned water and fed with 10 mosquito larvae for 24 h prior to the 
start of the treatment. Feeding is crucial to simulate the kairomones 
release by injured prey (Dodson et al. 1994, Kats and Dill 1998, Kusch 
et al. 2004) and production of remnants exists from predation event 
(Kesavaraju and Juliano 2004). After 24 h, the predator and the remain-
ing prey were discarded using a pipette. We then proceeded to use the 
residual kairomone water (for treatment 3). 
For treatment 2, mosquito larva prey was placed in a plastic con-
tainer filled with 500 ml seasoned water. Seasoned water is tap water 
that has been left standing 24 h to reduce the chlorine content. After 
approximately 10-mins period of acclimation time, a Tx. splendens 
predator was added into the same container. The behaviors and posi-
tions of prey were recorded for 30 min or until it was captured. We cate-
gorized the behavior into four types of activity based on Juliano and 
Reminger (1992): 1) resting-larva neither feeding nor moving; 2) 
browsing-larva propelled along the surface of the container by the 
movements of their mouthparts; 3) filtering-larva floating in the water 
column propelled by the movements of their mouthparts; and 4) thrash-
ing-vigorous lateral movements of the larval body, propelling them-
selves through the water. Four positions were also categorized as; 1) 
surface-spiracular siphon of the larva in contact of the water-air inter-
face; 2) bottom-larva within 1 mm of the bottom of the container; 3) 
wall-larva within 1 mm from any surface of the container walls; and 
4) middle-larva more than 1 mm from any surface of the container 
and not in contact with the water surface. All experiments were con-
ducted in laboratory conditions with temperature of 26 6 1 
C and 
65-85% humidity. All treatments were replicated six times. 
The behavioral data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regres-
sion in <rs id="software-0" type="software">IBM SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">20.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2012</rs>). We recode the behavior categories from 1 
to 4 for activities and 5 to 8 for positions as follows: 1) resting; 2) brows-
ing; 3) filtering; 4) thrashing; 5) surface; 6) bottom; 7) wall; and 8) mid-
dle, which were then modeled as being dependent on prey species (Ae. 
aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and An. sinensis) and treatments (control, free-
roaming predator, and residual kairomones remnant). </p>

<p>There are currently two validated indexes available for 
assessing the disease location and severity of small bowel 
CD with CE (Table 4). The Lewis score evaluates three small 
bowel segments for the parameters villous appearance, ulcers 
and stenosis [61]. The Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease 
Activity Index. (CECDAI) evaluates the proximal and distal 
small bowel for the parameters inflammatory lesions, disease 
extension and stenosis [62]. A software application for 
calculation of the Lewis score has been incorporated into the 
<rs type="software">RAPID Reader</rs> platform for Pillcam SB. The following cutoffs 
have been proposed: &lt;135, normal small bowel or clinically 
insignificant inflammation; 135-79, mild disease activity; and 
&gt;790, moderate to severe disease [61]. The CECDAI is simpler 
to calculate, but cutoffs for endoscopic remission and different 
disease severities have not been properly established. However, 
there is a good correlation between the two indexes (r=0.63, 
P&lt;0.0001), and in a retrospective and unblinded single reader </p>

<p>A significant limitation with CE is the time-consuming video 
analysis. In previous series, reading times above 40-50 min 
were reported [77]; thus, ways to reduce reading times without 
affecting the diagnostic accuracy would be helpful in clinical 
practice. For CD in particular, increasing the viewing speed 
may be feasible, because this disease is characterized by 
multiple lesions that are most often widespread in the small 
bowel. 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Given Imaging</rs>'s <rs id="software-1" type="software">RAPID Reader</rs> enables alterations of the 
viewing mode from single to dual or quad view, and the frame 
rate can be adjusted from 5 to 40 frames per second (fr/sec). 
Günther et al compared single view at a speed of 10 fr/sec 
with quad view at 20 fr/sec [78]. The mean reading time was 
reduced from 22 down to 12 min, and detection rates of 
angioectasias, erosions, ulcers, and polyps were significantly 
lower with quad view. However, in patients with suspected or 
known CD, overlooked lesions did not change the result of the 
examination. Recently, Nakamura et al compared single view, 
dual view and quad view at different frame rates, using a small 
bowel video sequence with 60 pathological images of small 
bowel angioectasias [79]. Increasing the frame rate from 10 to 
15, 25 and 40 fr/sec resulted in a 33%, 60%, and 72% reduction 
in playing time, respectively, but at the expense of a drop in 
the number of lesions detected. Altering the viewing mode had 
no effect on the reading time for any given frame rate, but the 
detection rate was significantly higher with dual and quad view 
compared to single view. The authors conclude that the optimal 
combination for a high detection rate is 10 fr/sec using dual or 
quad view. 
Another way to decrease reading times is by reducing the 
number of images presented to the capsule endoscopist. The 
quick view function provided by <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Given Imaging</rs>'s <rs id="software-2" type="software">RAPID 
Reader</rs> filters the number of images shown. With a sampling rate 
of 10% (default setting), 10% of images from the original videos 
is shown. Images are filtered according to a specific algorithm 
developed by the manufacturer, and sampling rates between 2% 
and 80% can be chosen. Shiotani et al examined how different 
sampling rates affect the detection rates of quick view CE [80]. 
A variety of preselected lesions were included in the study. With 
sampling rates of 5%, 15%, 25% and 35%, 61%, 74%, 93% and 
98% of lesions were detected. With a 25% sampling rate, only 
7% of lesions were missed, and the reading time was reduced by 
approximately 50%. This setting was considered a proper trade-</p>

Alexa-488-, Alexa-Fluor-594-, or Alexa-Fluor-647-conjugated cor-
responding secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch 
were used for indirect fluorescence. Images were taken using a Zeiss 
LSM510 confocal microscope. A <rs type="software">Cell Counter</rs> software plugin in 
the <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> program was used to count cells. Data were obtained 
from 12 random sections from three to five mice in each group. </p>

<p>cells in the striatum were identified under visual guidance using 
IR-DIC optics and tdTomato fluorescence. Whole-cell current-
clamp and voltage-clamp recordings were performed using glass 
pipettes ($6-9 MU) filled with intracellular solution (0.2 mM 
EGTA, 130 mM K-gluconate, 6 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 10 mM 
HEPES, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.4 mM GTP-Na, and 14 mM phosphocre-
atine-Tris at pH 7.2 and 285 mOsm). Intracellular solution was 
supplemented with 0.5% biocytin (B4261; Sigma) for biocytin 
labeling. All recordings were obtained with a MultiClamp 700B 
amplifier. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz, acquired, and digitized 
at 10 kHz using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Clampex</rs><rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">10.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>). APs were 
recorded in current clamp mode and elicited by a series of current 
injections starting from À160 pA with 20-, 40-, 80-, or 160-pA in-
crements and 800 ms duration. Sodium and potassium currents 
were recorded in voltage-clamp mode in response to a series of 
voltage steps ranging from À60 mV to +60 mV at 10-mV incre-
ments and 100 ms duration. Delayed rectifier potassium currents 
(K d ) were measured 50 ms prior to the end of current step. 
Spontaneous synaptic currents were recorded in voltage-clamp 
mode. In all voltage-clamp recordings, cells were clamped 
at À60 mV or À80 mV, whichever is close to the resting mem-
brane potential of the cell except during the voltage-step proto-
col. In all current-clamp recordings, recordings were made at 
the resting membrane potential or without any current injection. 
Series and input resistance were measured in voltage-clamp mode 
with a 400 ms, À10 mV step from a À60 mV holding potential 
(filtered by 10 kHz, sampled at 50 kHz). Cells were accepted 
only if the series resistance was less than 30 MU and stable 
throughout the experiment. Data analysis was performed in

<p>All the analysis was performed in the <rs id="software-0" type="software">MATLAB</rs> 
environment (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">The MathWorks</rs>, Natick, MA) using <rs id="software-1" type="software">OMLAB</rs> 
software (OMtools, downloadable from <rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.om lab.org</rs>). Eye position was sampled directly; it was pre-
filtered using a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 
Hz to reduce the noise while minimally affecting the 
foveation periods. The 20-Hz value is five times the 
maximum frequency present in foveation periods (0-2 Hz) 
and still allows separation of foveating and braking saccades 
from those periods. Analysis was always done on the 
fixating eye. Segments with inattention or blinking were 
discarded. </p>

<p>We analyzed the data using the eXpanded Nystagmus 
Acuity Function (NAFX) [21]. It is an extension of the 
previous Nystagmus Acuity Function (NAF) that consists of 
a mathematical function containing the following waveform 
parameters: foveation-period duration, standard deviations of 
main foveation periods and velocities, and number of cycles 
in a fixation interval. In the <rs id="software-2" type="software">OMtools</rs> software, we use the 
NAFX's graphical user interface for data selection and 
analysis (details can be obtained from <rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://www.omlab.org/ OMLAB_page/Teaching/Using_NAFX.html</rs>) [22]. The 
NAFX provides an objective and repeatable measure of 
nystagmus foveation quality that accurately predicts the best-
corrected visual acuity possible for subjects without afferent 
visual system defects, regardless of the eye-movement 
recording system, the nystagmus type, and waveforms [21]. 
In the absence of afferent deficits, the NAFX is highly 
correlated with measured acuity. We averaged the NAFX 
values if several were obtained at each gaze angle. </p>

<p>Hf source = 0, which corresponds to the 
maximum elemental fractionation possible for the reservoir that the 
zircons crystallized from. Although this represents extreme Lu/Hf

crystallization of an LMO and production of zircon in the last residual 
melt (urKREEP). A <rs type="software">pMELTS</rs> simulation (31) with the <rs type="software">alphaMELTS</rs>

sion 1 isotopic composition models for both species (www.earth-time. 
org). Data culling was done in this same program using the decreasing 
203/205 and the increasing 206/204 ratios over the course of an analysis. 
Depending on the sample intensities, U was measured in either static 
mode on Faraday cups on 10 </p>

<p>Pb ages by several million 
years. However, this is not a significant source of uncertainty in the Hf 
model ages and therefore do not affect our age-of-moon analysis. We 
also note that uranium blanks could have a significant effect on the con-
cordance of very low U grains. However, a sensitivity test performed by 
varying the U blanks from 0.009 to 0.09 pg shows that the U blank 
composition is not important for the concordant and radiogenic grains 
that are included in the age-of-moon analysis (table S1A). 
All data reduction, error propagation, and U-Pb data plotting were 
done using the <rs type="software">U-Pb_Redux</rs> software package (48). All reported uncer-
tainties were 2s and included only internal sources of uncertainty 
(counting statistics, uncertainties in correcting for mass discrimination, 
and the uncertainty in common Pb composition). Forty procedural 
blanks spiked with the same tracers and run within a period of 3 years 
(21 of which in the course of this study) showed an amount of common 
Pb (Pbc = 0.2 to 13.9 pg; average, 3.6 pg) that agreed well with that found 
in zircon analyses; therefore, all common Pb was assumed to be derived 
from procedural blanks. The composition of the 40 spiked blanks is as 
follows: </p>

<p>apparently lower than the solar system initial (Figs. 3 and 4), but note 
that its great uncertainty, due to the small size of the grain, overlaps 
allowed solar system values. This zircon was not included in the average 
model age of 4.51 Gy. Data are presented in table S3A. 
pMELTS modeling. 
It has been suggested that the Apollo zircons crystallized from KREEP. 
We performed <rs type="software">pMELTS</rs> simulations (31) using the <rs type="software">alphaMELTS</rs> 
interface (32) to model the crystallization of KREEP and the evolution 
of the Lu/Hf ratio to the last residual melt present in the KREEP reser-
voir. We assumed closed system crystallization under isobaric condition 
(5 kbar was chosen for our runs), regulated by the QFM-5 (iron-wustite) 
and QFM-4 oxygen fugacity buffer. We used a starting liquid equivalent 
to the KREEP whole-rock composition reported by Warren (54) and 
the KREEP Lu and Hf abundances reported by Neal and Kramer 
(55). We used the modal phases predicted by <rs type="software">pMELTS</rs> together with 
partition coefficients from the earthref.org database to model the evo-
lution of </p>

<p>Sequences of ENC homologs were retrieved from the Ensembl 
genome database and National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) Protein database, by performing BlastP 
searches (Altschul et al. 1997) using human ENC1 as query. 
An optimal multiple alignment of the retrieved ENC amino 
acid sequences including the query sequence was constructed 
(fig. 1B) using the alignment editor XCED in which the <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> 
program is implemented (Katoh et al. 2005). Similarly, a 
second alignment including human, zebrafish, Drosophila </p>

<p>melanogaster, Ciona intestinalis, and C. savignyi amino acid 
sequences belonging to the KLHL superfamily was con-
structed (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material 
online; for a list of sequences used in this study, see supple-
mentary table S1, Supplementary Material online). 
Sea lamprey P. marinus ENC-A was predicted in 
the AUGUSTUS web server (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/webaugustus/prediction/create</rs>, last accessed July 24, 2013) 
with its species-specific parameters on the supercontig22564 
in the version 3 assembly of the genome sequencing project 
(PMAR3.0). An ORF of the gene designated P. marinus ENC-A 
was curated (for sequence see supplementary table S2, 
Supplementary Material online). A truncated fragment of 
this gene is also present in Ensembl release 64 
(ENSPMAG00000008371). The second lamprey ENC gene 
(ENC-B) 
is 
available 
in 
Ensembl 
version 
64 
(ENSPMAG00000000574). Because of unresolved orthology 
of these lamprey ENC genes to gnathostome ENC1-3, we 
refer to them as PmENC-A and PmENC-B. 
To search for ENC orthologs in sequenced invertebrate 
genomes, we explored public databases. Predicted peptide 
sequences of Nematostella vectensis, Trichoplax adherens, 
Helobdella robusta, Capitella teleta, Lottia gigantea, Daphnia 
pulex, Branchiostoma floridae (all accessible at the DOE 
Joint Genome Institute: http://www.jgi.doe.gov/, last accessed 
July 24, 2013) and of Schistosoma mansoni (ftp://ftp.sanger. 
ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Schistosoma/mansoni/genome/gene_ 
predictions/, last accessed July 24, 2013) were downloaded, 
and local Blast searches using human ENC1 protein as query 
were performed. Invertebrate sequences with high similarity 
scores were included in the phylogenetic analysis (fig. 2). </p>

<p>In phylogenetic analyses, we employed <rs id="software-2" type="software">PhyML</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">3.0</rs> (Guindon 
et al. 2010) for maximum-likelihood (ML) tree inference and 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">MrBayes</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">3.1</rs> (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001) for Bayesian 
method. For the ML analyses including large data sets (fig. 2 
and supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), 
we used <rs type="software">RAxML</rs> (Stamatakis 2006), because this software 
tends to outperform PhyML under these conditions 
(Guindon et al. 2010). Optimal amino acid substitution 
models were determined by <rs type="software">ProtTest</rs> (Abascal et al. 2005). 
To identify invertebrate orthologs of ENC genes and to inves-
tigate the phylogenetic relationships within the ENC gene 
family, a data set that contained relevant representatives of 
each major vertebrate class for each ENC subtype was created 
(fig. 1B; see supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material 
online). We rooted the tree with the most closely related in-
vertebrate protein, B. floridae XP_002612442 (see below and 
fig. 2). Similarly, we constructed a molecular phylogeny of the 
complete KLHL superfamily (supplementary fig. S1, 
Supplementary Material online). Based on these inferred rela-
tionships, several invertebrate sequences that are closely </p>

<p>The aforementioned 5 
0 -and 3 
0 -cDNA fragments of S. canicula 
ENC1 were used as templates for riboprobes used in in situ hy-
bridizations. Paraffin-embedded section in situ hybridizations 
using S. canicula embryos were performed as described pre-
viously (Kuraku et al. 2005), with the modification that the 
acetylation step and the proteinase K treatment were skipped. 
Whole-mount in situ hybridizations on catshark embryos were 
performed according to a protocol originally developed for 
snake and lizard embryos (Di-PoE N, personal communication). 
Zebrafish standard whole-mount in situ hybridizations and 
double in situ hybridizations using the enc1 riboprobes labeled 
with digoxigenin-UTP and the egr2b riboprobes labeled with 
Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) 
were performed as described previously (Begemann et al. 
2001; Manousaki et al. 2011). In double in situ staining, 
enc1 transcripts were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/ 
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) and egrb2 tran-
scripts by a p-Iodonitrotetrazolium/BCIP-based detection. 
Stained embryos were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot micro-
scope. Immunohistochemistry on whole-mount S. canicula 
embryos was performed as described previously (Kuratani 
and Eichele 1993) with minor modifications. Monoclonal 
anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (Sigma T7451) was used to 
detect developing axons. As secondary antibody, AlexaFluor 
568 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L, Invitrogen A-11004) was ap-
plied, and the signal was detected using fluorescence micros-
copy (Leica). Images were processed with <rs type="software">Zeiss Axiovision</rs> and 
<rs type="software">Adobe Photoshop</rs> software. </p>

<p>To analyze the mode of the putative loss of ENC3 in euthe-
rians, we downloaded a list of Ensembl IDs of 79 genes har-
bored in the 1-Mb genomic region flanking ENC3 in chicken, 
together with IDs of human orthologs of those genes via the 
<rs type="software">BioMart</rs> interface. Human orthologs on chromosome 19 were 
plotted against the corresponding chicken chromosomal 
region (fig. 3). 
We analyzed the genomic regions up to 10 Mb flanking the 
three chicken ENC genes to search for conserved intragenomic 
synteny as instructed by Kuraku and Meyer (2012). Using the 
Ensembl "Gene Tree," we selected only pairs, triplets, or quar-
tets of paralogous genes that show a gene duplication pattern 
in accordance with the 2R-WGD (Dehal and Boore 2005). The 
conserved synteny is depicted in figure 4. </p>

<p>from February to May 2014. All participants were 
examined with disposable mirror, disposable probe, 
and disposable tweezers along with disposable masks 
and gloves. The examination procedure and forms used 
were based on WHO criteria. The inclusion criteria for 
the study were students between 6-12 years old, and 
residents of Dammam and Khobar municipality, as 
confirmed by the school registry. Each participant was 
asked questions regarding their age and brushing habits, 
and DMFT index was used to record the data, and the 
teeth, which were congenitally missing, or removed for 
orthodontic purposes were not considered as missing. 
To calculate the prevalence of dmft in primary teeth, 
the sum of dmft was divided by the sample size of 6-9-
year-old children. The same procedure was carried out 
to calculate the DMFT for permanent teeth for age 
between 10-12 years. 
The IBM <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for Social Sciences</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 19</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM Corp</rs>, Armonk, NY, 
USA) was used for data entry and analysis. Descriptive 
and inferential statistics were performed to analyze 
the data. T-test was used to analyze any statistically 
significant difference between gender, nationality, and 
brushing habits with prevalence of caries. The analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) was employed to check the 
significance between age and caries prevalence. The level 
of significance was set at 0.05. Post hoc test was also 
used to check for any significant increase, or decrease 
in dental caries due to increase in age. Inter-examiner 
agreement was analyzed using Kappa statistics, and a 
high degree of agreement (Kappa index: 89.7%) was 
observed between the 2 examiners. </p>

<p>The statistical analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> 
Statistics (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 16.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). 
Data are expressed as mean ± SD or median (Q1, Q3) for 
continuous variables and frequencies (percentages) for 
categorical variables. For between-group comparisons, 
Student's t-test was performed on variables with normal 
distributions, Chi-square test for categorical data, and Mann-
Whitney's U-test for variables with nonnormal distributions. 
For in-group comparisons, Paired t-test or Wilcoxon test was 
performed. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to 
model outcome at 12 weeks by treatment group corrected for 
baseline level of the outcome variable. All statistical tests 
were two-sided and assumed to be statistically significant 
at a level of P &lt; 0.05. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Differences in carriage rates and serotypes between the vacci-
nated group and control group were assessed using Fisher's ex-
act test or chi-squared test, as appropriate by <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> for Windows 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 11.5</rs> software package; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). These 
tests were also used to determine the differences in antibiotic 
resistance. </p>

<p>rarefaction curves, sequences were analyzed using FastGroupII program 27 with 
97% sequence similarity. Representative sequences from each OTU were compared 
with those in public databases using the <rs type="software">Seqmatch</rs> program from the Ribosomal 
Database Project (Release 10, Update 12) to identify the nearest neighbors. 
The specific primer and probe set for archaea, hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
(the orders Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales), and acetoclastic 
methanogens (the order Methanosarcinales) used in quantitative real-time PCR to 
determine the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were previously designed in the study 
by Yu et al. 28 All real-time PCR assays were performed with iCycler iQ using the iQ 
Supermix reaction kit (Bio-Rad, California, USA), as previously described in 
the study by Mayumi et al. 15 Standard curves for each assay were constructed using 
nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from Methanothermobacter 
thermautotrophicus strain delta H (DSM 1053) for the Archaea and the 
Methanobacteriales assays, Methanoculleus bourgensis strain MS2 (DSM3045) for 
the Methanomicrobiales assay, Methanosaeta thermophila strain PT (DSM 6194) 
for the Methanosarcinales assay. </p>

<p>The different publically available datasets used in this 
study were unified on a common genome build on the 
basis of the coordinates from TSS annotation data for 
miRNA genes from Marson et al. (21), namely NCBI36/ 
mm8. Accordingly, the coordinates of the PPARg-bound 
sites from Nielsen et al. (4) and Lefterova et al. (6) were 
lifted over from mm9 to mm8 using the <rs type="software">UCSC lift-over 
tool</rs>, while the coordinates from the datasets of Lefterova 
et al. (3) and Hamza et al. (5) were already based on mm8. 
For all datasets we used only published pre-analyzed data 
and the provided coordinates for PPARg-bound sites were 
used. First, miRNA gene TSSs within 50 kb of a PPARg 
binding site (Supplementary Table S1A-D) were 
identified. This was followed by checking whether an 
identified PPARg binding site overlaps with an in silico 
predicted PPRE (10) (Supplementary Table S2A-D). 
A third step detects, whether an identified PPARg 
binding site co-localizes with a CEBPa (CCAAT/ 
enhancer binding protein) binding site. As input data for 
the last step, PPARg-and CEBPa-bound sites provided 
by Lefterova et al. (3) were used and a threshold of 1 kb 
was applied to define a co-localized region. Further details 
can be provided upon request. </p>

<p>By far the highest induced miRNA tested in our 
analysis was miR-205. The exact significance of this induc-
tion for adipogenesis remains unclear for now. However, 
the list of predicted target mRNAs for miR-205 includes, 
for example, Runx2 (<rs id="software-3" type="software">TargetScan</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">5.2</rs>), a transcript 
encoding a transcription factor with an important role in 
favoring osteoblastogenesis over adipogenesis during mes-
enchymal stem cell differentiation (42). High levels of 
PPARg are known to suppress RUNX2 protein expres-
sion and induction of miR-205 might serve as a mechan-
ism to achieve this suppression. Indeed, Zhang et al. (43) 
recently showed that miR-205 can attenuate RUNX2 
protein accumulation together with nine other miRNAs 
in mouse osteoblasts. However, our preliminary experi-
ments have so far failed to demonstrate reduction in 
Runx2 mRNA levels upon miR-205 overexpression in 
pre-adipocytes (data not shown), suggesting that a com-
binatorial function of multiple miRNAs might be required 
for robust regulation of Runx2 at the mRNA level. 
Consistently, we were so far unable to demonstrate any 
significant impact of miR-205 overexpression on early 
adipogenesis in general, as measured by the expression 
levels of the known adipocyte marker genes such 
as Pparg and Cebpa (data not shown). Proteome-
or transcriptome-wide analysis upon gain-or loss-of-
function of miR-205 would be needed to reveal the 
primary targets mRNAs and pathways regulated by the 
robust induction of miR-205 during adipogenesis. 
Interestingly, we also found miR-378 and its host gene 
Ppargc1b as primary PPARg targets in adipocytes. 
miR-378 can induce lipogenesis and expression of lipogen-
ic genes, when overexpressed during adipogenesis of ST2 
mesenchymal precursors (44). Moreover, Ppargc1b is a 
known transcriptional co-activator responsible for 
inducing the target genes of numerous transcription 
factors (for example, sterol response element binding 
proteins, liver X receptors and PPARs) that are involved 
in regulation of lipogenesis and related processes (31). 
This suggests that PPARg may induce both miR-378 
and Ppargc1b, in order to allow both to function syner-
gistically in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Impor-
tantly, this induction is not limited to mouse 3T3-L1 
cells as miR-378 was recently identified as the most 
highly upregulated miRNA during the differentiation of 
both mouse and human primary adipocytes (26,45). 
In addition to miRNAs discussed above, a more 
detailed analysis of our initial list of putative PPARg 
target miRNA genes will lead to a more complete list of 
the true PPARg target miRNAs. Revealing the role of 
these miRNAs in adipogenesis and identification of 
their primary target mRNAs will be important for their 
integration to the regulatory networks governing 
adipogenesis. </p>

<p>Data linkage 
The first linked data were obtained in 2011. The data 
linkage was performed by the Centre for Health Record 
Linkage (CHeReL) which maintains a record linkage 
system for health-related data in NSW and the Australian 
Capital Territory in accordance with all ethical, legal, 
privacy and confidentiality requirements. The CHeReL 
keeps a Master Linkage Key that consists of continuously 
updated links between most NSW data sets. 
The DVA provided the CHeReL with an encrypted 
client number and personal information for all clients. 
The CHeReL then assigned a project person number 
(PPN) to each DVA client. A 'project key' containing the 
PPN and encrypted client number for each respective 
database is sent to the various data custodians who 
decrypted the client number and attached the PPNs and 
requested content variables. These were subsequently 
sent to the researchers stripped of personally identifying 
information such as name and address. All the data sets 
were joined by the researchers using the PPNs. This 
process is outlined in figure 1. 
The linkage used probabilistic matching 
37 using the 
record linkage software <rs type="software">ChoiceMaker</rs>, 
38 together with 
clerical review of possible matches. Probabilistic match-
ing assigns a weight to pairs of records based on how 
likely they are to be a true match based on a comparison 
of name, date of birth and address. Records with high 
weights are considered a true match while those with 
low weights are false matches; uncertain matches 
undergo clerical review. The cut-off for determining 
whether a match is true or false is chosen as to minimise 
the number of false positives, false negatives and the 
number of clerical reviews. 
39 The linkage algorithms 
take into account name reversals, name shortenings and 
a limited number of keystroke errors in date of birth. 
The CHeReL routinely performs these linkages, and </p>

<p>use of the medicine of interest using time-dependent 
Cox proportional hazard models. 
47 To best describe the 
relationship between the medicine of interest and the 
outcome, we will define medicine use in several different 
ways, using the daily dose information as described 
above, that is, any use, total cumulative dose, current 
dose, cumulative dose in the past 30 days, and recent ini-
tiation and/or discontinuation. Using different measures 
of medicine use will also allow us to perform sensitivity 
analyses to assess the robustness of our results. 
Analyses will be performed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">Version 9.3</rs>, 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">Version 12</rs> and R Version 3.1.0. </p>

<p>The primary endpoint was comparison of steady-state 
pharmacokinetics of simeprevir between subjects with 
severe renal impairment and matched subjects with normal 
renal function. The secondary endpoint was short-term 
safety and tolerability. No formal sample size determina-
tion was performed; a sample size of eight subjects per 
group was considered sufficient for pharmacokinetic 
assessment. Subjects who received at least one dose of the 
study medication were included in the analysis (intention-
to-treat population). Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic 
analysis was conducted with <rs id="software-0" type="software">WinNonlin Professional</rs> </p>

<p><rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 4.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Pharsight Corporation</rs>, Mountain View, CA, 
USA). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation 
[SD]) were calculated for total and unbound plasma con-
centrations at each time point. For the full pharmacokinetic 
profile, the minimum plasma concentration (C min ), maxi-
mum plasma concentration (C max ), and area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve at 24 h (AUC 24 ) on the 
logarithmic scale were the primary pharmacokinetic 
parameters of interest. A linear mixed-effects model 
(controlling for renal function) was used to estimate the 
least-squares (LS) means for each of the parameters. A 
90 % confidence interval (CI) was created around the dif-
ference between the LS means in the renal impairment and 
control groups. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for 
the comparison of the time to maximal plasma concentra-
tion (T max ) between groups. No formal hypothesis testing 
was performed. </p>

<p>We also examined trends over time in reporting ethical 
approval, reporting individual consent and quality of the 
consent processes, using logistic regression or ordinal 
logistic regression as appropriate, testing for assumptions 
of the models as appropriate and using a 5% signifi-
cance level in all analyses. Analyses were undertaken in 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">Stata</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">V.11</rs>. </p>

<p>parameters were used to obtain mean and SE values, which were then 
compared in unpaired t tests. Differences were considered significant at P Ͻ 
0.05. Analysis and curve fitting were carried out using <rs type="software">Graphpad Prism</rs> 
software. </p>

<p>All experimental sessions were conducted at the Behavioral and Experimental 
Economics laboratory Maastricht (BEELab) with 121 (65 male, 56 female) 
students from Maastricht University. The vast majority (88%) were students 
from Economics and Business Administration. The other subjects were stu-
dents from Law, Cultural Sciences, and from University College Maastricht. 
They were recruited through email announcements and announcements on 
the students' intranet. Each subject participated in only one session. The 
experiment was programmed in <rs id="software-1" type="software">Z-tree</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Fischbacher</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2007</rs>). 
In every session, exactly 11 subjects participated. They all received a show-
up fee of 4 euro. The average earnings per subject, including this show-up 
fee, were 12.98 euro. The experiment lasted 70 min on average. Between 
20 and 35 min were spent on reading the instructions. At the end of the 
instructions there was a short questionnaire to test whether subjects under-
stood the instructions. The experiment would continue only after all subjects 
understood the instructions. The instructions can be found in Appendix B. At 
the end of the experiment subjects were asked to answer some demographic 
questions. 
In reality individuals compare themselves with many others: friends, col-
leagues, neighbors, family, etc. In order to replicate the situation of one 
individual comparing himself with many others, we let subjects compare 
themselves not with only one other subject, but with all other subjects in the 
same session. Thus, when a subject makes a decision, there are ten others. 
The experiment consisted of 40 questions where subjects had to make 
choices between allocation lotteries. There were 28 individual risk questions 
and 12 peer risk questions. At the start of the experiment three practice 
questions were given. The order of the other 40 questions was randomized. We 
also randomized the left-right presentation on the screen. To determine the 
earnings of all subjects, at the end of each session one of the subjects and one 
of his questions was chosen at random. If this implied that the other subjects </p>

<p>The current generation of entering first-year 
students is so computer-literate that they rapidly 
learn how to use spreadsheet and statistical soft-
ware programs, such as <rs type="software">EXCEL</rs>, <rs type="software">Stat/Transfer</rs>, 
and <rs type="software">STATA</rs>. I heuristically explain the econo-
metric models we are using to them, and even if 
they have not had classes in statistics, they 
quickly understand the research that I am con-
ducting. Within a short time, we are working 
together on empirical research projects. These 
students also mention our work to their friends, 
and I often link up with other bright students 
through these referrals. 
Typically the type of research I do with my 
undergraduate students is not as sophisticated as 
the research I do with my graduate students or 
postdoctoral fellows. However, the research is 
of sufficiently high quality that since 2000 I 
have published six papers that had at least one 
undergraduate coauthor, and I have supervised 
the preparation of another two published papers 
in which undergraduates were the only authors 
(Dmitry Kotlyarenko and Ehrenberg, 2000; 
Ehrenberg and Christopher L. Smith, 2003, 
2004; Daniel B. Klaff and Ehrenberg, 2003; 
Ehrenberg et al., 2004a, b; Peter M. Crosta and 
Iris G. Packman, 2005; Matthew P. Nagowski, 
2005). Seven different undergraduate students 
were associated with these papers. 
One of these students, who came to Cornell 
wanting to be a lawyer, is now a second-year 
Ph.D. student in economics at MIT, and another 
would-be lawyer is a first-year Ph.D. student in 
the Economics of Education program at Colum-
bia Teachers College. A third student is apply-
ing to economics Ph.D. programs this year. A 
number of papers are in progress with other 
undergraduates, and I anticipate at least two 
more applications to Ph.D. programs will come 
from my group within the next two years, in-
cluding one from an underrepresented minority 
student. 
My students' decisions to pursue Ph.D. study 
is due partially to the enjoyment that they see I 
have working with them, partially to the fun that 
they have doing the research, and more gener-
ally from their learning what the life of an </p>

Pearson's correlation of 0.80, to achieve a statistical power 
of 80% at an α level of 0.05 (two-tailed), we estimated that 
about 9 subjects were needed 10) . Therefore, a total of ten 
subjects were recruited for this study. The selection criteria 
were as follows: 1) 20-29 years old, 2) no history of bone, 
joint disease or cardiorespiratory disease that have affected 
the exercise, and 3) voluntarily gave consent to take par-
ticipation in the research. This research was conducted with 
the approval of the Shinshu University School of Medicine 
Ethics Committee and Matsumoto City Hospital Ethics 
Committee. All subjects gave their written consent to par-
ticipation in this study. 
The breath-by-breath gas analyzer used in this study was 
the AT1100 by ANIMA (Tokyo, Japan). The gas analyzer 
was carefully calibrated before the start of measurement. 
The height of the chair used for the STSE was adjusted 
to the level of the upper end of the fibula head. Subjects 
were asked to cross their arms in front of their chest during 
exercise to prevent trick motion by the arm. The feet were 
placed in a comfortable position and set apart at shoulder 
breadth. Accordingly, subjects had to touch each target in 
the upright position and sitting position in order to define 
the STSE motion. The standing up frequencies of the STSE 
were set at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 times per minute, and 
subjects exercised for 5 minutes at each frequency with 5 
minutes of rest between each consecutive frequency trial. 
The frequency of standing up was controlled by audio sig-
nals given by a metronome. The criteria for the suspension 
of the test were as follows: 1) when it corresponded to gen-
eral discontinuance criteria for exercise tests 11) ; 2) when a 
heart rate reached 80% of the predicted maximum HR, or 3) 
if subjects missed the timing given by the audio signals for 
three times in a row 6) . When the steady state of VO 2 could 
not be confirmed after five minutes, the test was terminated. 
The steady state of VO 2 was evaluated by the difference in 
the VO 2 between the 3rd and 5th min (VO 2 5th − VO 2 3rd 
≤ 0) 12) . 
The measurement items were VO 2 , heart rate (HR), 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pres-
sure (DBP), and the Borg scale of rate of perceived exer-
tion (RPE) and fatigue of the leg. During testing, VO 2 , and 
HR were continuously measured. Respiratory gases were 
measured on a breath-by-breath basis. The breath-by-breath 
expired gas data were converted into time series data. The 
data sets were calculated using the gas analysis software of 
the AT1100, in which the variable moving average was per-
formed. The nine-point moving average of data was applied 
to the calculation for the respiratory gas parameters. The 
mean values of VO 2 and HR during the 30 seconds before 
the end of each standing up frequency were calculated. The 
rate of increase in HR at each standing up frequency to HR 
at rest (ΔHR) was calculated. After the exercise, BP and the 
Borg scale were measured. The temperature in the exercise 
room was maintained at between 21 °C and 24 °C.

<p>To investigate global protein expression in A549 cells after 
exposure to 20 μg/mL ZnONPs or Al-ZnONPs, supernatant 
fractions were collected after 2 and 4 hours of exposure. 
The preparation of samples for proteomic analyses has been 
reported previously. 
19 Briefly, the supernatants were diluted 
with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The samples were 
denatured and reduced with 8 M urea/10 mM dithiothreitol 
and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide. The samples were 
then digested with trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate 
and desalted by C18 columns. The tryptic peptides were then 
analyzed using a Q Exactive™ mass spectrometer (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Dionex UltiMate 
® 3000 
RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were 
separated by liquid chromatography using C18 columns 
(75×150 mm, 2 μm, Dionex Acclaim 
® PepMap™ RSLC; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific). The separation conditions have 
been described previously. 
19 Full mass spectrometry (MS) 
scans were performed using ranges of m/z 380-2,000, m/z 
380-600, m/z 600-800, m/z 800-1,200, and m/z 1,200-2,000, 
and the ten most intense ions from the MS scans were selected

<p>In vivo micro-CT 
Specimen scans were performed with a SkyScan 1172 high-resolution 
micro-CT (SkyScan N.V., Kontich, Belgium). Prior to scanning the 
specimens, a calibration scan was performed using synthetic bone, 
water, and air samples. The exposure parameters were 70 kV and 
140 mA. The number of projections was 481 and there were 938 
cross-sections. The total scan time was 20 min. The scanned images 
were reconstructed using <rs type="software">SkyScan CT-Analyser</rs> software and a modi-
fied cone-beam algorithm 
14 with 0.027 mm30.027 mm30.027 mm 
isotropic voxel spacing. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) 
image was then traced to the circumference of the original defect 
margins. This allowed the creation of a 3D reconstruction of the defect, 
which here after was referred to as the region of interest. The region of 
interest of each specimen was analysed for tissue volume (TV), bone 
volume (BV), bone volume fraction (BVF, BV/TV) and bone mineral 
density (BMD). </p>

<p>The quantitative data distribution was assessed using the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test. Because a non-normal distribution was detected, a 
Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks was performed. 
When the Kruskal-Wallis test result was significant (P,0.05), a post hoc 
Tukey test was used to identify the significantly different group means. 
The statistical analysis was performed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">18.0</rs> software (SPSS,

<p>The main treatment was first run as a series of sessions in which subjects faced 
games G1-G18, which we call Set I. In the light of the results from those games, 
we extended the study to a wider class of games with a greater variety of trade-offs 
between efficiency and equality. We ran a further set of sessions in which subjects 
faced G19-G30 and (as a consistency check) G1-G6, making up Set II. 
Each subject played the relevant 18 games in random order, not always with the 
same opponent, taking the favored role in some games and the unfavored role in 
others. 
10 Each participant was anonymously assigned to a matching group of four 
subjects, and for each game her opponent was chosen from the other three people 
in her group. This was known to the subject, but the matching sequence was varied 
so that subjects did not know which member of their group was their coplayer in 
any given game. Given the number of games to be played, it was infeasible to match 
subjects in a way that would allow each pair in any given game to be treated as an 
independent observation. Thus, to allow clean statistical tests with an acceptable 
degree of power, it was necessary to match subjects within small fixed groups and to 
use matching groups as the units of observation. Partner matching (i.e., a group size 
of two) would have introduced the possibility that pairs might try to equalize aver-
age payoffs over the 18 games, for example by alternating which player would get 
the larger share of the surplus. We judged that, with a group size of four and with no 
opportunities for free-form communication, group-level cooperation across games 
would be difficult to sustain. However, it is possible that the use of matching groups 
could have induced subjects to bargain less aggressively than they would have done 
in one-shot games. 
We used a variant of the random lottery incentive system. Each subject was paid 
her payoffs in 2 of the 18 games, chosen at random by the computer. This selection 
procedure was subject to the constraints that both players in a pair were paid for the 
same game and that each player in a matching group appeared in two of the selected 
pairs. 
The main treatment was run in June 2010 (for Set I) and November 2012 (for 
Set II) at the CBESS Experimental Laboratory at the University of East Anglia. 
Participants were recruited from the general student population using the ORSEE 
system (Greiner 2004), excluding individuals who participated in previous bargain-
ing table experiments. There were 144 subjects in the Set I sessions and 168 in the 
Set II sessions; no one participated in both. The bargaining protocol was imple-
mented using <rs type="software">z-Tree</rs> (Fischbacher 2007). Subjects' understanding of this protocol 
and other key aspects of the experiment was checked using a computerized ques-
tionnaire (which can be found in the online Appendix). Sessions lasted between 60 
and 80 minutes; earnings ranged between £5 and £25 with an average of £15.12, 
including a £5 show-up fee. </p>

identification. </p>

<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://promex.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/home.shtml</rs>). In addi-
tion, the relative phosphorylation state of the protein was 
analysed and quantified by comparing peak areas of the 
phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tryptic peptides 
derived from the same analysis (see also 'Determination 
of phosphorylation stoichiometry', and the workflow 
diagram in Fig. 1). 
M. truncatula nodule SuSy1 was found to be hyper-
phosphorylated, as the phosphopeptide was 1.7-fold more 
abundant than the non-phosphorylated peptide. The 
meaning of this hyperphosphorylation state remains the 
subject of much debate. In soybean, in vitro studies 
suggest that nodule SuSy sucrose-cleavage activity is not 
dependent on the phosphorylation state of the protein, but 
rather influences the attachment of this enzyme to the 
membrane (Zhang et al., 1999). However, studies in 
maize have shown that leaf SuSy is activated when 
phosphorylated at its primary site (Ser15), while phos-
phorylation at Ser170 would trigger degradation of the 
enzyme (Hardin et al., 2003, 2004). More recently, it has 
been suggested that sucrose concentration and phosphor-
ylation may regulate SuSy oligomerization and F-actin 
association in maize kernels and seedlings (Duncan and 
Huber, 2007). Regarding membrane attachment, Komina 
et al. (2002) investigated the phosphorylation state of 
membrane and soluble SuSy forms of nodules in soybean. 
Using several non-MS-based approaches, the microsomal 
SuSy fraction was found to be hypophosphorylated </p>

<p>This study has demonstrated for the first time the absolute 
quantification of three distinct M. truncatula SuSy isoforms 
in an independent tissue-specific manner. It is shown 
that, besides the nodule-enhanced SuSy1, two other protein 
isoforms are present in root nodules at quantifiable 
amounts. De novo sequencing allowed for the identification 
of a new peptide sequence, most probably driven from the 
second most abundant isoform SuSy2, which complements 
the existing sequence information based on transcript data. 
Absolute quantification of N metabolism enzymes was 
carried out, enabling the discrimination of different protein 
isoforms from a single analysis, even when those isoforms 
were present at very low amounts. Nodule SuSy1 was 
shown to be hyperphosphorylated at Ser11 in M. truncatula 
and novel phosphoproteins present in nodules were 
identified. All peptides found in this study can be viewed 
in the <rs type="software">ProMEX</rs> spectral library (Hummel et al., 2007). </p>

<p>The synovium-infiltrating cells (SIC) from arthritic Lewis rats treated with the vehicle

with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (all from 
Invitrogen), and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). For cytokine measurements, cells were 
stimulated for 5 h with 50 ng/mL PMA and 2 µM ionomycin in the presence of Brefeldin A 
(BD GolgiPlug). Cells were then treated with 10% normal rat serum to block non-specific 
binding sites. Thereafter, the T cells were surface-stained with anti-CD3 APC, anti-CD4 
PerCP eFlour 710, anti-CD8β FITC, and/or anti-CD25 PE (all from eBioscience). Antigen-

<p>where we only observe C if = I (C  *  
if &gt; 0). We estimate Eq. 6 using <rs type="software">STATA</rs>'s 
xtlogit command. The variance components σ 2 
e and σ 2 
a are estimated using maximum 
likelihood. The random family effect is estimated conditional on the random indi-
vidual effect being logistically distributed with mean zero, variance σ 2 
e = π 2 /3 and 
independent of a f . 
Inspired by the approach used in Mazumder (2008) and Björklund et al. (2010), 
we then go on to include potentially important family-wide variables, either one 
at a time or simultaneously, in the x if matrix. For example, consider the inclusion 
of parental income and education in x if . These additional control variables should 
reduce the residual variation in the outcome variable and produce a lower esti-
mate of the between-family variation, σ a 
2 *  , than the estimate produced without the 
added controls. Abstracting from measurement error, we can interpret the difference 
between these two estimates, σ a 
2 − σ a 
2 *  , as an upper bound on the amount of the 
variance in the family component that can be explained by parental income and edu-
cation. It is viewed as an upper bound since it includes other factors that are correlated 
with parental income and education. 10 </p>

<p>11 Sorting on unobservables may also occur. To the extent that these unobservable characteristics are 
uncorrelated with our control variables, they will bias our estimated neighborhood correlations upwards. 
12 In practice, we estimate neighborhood correlations after first randomly drawing one child from each 
family. We do this, so that large families living in small neighborhoods will not dominate the estimation. 
Alternatively, one could estimate neighborhood, family, and individual variance components simultane-
ously by applying <rs type="software">STATA</rs>'s xtmelogit to the whole sample and estimating a model with three levels. But 
due to our large sample, our use of control variables, and the large number of correlations that we need 
to calculate in this paper, this approach becomes infeasible; running time and convergence become prob-
lematic. In some cases, we have used both methods and the answer does not change. The fact that we 
randomly sample one child from each family does not seem to matter much either. </p>

<p>18 These correlations are estimated using <rs type="software">STATA</rs>'s xtlogit command. The outcome variables are always 
dichotomous. Year and gender dummies are included in these estimations. Singletons are included, except 
when estimating the sibling correlations for mixed siblings. The estimated correlations are never sensitive 
to the inclusion/exclusion of singletons. 
19 Mixed siblings are defined as follows. In a group of siblings of size N ≥ 2, x ≥ 1 siblings do not have 
the same gender as the other N − x siblings. Singletons are, therefore, always excluded. 
20 Finally, we note that when looking at sibling correlations for different birth cohorts, there is no notable 
trend in the correlations over time. This is true when controls are included and excluded and when looking 
at neighborhood correlations as well. </p>

age at first birth, and household type at age 15). Sibling correlations in columns (1) and (5) are estimated 
using <rs type="software">STATA</rs>'s xtlogit command. Sibling correlations reported in columns (2-4) are approximated using 
the following formula: 
ρ ≈ (OR φ − 1)/(OR φ + 1), where φ is calibrated using the odds ratios and sibling correlations estimated 
in columns (1) and (5). In the first row of sibling correlations (involving C 1

<p>distal femur was cut without placing a rod into the medullary 
canal (Fig. 1). The angle between the anatomical axis and the 
mechanical axis of the femur in the IM group was measured 
using a PACS system on a preoperative anterioposterior long 
leg standing radiograph. An intramedullary alignment rod was 
inserted based on the preoperative measurements, and the distal 
femur was cut. The entrance hole for the alignment rod in the 
femoral medullary canal was sealed with bone fragments before 
inserting the implant. An extramedullary alignment guide was 
used in both groups for proximal tibial cutting. A drainage tube 
was placed in the intra-articular space. After wound closure, a 
compression dressing using gauze and a bandage was applied, 
and the tourniquet was deflated. Drainage was discontinued 
from immediately after surgery until 2 hours after tourniquet 
deflation. All drains were removed 24 hours after surgery. 
Blood transfusion was performed when hemoglobin was &lt;8 
g/dL or when dyspnea, palpitation, dizziness, or abnormal 
vital signs were noted even if the hemoglobin was 8-10 g/dL. 
Rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant, was administered from 
immediately after the drain removal until the postoperative week

discontinued if hemarthrosis due to intra-articular bleeding was 
present or effusion from the surgical wound continued. Tests for

<p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
The RNAs were then reverse-transcribed using a Superscript II 
kit (Invitrogen) with the oligo(dT)15 primer according to the 
manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR was performed with 
a GoTaq® Green Master Mix PCR kit (Promega) in 20 μL of 
total reaction mixture containing 1 μL of the RT-reaction mixture 
and 0.5 μL of each primer (forward and reverse, 15 μM). The 
PCR primers sets and the thermocycling parameters used are 
listed in Table 1. The PCR samples were analyzed electroph-
oretically on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.2 mg/mL ethidium 
bromide at 90 V for 1 h. The bands were visualized under UV 
light. GAPDH transcripts served as internal controls. mRNA band

<p>Fig. 3. Effects of Schisandra chinensis water extract (SCWE) and digested SCWE (DSCWE) on the expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α mRNA in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with the IgE-antigen (DNP-HSA) complex. RBL-2H3 cells were preincubated with anti-DNP IgE (0.5 μg/mL) for 12 h, treated 
with various concentration (0, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 μg/mL) of SCWE or DSCWE for 30 min, and stimulated with DNP-HSA (1 μg/mL) for 2 h. The cells were then 
washed, lysed, and subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-α mRNA levels in each sample were normalized to 
GAPDH levels. mRNA band density was quantified using <rs type="software">SigmaGel</rs> software, and the group data were averaged and plotted. Means for each gene with different letters 
(a-e) differ significantly from each other (P &lt; 0.05), as determined by Duncan's multiple range test (n = 4). Control, C. </p>

<p>IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-α play important roles in allergic diseases 
[3]. Therefore, we determined whether SCWE and DSCWE could 
inhibit IL-4, IL-13 and TNF-α mRNA expression in RBL-2H3 
cells stimulated by the IgE-antigen complex (Fig. 3A and 3B). 
The IgE-antigen complex increased the accumulation of IL-4, 
IL-13, and TNF-α mRNA in RBL-2H3 cells, and this effect was 
significantly suppressed by treatment with SCWE or DSCWE 
(Fig. 3A and 3B). For example, treatment with 500 μg/mL SCWE 
suppressed the IgE-antigen complex-induced expression of IL-4 
and IL-13 mRNA by 8.3-and 2.8-fold, respectively compared 
to those in untreated cells (Fig. 3A). Moreover, treatment with 
500 μg/mL DSCWE reduced the IL-4 and IL-13 mRNA levels 
by 3.5-and 1.6-fold, respectively. Additionally, treatment with 
500 μg/mL SCWE and DSCWE inhibited TNF-α mRNA 
expression by 50.0-and 2.3-fold, respectively. SCWE inhibited 
IL-4 and TNF-α mRNA production slightly more potently than 
that of DSCWE (Fig. 3A and 3B). 
We also investigated the effect of SCWE or DSCWE treatment 
on IgE-antigen complex-induced IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-α protein 
production by Western blot analysis (IL-4 and IL-13) and ELISA 
(TNF-α). The Western blot results were analyzed using <rs type="software">SigmaGel</rs> 
software (Figs. 4B, 4C, 5B and 5C). The data showed that 
stimulating with the IgE-antigen complex increased IL-4, IL-13, 
and TNF-α protein levels in RBL-2H3 cells, and that treatment 
with 250, 500, and 1,000 μg/mL SCWE reduced IL-4 and IL-13 
protein levels (Fig. 4A-C). DSCWE at 500 and 1,000 μg/mL 
also reduced IL-4 and IL-13 protein levels (Fig. 5A-C). The 
inhibitory effect of SCWE was slightly more potent than that 
of DSCWE (Figs. 4A-5C). Moreover, SCWE or DSCWE 
treatment (100, 250, 500, and 1,000 μg/mL) led to a reduction 
in TNF-α protein levels, compared with that of untreated IgE-
antigen complex-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 6A and 6B). </p>

<p>Fig. 4. Effects of Schisandra chinensis water extract (SCWE) on interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 protein production in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with the IgE-antigen 
(DNP-HSA) complex. The cells were primed with anti-DNP IgE (0.5 μg/mL) for 12 h, treated with various concentrations (0, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 μg/mL) of SCWE 
for 30 min, stimulated with DNP-HSA (1 μg/mL) for 2 h, washed, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis. IL-4 and IL-13 protein levels in each sample were normalized 
to α-tubulin levels. Protein band density was quantified using <rs type="software">SigmaGel</rs> software, and the group data were averaged and plotted. Means for each protein with different 
letters (a-f) differ significantly from each other (P &lt; 0.05), as determined by Duncan's multiple range test (n = 4). Control, C. </p>

<p>Statistical approach 
We calculated the sample size for the main study 
results. 
15 On the basis of clinically important differences, 
the study required 100 physicians per trial arm to detect 
a minimum of 0.4% difference in A1c, 6 mm Hg in BP 
and 6 mg/dl in LDL for the main outcomes ( power 
80%, α=0.05, up to 20% dropout) (10 patients per phys-
ician at baseline and at follow-up). 
15 However, interven-
tion arm physicians were asked to provide 15 patient 
records at baseline (and not at follow-up) because of the 
need to construct audit and feedback reports as part of 
the intervention 
19 20 for A1c, BP and lipids, reflecting 
the fact that not all diabetes patients also have hyperten-
sion and hyperlipidaemia. The initial study was not 
powered to perform adjusted analysis for the intensifica-
tion outcomes of this report. 
All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. 
The relationship between the main and secondary out-
comes and the effect of the intervention were examined 
with generalied linear mixed models (GLMM), account-
ing for clustering of patients within physicians. ORs for 
follow-up versus baseline within the two groups were calcu-
lated, adjusting for covariates that differed between base-
line and follow-up patient populations; thus, the covariates 
included in these adjusted analyses included race, and 
clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. GLMM 
was implemented by PROC GLIMMIX in <rs type="software">SAS</rs> and was 
adjusted for race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or 
depression. Thus, the group coefficient represented differ-
ences between the intervention and control groups at 
baseline; the time of coefficient represented changes in 
the control group over time, thus capturing temporal 
trends. Finally, the group-by-time interaction coefficient 
represented the difference-of-differences for over-time 
change in the intervention versus control group, and was a 
direct comparison of over-time change for the interven-
tion versus the control group. A positive OR meant that 
the odds of a patient being in control increased more over 
time for the intervention versus control group. All analyses 
were performed in <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> V.<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.2</rs> (Cary, North Carolina, USA). </p>

<p>Detailed methods are described in the Supplementary Information. Briefly, 
four tumor-normal pairs of EITL were whole-exome sequenced using 
SureSelectXT Human All Exon V4+UTRs capture (Agilent Technologies, 
Santa Clara, CA, USA) and HiSeq 2000 Sequencing System (Illumina, San 
Diego, CA, USA). All candidate variants were visually inspected in 
<rs type="software">Integrative Genomics Viewer</rs>. 
19,20 Only <rs type="software">Integrative Genomics Viewer</rs>-true 
mutations were considered somatic and variants with frequency ⩾ 15% 
were further validated by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 2). 
Prevalence screening was performed for GNAI2, JAK3 and STAT5B genes 
in 42 tumor samples using amplicon deep sequencing. Only common 
hotspots reported in <rs id="software-7" type="software">COSMIC</rs> <rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">v.72</rs> and regions identified through WES 
were sequenced for each gene (Supplementary Table 3). CREBBP mutation </p>

<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Identification of somatic variants by WES 
To identify somatic mutations in EITL, we performed WES of four 
tumors with matching whole blood samples (Figure 1a). To 
maximize variant detection from a limited sample size, three 
different variant callers were applied-<rs type="software">Genome Analysis Toolkit</rs>, </p>

<p>MuTect 
25 and <rs type="software">Strelka</rs>. 
26 The mean depth of coverage was 126 × 
and on average 88% of targeted bases were covered by at least 20 
reads (Supplementary Table 6). Sanger validation of 296 candidate 
variants showed a false-positive rate of 3.72%. EITL samples 
presented a high mutation burden with an average of 85 
mutations per sample (range 59-137). A total of 340 nonsynon-
ymous somatic mutations were identified in 313 genes. Seven 
of those genes also harbored silent somatic mutations 
(Supplementary Table 5). The nonsynonymous variants comprised 
284 missense and 16 nonsense mutations, 13 frameshift indels, 25 
splice site mutations and 2 mutations resulting in loss of stop 
codon (Supplementary Figure 1a). As observed in most other </p>

<p>Prevalence screening of GNAI2, JAK3, STAT5B and CREBBP 
The high frequency of STAT5B, JAK3 and GNAI2 mutations in a 
small discovery cohort of only four samples was intriguing, 
prompting us to further analyze the prevalence of these mutations 
in a larger series of EITL samples. Forty-two additional EITL tumors 
(1 snap frozen and 41 archival samples) were screened for GNAI2, 
JAK3 and STAT5B mutations using amplicon deep sequencing. A 
total of 57 identified mutations were covered by an average of 
20 004 reads (range 104-175 515; Supplementary Table 8). As the 
amplicons covered only common mutation hotspots reported in 
<rs id="software-12" type="software">COSMIC</rs> <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">v.72</rs> and positions identified in the discovery cohort, it is 
likely that our results are lower-bound estimates of the true 
mutation frequency of these three genes. 
Figure 2 summarizes the results from both the discovery and 
prevalence cohorts. STAT5B mutations were detected in 25/42 
(60%) cases, with 24/42 (57%) carrying known activating muta-
tions (p.N642H) in the Src homology 2 dimerization domain 
(Figure 2b). JAK3 was mutated in 14/42 (33%) samples with 13/42 
(31%) harboring activating mutations (p.M511I, p.A573V and 
p.V674A/F), the majority located in the pseudokinase domain 
(Figure 2c). We identified two samples carrying two separate JAK3-
activating mutations and a remarkable three activating mutations 
were identified in a third case indicating profound alteration of 
JAK3 function in these patients. Notably, none of these samples 
contained an activating STAT5B mutation (Figure 2a). Collectively, 
the JAK-STAT pathway was altered in 32/42 (76%) cases. It is 
remarkable that a large subset of tumors harbor co-occurring 
activating mutations in two members of the same pathway. A 
similar phenomenon was recently described for JAK1 and STAT3 in 
systemic ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphomas. 
30 More-
over, these mutants were demonstrated to act in synergy to 
constitutively activate downstream STAT3 signaling. Further 
studies for mutated JAK3 and STAT5B are thus warranted and 
might shed light on EITL tumorigenesis. 
GNAI2 mutations were observed in 9/42 (21%) samples. Two 
major hotspots were identified-p.R179 and p.T182-both 
located in the GTP-binding domain (Figure 2d) and are known 
activating variants. 
31-33 A single case was found to contain both 
mutations. Although exhibiting a lower mutation incidence 
compared with STAT5B and JAK3, it has been suggested that the 
lower frequencies for G protein α-subunits could be explained by 
mutations in receptors coupled to these G proteins. 
34 On that 
note, both the GNAI2 wild-type discovery cohort samples 
harbored somatic mutations in GPCRs (Supplementary Table 5). 
It would be therefore interesting to analyze the mutational 
prevalence of GPCRs and other members of Gα i signaling in a 
larger cohort to determine the frequency at which this cascade is 
altered in EITL. 
Alterations in all three genes were found to be not mutually 
exclusive (JAK3 vs STAT5B: P-value = 0.2527; GNAI2 vs STAT5B: </p>

<p>modifications. Whole blood was also collected into PAXgene 
Blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechticon, Switzerland) 
from three males, derived from different litters, of each strain. 
Briefly, total RNA isolated from these four tissue sources was 
reverse-transcribed with an Oligo(dT)-T7 primer (Affymetrix, 
Santa Clara, CA, USA), and double-stranded complementary 
DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with the GeneChip Expression 
3 
0 -Amplification One-cycle kit (Affymetrix). In an in vitro 
transcription reaction with T7 RNA polymerase, the cDNA 
was linearly amplified and labeled with biotinylated nucleo-
tides (Affymetrix). A total of 10 mg of biotin-labeled and fragmented 
cRNA was then hybridized onto Rat Genome 230 2.0 
GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix) for 16 h at 45 1C. Post-hybri-
dization staining and washing were performed according to 
the manufacturer's protocols using the Fluidics Station 450 
instrument (Affymetrix). Finally, the arrays were scanned with 
a GeneChip Scanner 3000 laser confocal slide scanner. 
For the determination of peripheral chronic stress markers, 
whole blood was collected into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes 
from nonstressed and chronically stressed Fisher-344 (F344), 
Brown Norway (BN-SS), Lewis (Lew) and WKY male rats of 
B100 days of age and of different litters (n ¼ 3 per strain per 
experimental condition). The chronically stressed animals 
were restrained in a breathable decapicone for 2 h per day for 
a 2-week period. Total RNA was isolated using the PAXgene 
Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's 
instruction, and then reverse transcribed followed by second-
strand cDNA synthesis. For each sample, an in vitro trans-
cription reaction was carried out incorporating biotinylated 
nucleotides according to the manufacturer's protocol for 
Illumina Totalprep RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, 
TX, USA). Then, 1.5 mg biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized 
onto RatRef-12 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego 
CA, USA) for 16 h at 55 1C. Post-hybridization staining and 
washing were performed according to the manufacturer's 
protocols (Illumina). Illumina Sentrix RatRef-12 v1.0 Bead-
Chips were scanned using Illumina's BeadStation 500 
scanner. Images were checked for grid alignment and then 
quantified using the <rs type="software">BeadStudio</rs> software. 
The two sets of blood gene expression data came from 
different microarray platforms. For this reason, we carried out 
a detailed comparison between the Affymetrix and Illumina 
platforms used, and validated a number of selected tran-
scripts' abundances by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) as 
described previously. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses of microarray data. Analyses to establish 
significant differences in gene expression between WMI and 
WLI for the different tissues were carried out as described 
previously. 
24 Briefly, probe intensity data from Rat 230v2 
Affymetrix GeneChip arrays were read into the R software 
environment (http://www.R-project.org) directly from .CEL 
files using the <rs type="software">R/affy package</rs>. 
33 The normalization of the 
Affymetrix data was performed by tissue type using the 
robust multiarray average method for probe set data. </p>

<p>Probe intensity data from Illumina Chip arrays were read 
into the R software environment directly from Bead summary 
files produced by <rs type="software">BeadStudio</rs> using the <rs type="software">R/beadarray</rs> pack-
age. 
35 Quantile normalization was applied to the Illumina bead 
summary data using the <rs type="software">R/preprocessCore package</rs>. 
36 Data </p>

<p>quality was assessed using histograms of signal intensities, 
scatterplots, and hierarchical clustering of samples. 
Analysis of variance methods were used to statistically 
resolve gene expression differences from both studies after 
data processing and normalization using the <rs type="software">R/maanova 
package</rs>. </p>

<p>Study 2: human subjects: recruitment and procedures. 
The study was carried out from May through September, 
2009 and from July through December, 2010. Recruitment 
and experimental protocols were exactly the same, except 
for the addition in 2010 of a questionnaire about maltreat-
ment as a measure of chronic stress. 
Male and female subjects, 15-19 years of age, were 
recruited through community posters, other research studies 
at the Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, 
the Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) Adolescent Medi-
cine and Behavioral Health Clinics and private psychologists. 
Exclusion criteria were: age outside 15-19 years; Tanner 
Stage o5; major medical illness; antidepressant use in the 
past 3 months; no MDD, but another psychiatric disorder; 
MDD with psychosis; pregnancy; or history of mental retar-
dation. An additional exclusion criterion for the no disorder 
(ND) group was any lifetime psychiatric disorder. 
A total of 136 youths underwent telephone screening; 
73 were not eligible or refused participation; 10 could not 
be reached because of a disconnected phone. In total, 53 
participants were scheduled for appointments. 
The protocol was approved by the NCH Institutional Review 
Board. Appointments took place at NCH Clinical Research 
Services (CRS) with data collection standardized to 1600-
1700 h. Consent and assent were obtained upon arrival to the 
CRS. Blood was drawn into two PaxGene RNA (Qiagen) 
tubes. Trained research assistants conducted concurrent, but 
separate interviews with parents and youths about the young 
person's lifetime psychiatric symptoms and medical history. 
A youth self-report questionnaire about exposure to maltreat-
ment was added in the 2010 subsample. Parents received 
$30 for time and effort and transportation costs, and youths 
received $45. 
Pubertal stage was assessed with the Tanner Self-Rating 
Schematic Drawings. 
39 Demographic characteristics and the 
youth's lifetime medical history were evaluated through a brief 
interview with the parent and the Risks and Disorders sub-
domains of the Child Health and Illness Profile-Adolescent 
Edition (CHIP-AE). 
40 The lifetime history of psychiatric 
diagnoses was assessed with the computerized version of 
the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and Adoles-
cents-IV (CDISC-IV; NIMH, 1998), Parent and Youth Ver-
sions. The <rs type="software">CDISC</rs> is a structured psychiatric interview, 
organized into six Axis I diagnostic sections: Anxiety 
Disorders, Mood Disorders, Disruptive Behavior Disorders, 
Schizophrenia, Miscellaneous Disorders (for example, Eating 
Disorders) and Substance-Use Disorders. 
41 Psychometric 
testing of the <rs type="software">CDISC</rs> has demonstrated good validity and 
reliability. 
42,43 Every participant and parent received the entire 
diagnostic assessment. 
In 2010, we also explored whether exposure to chronic 
stress in humans, as defined by maltreatment, correlated with 
the levels of gene transcripts derived from the chronic stress </p>

<p>Determination of blood transcript levels of candidate 
markers. Blood was drawn on all participants, but the only 
samples sent to the Redei lab were those of youths suffering 
from current MDD or those without any disorder (ND). The 
Redei lab was blind to any information about the participants. 
Whole-blood RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Blood 
RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction; 
cDNA was prepared using random primers and the TaqMan 
RT reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 
Specific primers, listed in Supplementary Table S1, were 
designed to amplify the human ortholog of the rat microarray 
probe region of the candidate markers using the ABI's <rs id="software-28" type="software">Primer 
Express</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#software-28" type="version-number">version 3.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-28" type="creator">PE Applied Biosystems</rs>). 
qPCR was carried out using SYBR Green and the ABI 7900 
(Applied Biosystems), with 18s rRNA as the internal control. 
18s was chosen as the normalizing gene after an extensive 
comparative pilot study using several housekeeping genes 
(data not shown). Each sample for each transcript was 
measured in triplicate using 5 ng of template. 
The DCT values from qPCR were used to characterize 
transcript abundance. DCT is the cycle threshold difference 
between the target gene and the housekeeping gene, which in 
this case is 18s. This method, as opposed to the relative 
quantification approach in which the DCT values are normali-
zed to the control group giving DDCT, will also indicate the 
variation within the ND samples. DDCT is the DCT of 
the disorder group subtracting DCT of the ND group. The 
relative expression for each transcript and each sample is 
determined from DCT by raising 2 to the power of the negative 
value of DCT. A fold change can then be calculated by raising 
2 to the power of the negative value of DDCT for each sample. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses of human data. Descriptive statistics 
were used to characterize the sample, and nonparametric 
statistics to analyze gene expression differences between 
the ND and MDD groups or between the MDD subgroups 
with and without comorbid anxiety disorders. Spearman's rho 
correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relation-
ships between the CTQ scores and gene expression levels. 
Because this is a pilot study, effect sizes are more infor-
mative than statistical significance. We calculated effect 
sizes for all differences between means, using Hedges' 
because of small sample and unequal subgroup sizes. 
Correlation coefficients themselves can serve as estimates 
of effect sizes, and hence we report rho values for these 
analyses. We made an a priori decision to interpret an effect 
size of X0.50 as clinically significant, which corresponds to 
Cohen's medium effect size. 
45 We did not control for multiple 
comparisons, as the goal of a pilot study is to detect as many 
potentially clinically significant relationships as possible. Data 
analyses were performed with <rs id="software-19" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-19" type="version-number">14.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-19" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>.,

not complete the study, one patient of the placebo 
group died without any known immediate cause. 
Ten others dropped out from the study within one 
month of the trial. Three patients of the test group 
who came from other places returned to their 
homes for completion of DOTS therapy as they 
were unable to in Bangalore until the completion 
of the DOTS regime. Fourteen cases did not 
complete the study. The remaining 40 patients

<p>Tests on the Escherichia/Shigella 26 genomes 
We next assessed the algorithm using 26 completed 
genomes from the genus Escherichia/Shigella. The 
accuracy of co-phylog was evaluated based on the symmet-
ric differences between the co-phylog (where S = C 9,9 O 1 ) 
tree and the benchmark tree. Two other phylogenomic 
tools, CVtree (http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/cvtree/) and Kr 
(22) (http://guanine.evolbio.mpg.de/kr2/) were also used 
to build trees, and the trees' accuracies were evaluated in 
the same way. We then made comparisons of the trees' 
accuracies among the different phylogenomic methods. 
The symmetric differences were evaluated using the 
'<rs type="software">treedist</rs>' program that is contained in the <rs id="software-1" type="software">PHYLIP 
package</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip.html</rs>).

<p>Tests on Enterobacteriaceae 63 genomes and 
Gammaproteobacteria 70 genomes 
We next examined if the co-phylog method was feasible 
when applied to high-level taxonomies. In the first stage 
of the experiment, we tested co-phylog (S = C 9,9 O 1 ) at the 
family level using 63 genomes randomly picked from 
Enterobacteriaceae. The reconstructed phylogenetic rela-
tionship based on 16S rDNA sequences alignment is 
used as the benchmark. We then tested co-phylog 
(S = C 9,9 O 1 ) on the class level using 70 genomes 
randomly picked from Gammaproteobacteria (we skipped 
the order level because Enterobacteriaceae is the only 
family under the order it belongs to). This co-phylog tree 
was compared with the known taxonomy. 
The 16S rDNA tree was generated as follows. For each 
organism, we first retrieved its 16S rDNA sequence using the 
'Browsers' on the Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp 
.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp) website, and then created MSA of 
these 16S rDNAs and built a tree using the '<rs id="software-3" type="software">Tree Builder</rs>' 
tools (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/treebuilderpub/index.jsp</rs>) (25). </p>

<p>13 ) at the same 
depth for the Brucella 13 genomes (G 1 , G 2 ,., G 13 ). All of 
the reads simulated in the perfect NGS datasets were 
75 bp, error-free and uniformly distributed, which 
allowed us exclude any variation introduced by the 
sequencing experiment itself. The corresponding 
co-phylog (with S = C 15,15 O 1 ) tree was constructed using 
each of the five perfect NGS datasets as input, and the 
benchmark tree was constructed using the 'sequencing 
sample genomes' as input. The minimal proportion P of 
the genome that was required by co-phylog was estimated 
by finding the depth at which the tree generated begins to 
be identical to the benchmark tree. 
When the co-phylog method was applied to a real NGS 
dataset, L(S)-tuple with a minimum base quality under the 
threshold F were filtered (see the algorithm section). 
A dilemma in choosing the F value was that too small 
of an F might allow too many L(S)-tuple with 'wrong' 
objects past the filtering and therefore enlarge the devi-
ation of the co-distance computed, while too large of an 
F might filter too much genomic information. We there-
fore explored the proper value range of F using simulated 
NGS data with sequencing qualities, which were generated 
using the tool '<rs type="software">Maq simulation</rs>' in the <rs id="software-6" type="software">MAQ package</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-6" type="url">http://maq.sourceforge.net</rs>/). MAQ NGS data (distin-
guished from the perfect NGS data, using genome B. 
abortus 2308) of different depths were generated and dif-
ferent F values were tested on these MAQ NGS data; the 
proper range of F values were determined according to 
the co-distance d co (G 
0 , G) between the MAQ NGS data 
G 
0 and the complete genome G and the proportion q of 
genomic information taken by co-phylog. </p>

<p>phylogenetic analysis of unassembled NGS data. And as 
these NGS raw data came from all three popular 
sequencing platforms (<rs type="software">454</rs>, <rs type="software">Illumina</rs> and <rs type="software">SOLID</rs>) 
(Supplementary Table S1), co-phylog is robust to the 
choice of sequencing platforms. The co-phylog tree (using 
S = C 12,12 O 1 , according to Supplementary Equation (S2) 
and F = 10) constructed on the NGS dataset from the five 
large diploid organisms matched well with the known 
taxonomy (Supplementary Figure S3), illustrating that 
the tool co-phylog can handle large size analyses and the 
complication of diploidy. 
The time and memory consumption of <rs type="software">co-phylog 
program</rs> (coded in C) were tested on a platform equipped 
with Intel Xeon X5650 2.67 GHz cpu (only one cpu was 
used for this test) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 
SP2 (Â86_64). For real NGS dataset from the E. coli 29, 
which have an average sequencing depth of 95Â, co-phylog 
took 160M memory and 19 min completing the whole 
computing, including 14 min converting all NGS data 
into corresponding context-object sets and 5 min 
computing all pairwise co-distances. For the five mamma-
lian organisms, <rs type="software">co-phylog</rs> took 60G memory and 20 h 
completing the whole computing, including 17 h converting 
all NGS data into corresponding context-object sets and 
3 h computing all pairwise co-distances. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Comparisons between variables were tested using the chi-square 
test or Student's t-test. We constructed a logistic regression mod-
el with obstructive lung disease as the dependent variable and 
age, sex, smoking history (more than 2 weeks), and TB lesions 
on CXR as independent variables. A forward selection method 
was used to exclude multi-colinearity of each variable. Odds ra-
tios (ORs) were calculated with <rs id="software-0" type="software">PASW</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">17.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago,

high speed for 10 sec, and dispensed into the port "S" of the 
Xpert MRSA cartridge. The cartridge was inserted and subjected 
to real-time PCR in the <rs id="software-0" type="software">GeneXpert</rs> system, and the result was 
reported by the GeneXpert software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Cepheid</rs>). If the MRSA

compared the change in AUC in virtual patients who were simulated for several dif-
ferent scenarios of generic substitution. In four scenarios of original (branded) to 
generic and generic to generic substitution, 5,000 virtual patients were simulated per 
scenario using the programming software R. The mean population AUC of gener-
ics ranged from 90-110% (scenarios A and B) and 80-123.5% (scenarios C and D) 
of the AUC of the original. Those patients who had an AUC change (ratio) as a result 
of drug substitution of less than 0.67 or greater than 1.5 were considered to be in 
potential danger due to the substitution. We found that less than 6% of patients fell 
outside of the cutoff range of 0.67-1.5 as a result of original to generic substitution. 
However, in the case of generic to generic substitution, the proportion was as high 
as 9-12%. This alerts us to the potential danger of generic substitution, especially 
for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices. </p>

We further used a multivariate Cox regression model to adjust

<p>Forty-three patients with COPD have been recently studied 
with 6-and 64-detector row CT scanners (Siemens Medi-
cal Solutions, Forchheim, Germany). All whole-lung CT 
scans were acquired during one deep inspiratory breath-hold 
without the use of any contrast medium. Both scanners were 
daily calibrated on air to allow reliable measurements and 
comparison between examinations. Standard 6-detector row 
CT scanner parameters were as follows: 120 kV, effective 
120 mAs, individual detector collimation 1 mm, gantry rota-
tion time of 0.5 second, and pitch 1.25. The 64-detector row 
CT scanner parameters were as follows: 120 kV, effective 
100 mAs, individual detector collimation 0.6 mm, gantry 
rotation time of 0.5 second, and pitch 1. 
CT images data were reconstructed at 1-mm-thick sec-
tions with a reconstruction increment of 1 mm and a sharp 
kernel (B70f). They were transferred to a personal computer 
running <rs id="software-0" type="software">MevisPULMO</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 1.4</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Fraunhofer MEVIS</rs>, Bremen, Germany) and analyzed for quantitative 
emphysema assessment by one operator (NS). A 3×3 kernel-
based axial Gauss smoothing was applied to minimize the 
noise in sharp kernel images. For the whole lung, emphysema 
extent was defined as percentage of lung voxels #-950 
Hounsfield units. </p>

<p>Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or 
median (interquartile range) depending on the normality 
of data, assessed by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
Consequently, controls and patients with COPD were com-
pared for each variable using parametric or nonparametric 
univariate statistics (Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test). 
Pearson correlations were performed to analyze the associa-
tions between variables of lung function (such as GOLD 
class, spirometry data, and emphysema score) and cardiac 
chamber size. 
Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the rela-
tionship between COPD disease and the echocardiographic-
based variables (LVM, RWT, and LV EDD), with age, heart 
rate (HR), BMI, and systolic BP or pulmonary pressure, 
respectively, for LV or RV parameters as the covariates. 
Smoking habits, FEV 1 , and FEV 1 /FVC were not included in 
the analysis as collinear with the presence of COPD disease 
(R-values .0.5 and variance inflation factor in multivariate 
models .2). 
To test if RWT was predictive of the severity of COPD 
disease in patients with COPD, receiver operating character-
istic (ROC) curve was done reporting the area under curve 
(AUC) value as general diagnostic tool, and the flex point, 
ie, where the sum of sensitivity and specificity reached a 
maximum, was used to divide the patients with COPD into 
two groups. 
Hospitalizations for patients with COPD were considered 
as 1) overall number of hospitalizations for COPD and/or 
CV events normalized for observation time, rounding the 
number as integer in 10 years and 2) time elapsing from 
the start of the study and the first hospitalization. In the first 
case, because of the distribution of hospitalization, an over-
dispersed Poisson regression model was performed. In the 
second case, a Cox regression model was applied. In both 
cases, the categorical variable RWT # cutoff point and . 
cutoff point was used. 
A two-tailed P-value ,0.05 was always considered as 
significant. <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">22.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM Corporation</rs>, Armonk, NY,

<p>). Both constructs 
were generously provided by Dr Richard G Pestell, Department of 
Oncology, Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, 
DC, USA. A dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) was used to detect promoter activity in this study. A synthetic 
renilla luciferase reporter plasmid Phrl-SV40 (Promega, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) was used as a control for transfection efficiency. Panc-1 cells 
expressing different MUC1 constructs were cultured in DMEM plus 5% fetal 
bovine serum, and 10 000 cells/well were seeded into a 48-well plate and 
grown to B95% confluence. Each well was washed twice with PBS and 
transfected with 300 or 600 ng plasmid DNA using 2 ml Lipofectin 
(Invitrogen) in 200 ml Optimem (Life Technologies), respectively. After 
24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, fed with 3 ml DMEM plus 10% fetal 
bovine serum and cultured for another 2 days. The cells were then washed 
twice with PBS and harvested with 200 ml Passive Lysis buffer (Promega, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific). To detect firefly luciferase activity (from pA3 
plasmids with cyclin D1 promoter), 20 ml of each lysate was reacted with 
100 ml LARII buffer (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on ice. Relative light 
emission was detected using an Optocomp1 luminometer (MGM Instruments 
Inc, Hamden, CT, USA) reading 10 s with a 2-s delay. Subsequently, to detect 
the renilla luciferase activity (from SV-40 plasmids as transfection efficiency 
control), 100 ml Stop&amp;Glo Reagent (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was 
added into each well. The solution was vortexed for five seconds, and read 
again with the Optocomp1 luminometer. Light emission data (mean of 
triplicates) were presented as relative lumenescence units for each cell line 
and analyzed for statistical significance using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Prism</rs> and <rs type="software">InStat</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad Software Inc.</rs>., La Jolla, CA, USA). Each experiment shown is 
representative of three independent replicates. </p>

<p>The sequence similarity of the genes isolated in this study 
was determined using the online BLAST (Altschul et al., 
1997) and <rs id="software-12" type="software">BLAST</rs> <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">2</rs> sequence (<rs corresp="#software-12" type="creator">Tatusova and Madden</rs>, 
1999) programs on the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> website (National Library of Medi-
cine, Bethesda, MD). For sequence comparison throughout 
the <rs id="software-14" type="software">BLAST</rs> <rs corresp="#software-14" type="version-number">2</rs> program, two additional parameters were 
introduced, Qcov and Scov, which allows us to take into 
account the difference of the length between sequences. 
Query coverage (Qcov) is the ratio of length of the match by 
length of the query sequence. This value indicates the part 
of the query sequence covered by the alignment. Similarly, 
Subject coverage (Scov) was calculated as the ratio of length 
of the match by length of the subject or target length, and 
indicates the part of the subject or target sequence covered 
by the alignment. </p>

<p>All sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree construc-
tion were performed using the ClustalX algorithm with the 
Gonnet residue weights (Thompson et al., 1997). For XTHs 
genes, the pair-wise alignment parameters used included 
a gap opening penalty of 35 and a gap extension penalty of 
0.75. For multiple alignments, the gap opening penalty was 
15, with a gap extension penalty of 0.3 and the delay 
divergent sequences was set at 25%. The consensus tree was 
drawn using the <rs id="software-15" type="software">TREE VIEW</rs> program (<rs corresp="#software-15" type="creator">Page</rs>, 1996). 
Search motifs in the promoter regions of MA-PME 
genomic sequences was found by screening the PLACE 
(Prestridge, 1991; Higo et al., 1999) and PLANT CARE 
(Lescot et al., 2002) databases. In silico prediction of 5#-
and 3#-UTR regions of MA-PME genes and prediction of 
signal peptides were performed using EuGène <rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-number">3.2</rs> with rice 
parameters (Foissac et al., 2008) and SignalP <rs corresp="#software-18" type="version-number">3.0</rs> (Bendtsen 
et al., 2004) programs, respectively. </p>

<p>the high percentage of identity (75%) observed between 
these sequences is not significant as it was obtained in 
a short portion of their nucleotide sequence, as shown by 
the low Scov and Qcov values (less than 10% with 
MaPME2 and 25% with MaPME3). At the polypeptide 
level, MaPME2 and MaPME3 shared 46% and 60% 
identity and similarity, respectively, with polypeptides 
predicted from MaPME1 cDNA. The predicted polypep-
tides of the three MaPME genes presented features that are 
conserved in all PME polypeptides. Among these, there are 
the pre-and pro-sequences at the N-terminal extension, and 
five polypeptide segments that are characteristic of the 
C-terminal catalytic region, which constitutes the mature 
PME enzyme: GxYxE, QAVAL, QDTL, DFIFG, LGRPW 
(Micheli, 2001; Markovic and Janecek, 2004; see Supple-
mentary Fig. S2 at JXB online). The pre-region or signal 
peptide required for protein targeting to the endoplasmic 
reticulum is cleaved in the first step of maturation. Accord-
ing to the SignalP <rs corresp="#software-22" type="version-number">3.0</rs> program (Bendtsen et al., 2004); it 
was localized between amino acid residues 24-25 and 27-28 
for MaPME2 and MaPME3, respectively. Pro-sequence 
cleavage of the covalently attached mature enzyme may 
occur in the second step of maturation close to the 
RR(K)LL(M) motif (Markovic and Janecek, 2004; see 
Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online), thus leading to pro-
sequence lengths of 200 and 217 amino acid residues for 
MaPME2 and MaPME3, respectively. Based on the 
Arabidopsis PME sequence analysis, PME genes have been 
classified into two types: type I and II, having a long 
N-terminal pro-region and a short or absent pro-region, 
respectively. The role of the pro-region is currently un-
known (Micheli, 2001; Markovic and Janecek, 2004; 
Giovane et al., 2004; Pelloux, 2007). The long N-terminal 
pro-sequence of MaPME2 and MaPME3 predicted poly-
peptides suggests that both genes belong to type I. </p>

regions in common between the XTH polypeptide sequences of banana (MaXTHn and MaXETn), tomato (SlXTHn), Arabidopsis (AtXTHn), 
and rice were used to contruct a phylogenetic tree using the <rs type="software">ClustalX</rs> program. The resulting slanted cladogram was visualized with the 
TREEVIEW program (Page, 1996). The sequences were grouped into two distinct groups (I-II). The numbers 1 to 4 indicate the four 
families groups identified in tomato and Arabidopsis and applied to a broad range of plant species (Nishitani, 1997; Campbell and 
Braam, 1999; Rose et al., 2002; Saladié et al., 2006). The tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana XTH sequences used in this study are 
available online at http://labs.plantbio.cornell.edu/XTH/genes.htm. The rice XTHs were retrieved from the Rice genome research program 
(http://RiceGAAS.dna.affrc.go.jp, 7 February 2009) and are indicated in the cladogram by their gene number assigned by RiceGAAS. 
Banana MaXET1 and MaXET2 have been registered in GenBank under accession numbers EF103137 and EF103136, respectively. </p>

<p>All EMSA autoradiographs were scanned and the integrated 
band intensities were quantified using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Intelligent 
Quantifier</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Bio Image</rs>). For each lane, the back-
ground intensity was also measured and subtracted from the 
band intensities. Only the integrated intensities (I.I.) from 
the unbound DNA bands were considered for further analysis 
because of the 'smearing' effect. All I.I. values where divided 
by the average of two I.I. measurements of free DNA (with-
out addition of Ss-LrpB). This corresponds to the fraction of 
unbound DNA. The fraction of bound DNA in each lane was 
then calculated to be: fraction bound DNA ¼ 1 À fraction 
unbound DNA. These quantitated data were plotted versus 
Ss-LrpB concentration (binding profile) and fitted using the 
Hill equation (Origin, non-linear least squares method): </p>

<p>Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sub-
jects and were summarized as the mean±standard deviation or 
the median (range) for continuous data. The Student's t-test or the 
Mann-Whitney U-test was employed to compare continuous vari-
ables between the groups, where appropriate. The chi-square test 
or the Fisher exact test was performed to compare categorical 
variables between groups.

<p>Microscopy 
All samples were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS before immunostaining. Stained 
coverslips or slides were mounted in Tris-buffered Fluoro-Gel (Electron 
Microscopy Sciences). Src and GFP-K17 colocalization was imaged by con-
focal microscopy (at room temperature with an Axiovert 200 microscope 
equipped with the 510 META module; Carl Zeiss). Images were taken using 
the 63× objective (1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil objective), and acquisi-
tion was performed via <rs id="software-2" type="software">LSM</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">510</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Carl Zeiss</rs>). Goat anti-rabbit 
secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) was used 
to image Src staining, and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conju-
gated to Alexa Fluor 488 was used to enhance GFP signal (Invitrogen). 
p-Y416 Src and K6 staining in WT mouse wounds were imaged by confo-
cal microscopy (Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with the 510 META 
module at room temperature). Images were taken using the 20× (0.75 NA 
Plan-Apochromat air) and 40× (1.3 NA Plan-NEOFLUAR oil) objectives, 
and acquisition was performed via <rs id="software-3" type="software">LSM</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">510</rs> software. Goat anti-rabbit 
secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 was used in each 
case. Cell stains used to assess Src and focal adhesion protein localization 
were performed from WT and K6 
/ keratinocytes in primary culture 
seeded on fibronectin (EMD)-coated coverslips (final concentration of 
10 µg/ml and diluted in 1× PBS). p-Y416 Src/SFK, vinculin, p-Y925 FAK, 
p-Y410 CAS, and p-Y118 paxillin immunostainings were imaged on a fluor-
escent microscope (Axio Observer.Z1; Carl Zeiss) at room temperature. 
Images were taken using the 63× objective (1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil 
objective) and acquired via <rs type="software">AxioVision</rs> software with a camera (AxioCam 
MRm) and saved as raw data files (Carl Zeiss). Secondary antibodies con-
jugated to Alexa Fluor 594 or 488 (Invitrogen) were used to image. Analy-
sis of all images was performed using the <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> freeware. </p>

<p>Explant outgrowth 
Culture of newborn mouse skin explants was performed as previously de-
scribed (Mazzalupo et al., 2002; Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot 
et al., 2004). In brief, 4-mm punch biopsies were cultured in mouse kera-
tinocyte (mKER) medium for 8 d. The tissue moiety (original punch) was 
removed, cellular outgrowths were collected into lysis buffer (Wong and 
Coulombe, 2003), and cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared 
as previously described (Osmanagic-Myers and Wiche, 2004). Cells 
were incubated in the presence of 0.01% digitonin and spun down, and 
pellets were resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer. 
Quantitative outgrowth assays were performed under the same condi-
tions using 2-mm punch biopsies, except that on day 3, explants were 
treated with mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h to irreversibly inhibit 
DNA replication and mitosis (Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot et al., 
2004) and then with (or without) PP2 (Life Technologies) at various con-
centrations. PP2 treatments continued from day 3 to day 6, at which point 
both punch and outgrowth were fixed and stained with Giemsa dye 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Stained outgrowths were scanned, and the outgrowth 
area was measured using the <rs id="software-4" type="software">ImageJ</rs> freeware (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>), as previously described (Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot 
et al., 2004), by subtracting the area of the punch (square pixels) from 
the total area of punch and outgrowth (square pixels). Student's t test was 
applied to determine probability values. </p>

<p>Scratch wounding 
Newborn mouse skin keratinocytes were seeded for primary culture in two-
or four-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and allowed to reach 
confluency as a monolayer (24 h after plating). Cells were then serum 
starved overnight. At 48 h of culture, monolayers were scratched with a 
P200 pipette tip, and the mKER medium was replaced. Keratinocytes were 
allowed to migrate for 24 h and then fixed in 4% PFA for analysis. Both 
WT and K6 
/ primary keratinocytes were imaged via K17 immunostain-
ing (Mazzalupo et al., 2002; Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot et al., 
2004). Area and distance of outgrowth were quantified using the freeware 
<rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. Area of outgrowth was computed as the area of initial wound minus 
the area of wound remaining at 24 h, whereas distance of outgrowth is the 
straight-line distance from the wound edge to the leading cell periphery 
along the line and was measured multiple times for every wound sample to 
correct for potential local differences in keratinocyte migration. Outgrowth 
was then expressed relative to WT values, and Student's t test analysis was 
used to calculate probability values. </p>

<p>Data quantitation 
Src activity was quantified from Western blot signals using the <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> free-
ware to measure band intensity and normalize it to caveolin to adjust for 
loading. The final data for K6 
/ samples are reported relative to WT. Src 
activity was also quantified at the leading edge of keratinocytes in immuno-
stained preparations using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. The leading edge of WT or K6 </p>

<p>cells was traced in <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> and quantified for mean pixel intensity and sur-
face area. Values reported are a ratio of mean pixel intensity at the lead-
ing edge per area of leading edge. In cosedimentation assays in vitro 
involving reconstituted keratin filaments, the fraction of bound proteins (Src 
FL or Src CD) was quantified using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> in a similar manner, except that 
signal intensity of pelleted Src was divided by total Src signal intensity (total 
found in supernatant and pellet fractions). Similarly, Src's activity status in 
this in vitro setting was quantitated in the same fashion, except that an 
activity ratio was obtained by relating the intensity of the phospho-Src signal 
in presence and absence of keratin filaments. </p>

<p>The quantitation was conducted with <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Applied Biosystems</rs> <rs id="software-2" type="software">7300 
Real-Time PCR System</rs> by using SYBR Green I Dye (Life 
Technologies). </p>

<p>The recombinant plasmids were transfected to 10T1/2 cells with 
GeneJammer Transfection Reagent (Stratagene, Agilent, Santa 
Clara, CA). The transfected cells were fixed with 4% PFA in phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% 
Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. They were incubated with anti-vinculin 
mAb hVIN-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-fascin mAb (Merck 
Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-β-tubulin mAb E7 (Developmental 
Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), or 
anti-mDia3 pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 
then incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-goat anti-mouse or rabbit 
immunoglobulin G or Alexa Fluor 546-phalloidin (Life Technologies, 
Carlsbad, CA). The specimens were observed with a Carl Zeiss 
(Oberkochen, Germany) confocal laser-scanning microscope LSM 
410 or with an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) confocal laser-scanning 
microscope FV-1000D. 
For live imaging, cells were cultured on 35-mm glass base dishes 
and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 during observation. For stimula-
tion of RhoD(wt)-transfected 10T1/2 cells with FGFs, the cells were 
cultured for 24 h in serum-free DMEM before addition of FGFs. The 
cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml FGF2, FGF4, or FGF8 (Wako 
Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) premixed with 15 μg/ml 
heparin sodium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). For analysis of the 
protrusions extending toward FGF-coated beads, &gt;100-μm-diameter 
heparin-acrylic beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were sorted out with Cell 
Strainer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The beads were soaked 
in 100 ng/ml FGF and washed once with PBS. They were placed in 
the culture of RhoD(wt)-transfected and serum-starved 10T1/2 cells. 
These cells were observed with either the Olympus confocal laser-
scanning microscope FV-1000D or a Carl Zeiss inverted microscope 
Axiovert 200 equipped with a CoolSNAP cf charge-coupled device 
camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) operated with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Openlab</rs> software

with <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software. </p>

<p>In order to reduce number of variables and get more 
reliable indicators, principal component analysis fol-
lowed by the exploratory factor analysis with varimax 
rotation was completed for the variables describing 
different aspects of manufacturing strategies and op-
erations. Some of the original variables were excluded 
from the analysis due to the bad fi t with the result-
ing factor model. In the fi nal model 3 factors explain 
66.6% of the total variance of 31 initial variables (see 
Appendix 2). The subscales for each factor were com-
puted by the aid of the regression algorithm built into 
the factor analysis tool in the <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> software. The in-
ternal reliability of our three subscales was confi rmed 
by theoretical fi t and also by the fact that the factor 
loadings of every initial variable were very high for 
one factor and relatively high proportion of the initial 
variance is described by the model. </p>

<p>Tryptic peptide mapping by RP-HPLC-MS/MS 
An aliquot of 190 mL 8M guanidine hydrochloride/0.4 M tris 
(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (TRIS-HCl), pH 
8.0 was added to 50 mg protein in 50 mL formulation buffer and 
incubated for 1 h at 37 
C with 20 mL 0.24 M dithiothreitol 
(DTT). Subsequently the mixture was incubated with 20 mL 
0.6 M iodoacetic acid for 0.25 h at room temperature in the dark. 
Reaction was quenched by addition of 30 mL 0.24 M DTT. The 
sample was transferred into 482 mL 50 mM TRIS-HCl by buffer 
exchange on a Sephadex G25 column. For tryptic digests, 13.4 mL 
trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) (0.25 mg/mL trypsin in 
50 mM TRIS-HCl) were added. The addition of trypsin was 
repeated after 2.5 h, the total incubation time was 5 h at 37 
C 
and the final mAb1/trypsin ratio »36:1 (w/w). For quenching, 
20 mL 10% formic acid were added. The sample was centrifuged at 
9,000 g for 5 min. An ACQUITY nanoUPLC (Waters) running 
in "high flow mode" followed by a Triversa Nanomate nanoESI-
source (Advion) and coupled with a LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo) was 
used for sample analysis. Four ml of sample were loaded onto a 
ACQUITY UPLC column (BEH300 C18, 1.0 £ 150 mm, 
1.7 mm) using a flow rate of 60 ml/min, a column temperature of 
50 
C and a gradient of 1 to 40% eluent B (0.1% formic acid/ace-
tonitrile) in 130 min (eluent A: 0.1% formic acid). Data analysis 
was performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">XCalibur</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Thermo.</rs>). The extent 
of oxidation of a peptide was estimated in a relative manner to the

C to allow complex formation due to biotin-streptavidin 
interactions. Complexes are magnetically captured on an 
electrode and a chemiluminescent signal generated using the 
co-reactant tripropylamine (TPA) was measured by a photomul-
tiplier detector. All serum samples and positive or negative con-
trol samples were analyzed in replicates and calibrated against 
reference standard.

AUC (0-672 h) was calculated by linear trapezoidal rule (with lin-
ear interpolation) from time 0 to infinity. The apparent terminal 
half-life (t 1/2 ) was derived from the equation: t 1/2 D ln2 / lz. 
Total body clearance (CL) was calculated as Dose/AUC. Statisti-
cally significant differences in the PK parameters between different 
mAb1 preparations were determined by ANOVA analysis. </p>

trast medium was determined by counting the number of 
vertebral body units through a 16-detector low CT scanner

particular point are observed in the sequence, only 
when the lower-intensity peak accounted for more

<p>Background: Prostate artery embolization (PAE) is emerging and is a promising minimally 
invasive therapy that improves lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH). The purpose of this article was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PAE 
on LUTS related to BPH. 
Materials and methods: A literature review was performed to identify all published articles 
of PAE for BPH. The sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library from 1980 
to 2016. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The outcome measurements 
were combined by calculating the mean difference with 95% confidence interval. Statistical 
analysis was carried out using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Review Manager</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.3.0.</rs>. 
Results: Twelve studies involving 840 participants were included. Compared with baseline, 
the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5; International Prostate Symptom Score) 
scores, the quality of life scores, peak urinary flow rate (Q max ) and postvoid residual volume all 
had significant improvements during the 24-month follow-up (all P,0.00001). Both prostate 
volume (PV) and prostate-specific antigen had significant decrease during the 12-month 
follow-up (P,0.00001 and P=0.005, respectively), except postoperative 24 months (P=0.47 
and P=0.32, respectively). The IIEF-5 short form scores had significant increase at postopera-
tive 6 months (P=0.002) and 12 months (P,0.0001), except postoperative 1 month (P=0.23) 
and 24 months (P=0.21). For large volume (PV $80 mL) BPH, the results were similar. There 
were no life-threatening complications. 
Conclusion: PAE is an effective, safe and well-tolerable treatment for LUTS related to BPH, 
including large volume (PV $80 mL) BPH, with a good short-term follow-up. Studies with 
large number of cases and longer follow-up time are needed to validate our results. 
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are main complaints resulting from benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is one of the most common diseases of aging men. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis was carried out using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Review Manager</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5.3.0.</rs>. The changes in seven functional indexes were deter-
mined as differences between baseline and study completion. 
Outcome measurements were combined by calculating the 
mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI). To 
quantify the effect of heterogeneity test result, I 
2 heteroge-
neity test was used. A random-effects model was used if 
I 
2 value was .50%; if not, a fixed-effects model was used. 
Publication bias was evaluated using the funnel plot. </p>

<p>The mRNA levels of GRP94 were detected via reverse-tran-
scriptase polymerase chain reaction. Liver tissues were removed from 
the À808C refrigerator and crushed. Total RNA was extracted using 
Trizol reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the amount and purification were 
evaluated with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. 
A total of 1 mg RNA was used to synthesize complementary 
DNA using a Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). 
PCR primers were designed using Primer 5.0 software, compared 
with the GenBank database for identification, and synthesized by 
Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). PCR amplification was per-
formed on the GRP94 gene upstream primer (5 
0 -AGGAAACACTC 
TGGGACG-3

0 -ATTCAGGTACTT 
AGGCATC-3 
0 ), producing an amplified fragment of 583 bp. 
Amplification of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase

reaction included 200 mmol/L dNTP, 2 U Taq DNA polymerase, 
0.2 mmol/L of each of the upstream and downstream primers, 5 mL 
template complementary DNA, and ddH 2 O to reach a total volume 
of 50 mL. Reaction conditions were predenaturation at 948C for 
10 minutes; denaturation at 948C for 45 seconds, annealing at 558C 
for 30 seconds, and extension at 728C for 30 seconds, for a total of 
35 cycles; and extension at 728C for 7 minutes. 
After electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel, ethidium 
bromide-stained bands were visualized by ultraviolet transillumi-
nation, and the fluorescence intensity was semiquantified using a

Immunostaining was carried out with a streptavidin-peroxidase 
kit obtained from Suzhou Enmaike Bio-Tech (Suzhou, China) in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Three nonoverlap-
ping fields were randomly selected under Â400 magnification. 
The cells positively stained with anti-GRP94 primary anti-
body appeared with brown-yellow granules in the cytoplasm of 
hepatocytes. The intensity of immunohistochemical staining was 
analyzed using <rs type="software">Image-Pro-Plus</rs> image analysis software. An aver-
age gray value supplied by the software was used to reference the 
intensity of GRP94 staining (ie, normalized to an internal control). </p>

<rs type="software">compute.es</rs> package in R. Analysis of KBW in mutants fed NIH31 or 
NIH37 was done using Student's t test. Real time PCR data was analyzed 
fitting an anova model including within subject error. Fatty acid 
oxidation assay results for five technical (well) replicates were averaged 
for each cell line and genotype. The corresponding five pairs of means 
were analyzed using paired t-test. </p>

<p>Raw Illumina gene expression data were processed using variance 
stabilization and quantile normalization with the lumi package (Du

probes with detection call p value b0.05 in at least seven of the arrays, 
followed by batch-removal using COMBAT (Johnson et al., 2007). 
Same-gene probes were consolidated to a single identifier keeping the 
probe with highest mean value. Detection of differentially expressed 
genes was performed using linear models and empirical Bayes methods 
implemented in the limma package (Smyth, 2004) in R. For time course 
analysis, <rs type="software">splines</rs> and <rs type="software">limma</rs> packages in R were used to fit separate 
curves in mutant males and females for each gene, and then the param-

<p>Weighted Gene Co-expression Network and Pathway Analysis was 
performed using the <rs type="software">WGCNA</rs> R package (Langfelder and Horvath, 
2008) with soft thresholding powers selected based on the approximate 
scale-free topology criterion (Zhang and Horvath, 2005), followed by 
blockwise network construction, module detection, correlation with 
sex/genotype and comparative network analysis to determine module 
preservation. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the identified 
modules and lists of differentially expressed genes was performed in R 
using GOstats (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007). </p>

<p>Kidney samples were submitted to the West Coast Metabolomics 
Center, at University of California, Davis, and processed according to 
the facility's protocols. Briefly, lipidomics workflow involves sample 
extraction in MTBE with addition of internal standards, followed by 
ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) on a Waters CSH 
column, interfaced to a QTOF mass spectrometer (performed using an 
Agilent 1290 Infinity LC system (G4220A binary pump, G4226A 
autosampler, and G1316C Column Thermostat) coupled to either an 
Agilent 6530 (positive ion mode) or an Agilent 6550 mass spectrometer 
equipped with an ion funnel (iFunnel) (negative ion mode)), with a 
15 min total run time. Data were collected in both positive and negative 
ion mode, and analyzed using <rs id="software-25" type="software">MassHunter</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-25" type="creator">Agilent</rs>) to assign a unique 
ID to each lipid based on its retention time and exact mass (RT_mz). For 
GC-TOF, samples were prepared and analyzed using Gerstel CIS4 -with 
dual MPS Injector, Agilent 6890 GC and Pegasus III TOF MS, as described 
in (Fiehn et al., 2008). 
Analysis was performed in R (Team, 2014). Data were log2-
transformed and centered using Pareto scaling (van den Berg et al., 
2006). Exploratory data analysis was conducted using principal compo-
nent analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to identify 
metabolites that were normally distributed, which were then analyzed 
for differential detection using linear models and empirical Bayes 
methods (Smyth, 2004). Non-normally distributed metabolites were 
analyzed using Wilcoxon test, followed by fdr-correction of p-values. 
Metabolites with 2 fold increase/decrease and adjusted p-value b 0.05 
were considered differentially expressed. </p>

<p>21 This h -index adjustment is suggested by Kaur, Radicchi, and Menczer (2013) and it is used by the online citation 
analysis tool <rs id="software-0" type="software">Scholarometer</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://scholarometer.indiana.edu</rs>), whose popularity for computing and comparing 
the h -indices of scholars across disciplines seems to be growing.

ogists' h

<p>We conclude by providing the details of the two empirical exercises described 
in the introduction. 
23 In both exercises we rely on a dataset constructed by Glen 
Ellison who graciously made it available to us. Ellison (2013, p. 68) describes his 
data as follows: "The dataset includes citation records of almost all faculty at the 
top 50 economics departments in the 1995 NRC ranking. Faculty lists were taken 
from the departmental websites in the fall of 2011. Citation data for each economist 
were collected from <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>. Economists were classified into one or more of 
15 subfields primarily by mapping keywords appearing in descriptions of research 
interests on departmental or individual websites. Slightly less than one-half of econ-
omists are classified as working in a single field." 
When one looks, even casually, at Ellison's citation data, one cannot help but 
notice the large differences in the average numbers of citations across fields, from 
a high of 108 per paper in international trade to a low of 30 per paper in economic 
history. To correct for these differences when comparing scholars from different 
fields, one must first rescale the individual citation lists, as explained in Section III, 
by dividing each scholars' citations, paper by paper, by the average number of cita-
tions in that paper's field. For scholars whose papers are in a single field, all citations 
should be divided by the average number of citations in that field. 
Our first exercise illustrates that use of the h -index can lead to serious practical 
problems when efforts are made to correct for differences in fields of study because 
rescaling has a nontrivial effect on the h -index's within-field rankings. In this exer-
cise we restricted attention to individuals in Ellison's (2013) data who are classified 
as working in a single field. For the 88 individuals who are classified as macroecon-
omists, the average number of citations per paper is 97.9, while the average number 
of citations per paper for the 64 IO economists is 55.17. Therefore, to adequately 
compare macroeconomists to IO economists one must scale down the macroecono-
mists' citation lists by a factor of (97.9)/(55.17) = 1.77. 
Figure 3 shows that the h -index's within-field ranking of macroeconomists is 
nontrivially affected by this rescaling. Each numbered space on the horizontal axis 
corresponds to a macroeconomist, with space k denoting the macroeconomist with 
the k th highest h -index before rescaling. The heights of the bars indicate either the 
total number of ranking changes (lighter colored bars) or the number of strict rank-
ing reversals (darker colored bars) experienced by each macroeconomist as a result 
of rescaling. 
For example, after rescaling all of the macroeconomists' lists, macroecono-
mist number 47 experiences 8 within-field strict ranking reversals and a total of 13 
within-field ranking changes. That is, there are 8 macroeconomists (the height of the 
darker colored bar) who either have a strictly higher h -index than macroeconomist 
47 before rescaling but a strictly lower h -index after or vice versa; and there are 5 
additional macroeconomists (for a total of 13, the height of the lighter colored bar) 
who either have the same h -index as macroeconomist 47 before rescaling but a dif-
ferent h -index after or vice versa. </p>

<p>to the normal liver parenchyma, yielding decreased signal 
intensity and inhomogeneous enhancement during the HB 
phase. In previous studies, the histogram in HB phase was 
well correlated with liver fibrosis grade and this notion was 
supported by the fact that heterogeneity in HB phase may 
be correlated with liver fibrosis grade (16-19). 
We hypothesized that we could suspect the degree of liver 
fibrosis by calculating liver enhancement heterogeneity 
in the HB phase, and accordingly, developed new <rs id="software-0" type="software">MATLAB</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">R2012a</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">MathWorks</rs>, Natick, MA, USA)-based software to 
identify inhomogeneous signal intensities calculated from 
a coefficient of variation (CV) map to objectively quantify 
liver parenchymal heterogeneity. 
In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the heterogeneity of 
liver parenchyma on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR images, 
using CV value processed by our <rs type="software">MATLAB-based software</rs>, 
and to demonstrate a correlation between the calculated 
heterogeneity and the calculated serologic markers including 
APRI and FIB-4, which have been known to have diagnostic 
accuracy for predicting hepatic fibrosis in CHB patients. </p>

<p>Imaging Analysis and Measurement of Hepatic Fibrosis 
To measure hepatic fibrosis quantitatively, we developed 
a <rs id="software-4" type="software">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">R2012a</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">MathWorks</rs>, Natick, MA, USA)-based 
software to calculate a CV map, as suggested by Li et al. 
(21). The following procedure was used to calculate the CV 
map: bias correction of intensity inhomogeneity, followed 
by calculation of the CV map by dividing the CV value by 
each pixel value in the circular region of interest (ROI; 
diameter = 40 pixels) and, finally, calculating the mean 
value on the CV map (Fig. 1). </p>

<p>Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced axial images obtained during the 
HB phase MR image were obtained in Digital Imaging and 
Communications in Medicine format and stored on console 
containing the <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs>-based program. For quantitative 
measurements of liver parenchymal heterogeneity, two 
abdominal radiologists (with 24 years of experience and 
with 4 years of experience in abdominal imaging), blinded 
to clinical information and pathological fibrosis grades, 
performed the procedure by positioning separate circular 
ROIs (diameter = 40 pixels) on the selected MR images, 
which was bias-corrected. In all subjects, ROIs were placed 
on the anterior segment of the right hepatic lobe with no 
overlap over large vessels and focal lesions such as cysts or 
tumors (Fig. 2). Each radiologist measured ROIs 3 times in 
the selected MR images and calculated the mean. </p>

with MedCalc version 15.6 (MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium). </p>

<p>Study population. The study population was obtained from the November 2012 
records of the SEER program of the National Cancer Institute. The SEER database is a 
large population-based dataset from North America. It covers approximately 28% of 
the US population and the characteristics of the SEER population are comparable 
with the general US population, which overcomes the selection bias that commonly 
exists in published studies. Furthermore, the large size of the database guarantees the 
statistical power to detect the sex effect. 
To retrieve subjects from the SEER database, the following criteria were entered in 
the selection statement of <rs type="software">SEER*stat software</rs>: histologically confirmed RCC, 
excluding cancers diagnosed at autopsy or by death certificate only, RCC recorded as 
a first primary malignancy, follow-up months more than 0, diagnosed time-frame 
from 1998 to 2010, and ages 18-90. Of the 125,793 listed cases, we further excluded 
patients with a tumor size equal to 0 or larger than 30 cm (n 5 9558) and SEER 
historic stage unknown (n 5 1696). The study cohort consisted of 114,539 patients 
with RCC. </p>

for comparison between two groups. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. A value of

<p>methods. The analysis also provides a comparison of the determinants of FDI and 
trade flows within the same framework. We gather data on bilateral trade flows 
from the dataset connected with Rose and Spiegel (2011) and made available on-
line by Andrew Rose at faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/arose/RecRes.htm#Software. 
Specifically, the data are CIF imports measured in US$, taken from Interna-

son purposes, we sample the year 2000 for the same observations we use for our 
cross-border M&amp;A results, which yielded the largest sample size out of all the 
FDI measures.

as well as repeats the cross-border M&amp;A inclusion probabilities for comparison </p>

<p>The most crucial steps to successfully sort ISCs from young and old guts are the appropriate initial settings of the FACS and gating parameters 
using the described controls and following a specific sorting hierarchy. We performed the FAC sorting on an ARIA II Flow Cytometer (<rs type="software">FACSDiva</rs> 
software). It is important that the instrument is turned on at least one hour prior to sorting to warm up the lasers. Of note, when FAC sorting

<p>Identification of FRIGIDA homologues in B. napus 
The genomic, cDNA and protein sequences of A. thaliana FRI 
(At4g00650) were used as queries for BLASTN and TBLASTN 
homology searches of the nt/nr and EST sections of GenBank (as 
of 27 November 2005), which identified a B. napus EST (GenBank 
accession number CD836567, derived from B. napus cv. Jet Neuf) 
with 74% sequence identity over 578 bp of FRI exon 1. A genomic 
fragment corresponding to the EST was amplified from B. napus 
cv. Express genomic DNA using an EST sequence-derived primer 
pair (A102-A103; see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). The 
PCR product of 614 bp had 99% sequence identity to the EST and 
was used as probe to screen a B. napus cv. Express BAC library 
(obtained from Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fü r Genomfor-
schung GmbH (RZPD), Berlin, Germany) according to standard 
protocols for radioactive hybridization (Sambrook et al., 1989). 
DNA of positive BAC clones was extracted using the 
NucleoBondÒ PC 500 plasmid DNA purification kit (Macherey &amp; 
Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Dü ren, Germany). Sequence identity or 
homology to the probe fragment was confirmed by PCR amplifi-
cation and sequencing of BAC DNA using primer pair A102-
A103. The BAC clones were grouped into three sequence groups 
according to a multiple sequence alignment using the AlignX 
module of the Vector NTI software package (Invitrogen Corpora-
tion, Carlsbad, USA). To identify the full-length genomic sequen-
ces, one BAC of each group was selected for primer walking using 
primers A127, A133, A201, A248, A249, A250, A260, A261, A262, 
A372, and A378 (see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). The 
genes were annotated using pairwise sequence alignments 
(<rs id="software-25" type="software">BLAST2</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-25" type="url">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</rs>) with FRI and the <rs id="software-26" type="software">FGE-
NESH+</rs> and FGENESH_C gene prediction programs (<rs corresp="#software-26" type="url">http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml</rs>). Orthology was inferred by 
bidirectional best hit analysis (Overbeek et al., 1999) using 
the B. napus genes as queries for BLASTX searches against 
the A. thaliana protein database at TAIR (http://www. 
arabidopsis.org). Following the nomenclature for Brassica genes 
(Ostergaard and King, 2008), the three FRI homologues were 
designated as BnaA.FRI.a, BnaX.FRI.b, and BnaX.FRI.c. 
A primer pair derived from the exon 3 region of the B. napus genes 
(A249-A374), was used for PCR amplification from B. napus cv. 
Express genomic DNA. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-
T vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA) according to the 
manufacturer's protocol. Twenty positive clones were selected and 
sequenced. A multiple sequence alignment identified four sequence 
groups, three of which corresponded to BnaA.FRI.a, BnaX.FRI.b, 
and BnaX.FRI.c. The fourth sequence was designated as BnaX.-
FRI.d. BnaX.FRI.d-specific primers N010 and A156 were designed 
(see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). By using primer A102 
in combination with the BnaX.FRI.d-specific primer N010, and 
primer A157 together with the BnaX.FRI.d-specific primer A156, the 
5' and 3' regions of BnaX.FRI.d were obtained. The sequences of 
BnaA.FRI.a, BnaX.FRI.b, BnaX.FRI.c, and BnaX.FRI.d were 
deposited at GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank). </p>

<p>for the Tapidor allele and was used in combination with A385 to 
genotype all 202 DH lines by PCR amplification. Genotypes were 
scored according to the presence or absence of the target fragment 
after agarose gel electrophoresis. 
BnaA.FRI.a was mapped onto the framework map constructed 
by Long et al. (2007) using JoinMap <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">3.0</rs> (Van Ooijen and 
Voorrips, 2001) and a LOD score of 2.5. The resulting genetic 
map and the flowering time data for 11 environments recorded by 
Long et al. (2007) were used for detection of QTL for flowering 
time by composite interval mapping (CIM) with Windows QTL 
cartographer <rs corresp="#software-31" type="version-number">2.5</rs> (Wang et al., 2011). </p>

<p>SNP detection and inference of haplotypes in a collection of 
B. napus accessions 
According to the flowering time data of 248 accessions from two 
growth seasons (see Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online), 
a subset of 95 accessions including similar numbers of early, 
intermediate, and late flowering accessions were selected for a first 
genotypic analysis. The BnaA.FRI.a-specific primer combinations 
N036-A385 and N053-N020 were used to genotype these acces-
sions by PCR amplification and sequencing. Two primers (N018 
and A385) were used for sequencing the N036-A385 PCR 
products, and three primers (N020, N054, and N057) were used 
for sequencing the N053-N020 products. Whole gene sequences 
were obtained by assembling the sequence data from these 
sequencing reactions for each accession. Sequences were aligned 
using <rs id="software-9" type="software">VectorNTI</rs> <rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">10.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Invitrogen Corporation</rs>, Carlsbad, USA) or 
<rs id="software-10" type="software">CLC main workbench</rs> <rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">CLC bio</rs>, Aarhus, Denmark), and 
alignments were edited manually using the <rs id="software-11" type="software">BioEdit</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-11" type="url">http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html</rs>). Haplotypes were 
inferred using the <rs id="software-35" type="software">software HAP</rs> at default parameters (<rs corresp="#software-35" type="url">http://research.calit2.net/hap</rs>). Three primers (N069, N076, and N078; 
see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online) were designed to 
differentiate between the two nucleotides for each of the three 
haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) detected by HAP in haplotype 
block 2. All 248 accessions were genotyped at these htSNP 
positions by PCR with primer combinations N069-N020, N053-
N076, and N053-N078. Haplotypes were scored according to the 
presence or absence of the respective bands after agarose gel 
electrophoresis of the PCR products (see Supplementary Table S1 
at JXB online). </p>

<p>Population structure evaluation 
28 publicly available SSR markers (see Supplementary Table S3 at 
JXB online) were selected from Cheng et al. (2009) which were 
distributed equally across the genetic map of B. napus. To reduce 
costs, an M13-tailing PCR technique was used (Schuelke, 2000). 
For each SSR primer combination, the forward sequence of the 
M13 primer was added to the 5# end of the forward SSR primer 
and the reverse sequence of the M13 primer was added to the 
5' end of the reverse SSR primer. PCR reactions were performed 
with four primers, the M13F-forward SSR primer, the M13R-
reverse SSR primer, an IRD700-labelled M13F primer (MWG 
Operon, Ebersberg, Germany) and an unlabelled M13R primer. 
The 28 SSR markers were used to assay the 95 accessions which 
were selected for the first round of genotyping. The DNA analyser 
system Li-Cor 4300 (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) 
was used for electrophoresis and detection of PCR products. The 
presence or absence of PCR product bands was scored as 1 or 0, 
respectively. The software <rs id="software-13" type="software">STRUCTURE</rs> <rs corresp="#software-13" type="version-number">2.2.3</rs> was used to 
estimate population structure (<rs corresp="#software-13" type="url">http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html</rs>) (Pritchard et al., 2000). K values ranging from 1 to 
10 were tested with a burn-in of 100 000 iterations and 100 000 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations according to the 
software's instructions. 
The effect of population structure on flowering time was tested 
using <rs id="software-39" type="software">SAS</rs> GLM (<rs corresp="#software-39" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The </p>

<p>Linkage-disequilibrium and association analysis 
<rs id="software-15" type="software">TASSEL</rs> <rs corresp="#software-15" type="version-number">2.01</rs> was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium (LD) 
based on the parameter R 
2 (Bradbury et al., 2007). Only SNPs 
with frequencies larger than 0.05 were included for LD calculation. 
To avoid redundancy, each InDel was considered as a single 
polymorphic site. 
For SNP/InDel-based association analysis, a structure-based 
model which takes population structure into account to reduce 
spurious associations was used. Associations between markers and 
the total trait variation were tested using a general linear model 
(GLM) which was implemented in <rs id="software-16" type="software">TASSEL</rs> <rs corresp="#software-16" type="version-number">2.01</rs>. A Q matrix 
which was obtained with <rs id="software-17" type="software">STRUCTURE</rs> <rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-number">2.2.3</rs> was used to account 
for population structure. The null hypothesis of this study was that 
the occurrence of polymorphisms in BnaA.FRI.a is independent of 
the variation in flowering time, whereas the alternative hypothesis 
was that polymorphisms are associated with flowering time 
variation. Only polymorphisms with frequencies above 0.05 were 
included and 1000 permutations were performed. An adjusted 
P value &lt;0.05 was considered as a criterion for association. For 
haplotype association analysis, block 1 and block 2 were regarded 
as two polymorphic loci. Different haplotypes in the same block 
were regarded as allelic variants at one locus. For further analysis 
of association between haplotype and flowering time variation in 
a larger panel which included 248 accessions, the software <rs id="software-18" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-18" type="version-number">9.0</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-18" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used to conduct 
an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multi-comparison analyses 
with least significant differences (LSD). </p>

<p>Because a strong population structure was observed and 
a large percentage of the observed phenotypic variation could 
be explained by population structure, association analysis 
may identify spurious associations. Therefore, a structure-
based association analysis was performed. This analysis 
revealed an association of SNP1790 with flowering time 
variation in 2008, and an association of SNP198, SNP254, 
SNP324, SNP348, and SNP417 with flowering time variation 
in 2009 (P &lt;0.05; Table 2). All of these six SNPs were 
located within exons, including five (SNP198, SNP254, 
SNP324, SNP348, and SNP417) in exon 1 and one 
(SNP1790) in exon 3 (Fig. 4B). Two of these SNPs, SNP254 
and SNP1790, are predicted to result in amino acid changes. 
As there was no SNP with significant association to 
flowering time in both years, a haplotype-based association 
analysis was performed. Using the software <rs id="software-23" type="software">HAP</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-23" type="url">http://research.calit2.net/hap</rs>) to infer haplotypes for BnaA.FRI.a 
among all accessions, two haplotype blocks were found within 
this gene. 27 SNPs or InDels were located in block 1 (position 
-140 to 1223, including exon 1) and 13 SNPs or InDels in 
block 2 (position 1224 to 2182, including exons 2 and 3). 
Three common haplotypes (represented by more than two 
accessions each) were identified in block 1, while four common 
haplotypes were found in block 2. Three polymorphic sites </p>

<p>and 4. However, the two haplotypes differ at two positions 
at the nucleotide sequence level, i.e. the htSNP at position 
1615 and the SNP at position 1702, which are both located 
within the coding sequence. In addition to the SNPs 
observed between haplotypes 3 and 4, the two alleles in the 
TNDH population carry multiple additional polymor-
phisms, including several SNPs and a 3 bp indel in the 
promoter region, two indels in the 5# UTR and six non-
synonymous SNPs in exon 1 (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at 
JXB online). Among the six non-synonymous SNPs, two 
are located within the Frigida domain, but not at positions 
which are conserved among FRI family I proteins in 
A. thaliana and other rosid species (Risk et al., 2010), and 
two are located in the non-conserved region between the 
Frigida domain and the N-terminal putative coiled-coil 
domain. The remaining two non-synonymous SNPs are 
located within the N-terminal putative coiled-coil domain. 
One of these SNPs (SNP254) results in the substitution of 
a charged residue (glutamate) by an uncharged amino acid 
(glycine). Charged residues are present at high percentages 
in coiled-coil domains and are thought to stabilize the 
domain through electrostatic interactions (McFarlane et al., 
2009). Interestingly, a glutamate to glycine substitution in 
the winter type allele in Tapidor (in an otherwise un-
changed, theoretical molecule) would reduce the probability 
of a coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal region from 
;50% to &lt;5%, and the probability of a coiled-coil domain 
in the semi-winter type allele in Ningyou7 is also low 
(&lt;10%; predictions according to <rs id="software-55" type="software">COILS</rs> for a window size 
of 28 residues; <rs corresp="#software-55" type="url">http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/coils/COILS_doc.html</rs>; data not shown). The glutamate residue 
is conserved between A. thaliana and the Tapidor allele and 
corresponds to the position with the most significant 
P value for SNP-trait association within the entire gene 
(0.005 in 2009; Table 2). Furthermore, it was recently 
demonstrated that the N-terminal region including the 
coiled-coil domain of FRI in A. thaliana is required for 
protein-protein interaction with FRL1 as part of a tran-
scriptional activator complex which establishes an active 
chromatin state of FLC (Choi et al., 2011). It is conceivable 
that the polymorphism within the N-terminal coiled-coil 
domain in BnaA.FRI.a contributes to functional differences 
between the segregating alleles in the TNDH population 
and may also play a part in natural variation at least in 
some environments. 
The relatively high number of polymorphisms in exon 1 
compared with the number of SNPs in exons 2 and 3, which 
together are of comparable size to exon 1, between the 
parents of the mapping population as well as in our panel of 
natural accessions (Table 2) is consistent with data for A. 
thaliana, which indicate that exon 1 is hypervariable and 
may be under different selection constraints than exons 2 
and 3 (Le Corre et al., 2002). Interestingly, these regions 
largely coincide with the two haplotype blocks that were 
identified in BnaA.FRI.a, with one including exon 1 and the 
other including exons 2 and 3. The notion of a hypervariable 
region and the existence of two haplotype blocks in 
BnaA.FRI.a is consistent with the observed rapid decay of </p>

<p>ation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. 
Statistical analyses were performed with a two-tailed Stu-
dent's t test. Significant differences were assigned P values 
of &lt; 0.05, &lt; 0.01, and &lt; 0.001, which were denoted by *, **, 
and ***, respectively. All statistical values were calculated 
with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">19.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs>, USA). </p>

<p>mapping rate. Raw data were first mapped to the Drosophila mela-
nogaster transcriptome (FlyBase r5.57 release) using the '-G' parame-
ter with other parameters set as default. The read pairs that were not 
completely mapped were then aligned to the D. melanogaster ge-
nome (dm3) for a second run. Only the uniquely aligned and concor-
dant read pairs were used for further analysis. We used <rs id="software-4" type="software">Cufflinks</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">v2.2.1</rs> with parameters set as default except using '-G' parameter to

<p>To identify conserved translated sORFs, we utilized two annotated 
datasets to estimate the PhyloCSF threshold, comparing with 11 
other Drosophila species: (i) the positive dataset was the annotated 
sORFs in FlyBase; and (ii) the negative dataset was all the sORFs 
contained in annotated lincRNAs based on the assumption that all 
of these sORFs are non-translated. From the histogram of the 
PhyloCSF score distribution in each set, we found an optimal 
PhyloCSF score of 50 which could discriminate annotated sORFs 
from untranslated sORFs (Supplementary Fig. S3). We then used the 
PhyloCSF package to evaluate the coding potential of ORFs con-
tained in ribosome-associated lncRNAs and novel transcripts with 
parameters '12flies -orf ¼ ATGStop -frames ¼ 3 -minCodons ¼ 10', 
which was intended to find all ORFs longer than 10-aa in frame. To 
avoid any influence of annotated ORFs, we excluded the ORFs 
which overlapped with annotated ORFs in the same or opposite 
strand. The multi-alignment file of 12 flies species were downloaded 
from the <rs type="software">Galaxy</rs> cloud tool. </p>

<p>were taken on the same day for the determination of both 
FPG and HbA1c. The study group was selected from patient 
samples that had hemoglobin levels between 12 and 
16 g/dL because HbA1c results can be influenced by 
several factors, including anemia. In addition, samples from 
patients with hemoglobin abnormalities or uremia or who 
were pregnant were excluded. The estimated glucose levels 
(mg/dL) were calculated using the following formula: 28.7 x 
HbA1c -46.7. 
6 According to the patients' levels of blood 
glucose control, we divided the samples into three groups: 
group A: FPG , 126 mg/dL; group B: FPG = 126-200 mg/ 
dL; and group C: FPG . 200 mg/dL. Glucose levels were 
determined using the hexokinase method in an Olympus 
2700 analyzer with commercially available Olympus kits 
(Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Shizuoka-ken, Japan). HbA1c 
levels were determined using an HPLC method and an 
Agilent Technologies 1200 Series analyzer with commer-
cially available kits (Chromsystems Instruments and 
Chemicals GmbH, Mü nchen, Germany). Hemoglobin (Hb) 
levels were determined using a Beckman Coulter Gen S 
system (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). 
All statistical analyses were performed using the 
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 11</rs>.0 
for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA). Data were expressed as 
the means ¡ standart error of the mean (SEM). A p-value 
,0.05 was accepted as significant. The Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test was performed to assess the normality of the 
variables. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to 
compare the FPG and eAG levels, and the Mann-Whitney 
U test was used to compare the variables between males 
and females. The Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was 
used to test the relationship between the FPG and eAG 
levels. </p>

<p>) tests of association were used to explore relationships 
between the outcome variables and setting. 
Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess whether there was an 
independent effect of setting on feelings of control over daily life, 
controlling for the effects of background variables as necessary. The 
statistical analyses were undertaken using the PASW Statistics , release

<p>Bioinformatics analysis. Protein structures of the TTLL12 wild-
type and new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform were predicted by 
bioinformatics softwares. The mRNA CDS and AA sequence 
of wild-type TTLL12 were gained in NCBI (http://www.ncbi. 
nlm.nih.gov/blast). In addition, the new transcript of TTLL12 
was translated into a new AA sequence using <rs type="software">DNAStar 
EditSeq</rs>. Then, the AA sequence of the new TTLL12 36AA 
plus isoform was aligned with the wild-type by NCBI protein 
blast (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Physicochemical proper-
ties of the wild-type and new isoform were predicted by online 
tools <rs id="software-2" type="software">ProtParam</rs> and <rs type="software">ProtScale</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://www.expasy.ch/tools/protscale.html</rs>), respectively. Secondary structures of the 
wild-type and new isoform AA sequences were predicted by 
DNAStar Protean and online tool <rs id="software-4" type="software">CFSSP</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">http://www.biogem.org/tool/chou-fasman</rs>/). To further investigate the function of 
the new isoform of the TTLL12 transcript, we also used the 
online prediction tool <rs id="software-5" type="software">DisPort search</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.disport.org/search.php</rs>) to predict whether the additional 36 AA sequence 
is in a disordered region of TTLL12. </p>

<p>Physicochemical properties of the TTLL12 wild-type and 
new 36AA plus isoform. The AA sequence of the TTLL12 
36AA plus isoform was obtained using DNAStar EditSeq 
and translating the DNA sequences. Then, the AA sequence 
of the new isoform was aligned with the TTLL12 wild-type, 
and we found an additional 36AA inserted at the location of 
281AA of the TTLL12 wild-type (Fig. 5A). Next, we predicted 
the physicochemical properties by <rs type="software">ProtParam</rs> and <rs type="software">ProtScale</rs>. 
The properties of TTLL12 wild-type and 36AA plus isoform 
AA sequences were predicted (Table I) as follows: the total

respectively. </p>

of TTLL12 was highly aligned with the disordered region of Bcl-2-like protein 11 (B2L11). (B) The additional 36AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was

dence interval. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to as-
sess variation of GMTs among groups for each time point; 
multiple comparison tests were based on Turkey's method. 
Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square test 
(Fisher's exact test for less than 30 samples). Statistical signifi-

<p>Cells were analyzed for EGFP and BFP expression by flow cytome-

<p>Sampling continued until saturation with regard to 
the contextual factors was reached. Each transcript 
was then thoroughly reviewed by the first author to 
reveal common themes. These themes were coded 
using <rs type="software">NVivo</rs> qualitative analysis software. Some of 
the themes were directly related to the interview 
questions and others emerged from the interviews. 
The richness of the diversity of factors raised by 
respondents and their concurrence about the impor-
tance of these factors prompted a return to the 
literature to further assess the salience of these is-
sues. It also led directly to thinking about how to 
place the diversity of factors into a coherent frame-
work that would be helpful to policymakers and 
health-care providers interested in developing suc-

either a χ 
2 periodogram or a linear regression line fit to the activity onsets. The 
data used for period measurements were based on animal behaviours in a 14-day 
interval taken 3 days after the start of DD condition. For the pulse-induced shift 
experiments, mice put in DD were exposed to a 15 min light pulse at either CT14 
or CT22. Phase shifts (delay at CT14, advance at CT22) were quantified as the 
time difference between regression lines of activity onset before and after the 
light application. </p>

<p>Per1-luc SCN slice culture. Per1-luc transgenic mice carry a firefly luciferase 
reporter gene linked to a 7.2 kb genomic DNA fragment covering the 5′ upstream 
region of the mouse Per1 gene 
59 . Per1-luc-Rgs16 
-/-mice were generated by crossing 
Per1-luc transgenic mice and Rgs16 
-/-mice. The SCN slices were prepared accord-
ing to our standard method 
6 and kept at 35 °C in a sealed 35 mm petri dish with 
1 ml of the culture medium containing 1 mM luciferin. The bioluminescence from 
the cultured SCN was measured with a highly sensitive cryogenic CCD camera 
(Spectra Video SV16KV/CT: Pixelvision) equipped with a microscope (Axiovert 
135TV: Carl Zeiss). Observed data of images were filtered through a median 
filter to eliminate cosmic-ray-induced background noise. The luminescence was 
recorded every 20 min. Periods of SCN luminescence recordings were estimated 
using Fast Fourier Transform-Nonlinear Least Squares analysis 
60 as part of the 
<rs type="software">Biological Rhythms Analysis Software System (BRASS</rs>). For all SCN to be com-
pared, identical segments of raw SCN luminescence values, starting from the first 
trough since the start of the measurement, and containing at least four complete

<p>Bioinformatics and ChIP assays. The <rs type="software">VISTA</rs> bioinformatics tool was 
used to determine conserved noncoding sequences. ChIP assays were per 
formed as described previously (Kang et al., 2011). CD4 + T cells (5 × 10 6 
naive per sample), cultured in the presence of 100 U/ml IL2, 1.5 µg/ml 
concanavalin A, and 10 nM RA for 4-5 d, were used for ChIP assays. DNA 
protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using 4 µg antiBATF (rabbit 
polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), antiRAR (rabbit polyclonal; Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-acetylhistone H4 antibodies (EMD 
Millipore). Realtime PCR detection using the primers described in Table S3 
was conducted with a 7500 Sequence Detection System using the SYBR 
green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). </p>

<p>Statistical analyses. Means with SEM are shown in most of the figures. 
Student's paired t test (two tailed) was used to determine the significance of 
differences between two groups. The weight change data in Figs. 8 and 10 
was examined with a repeated measures ANOVA (<rs id="software-1" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 9.2</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>.). Pvalues ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. </p>

<p>ficient. To detect multicollinearity between C-SIA score factors, 
step-wise linear regression analyses with multicollinearity tests 
were performed using variance inflation factors (VIF) analysis. 
A VIF &gt; 4 warranted further investigations while a VIF &gt; 10 was 
considered a sign of serious multicollinearity. Finally, a Bland 
Altman analysis and linear regression were used to assess the 
agreement between the C-SIA and SIA scores. 
Data are reported as medians (25th-75th percentiles). A P 
value of &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance 
for paired comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed with

All data collected for the activities of catalase, GPx, and 
SOD, TRA, the contents of TBARS, carbonyl, and

analysis of variance using the general linear model 
procedure of <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2011</rs>) program. As fixed factors, the 
effects of packaging system (VACP, MOMAP, VSP-
MOMAP, HOMAP, and VSP-HOMAP), storage time (d 1, 
7, and 14 or d 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14), and their interaction 
(packaging system×storage time) on all variables were 
evaluated in our study. Duncan's multiple range test was 
carried out to compare significant (p&lt;0.05) differences 
among mean values of variables in packaging systems 
within each storage time or in storage times within each 
packaging system, when significances of two main factors 
were presented. </p>

<p>resonance frequency is always kept at 9.4 GHz. The initial

Cavity design generally requires electromagnetic field-solver 
that solves Maxwell equations numerically for the specified 
boundary conditions. In the simulations, POISSON and 
SUPERFISH are used as the main solver programs in a collec-
tion of programs from LANL [18,33]. The solver is used to cal-
culate the static magnetic and electric fields and radio-frequency 
electromagnetic fields for either 2-D Cartesian coordinates or 
axially symmetric cylindrical coordinates. The code SUPER-
FISH is used to solve for axisymmetric TM0nl modes, for the 
field components Hphi, Er and Ez. The solution is obtained 
through solving Hemholtz equation using finite element method 
FEM over a triangular mesh subject to the proper boundary 
conditions and symmetries imposed [34]. 
Design algorithm shown in Fig. 6 is implemented in MAT-
LAB code, where an initial case is chosen corresponding to ten 
z positions of points with cavity curvature is described with 
spline curve (step 2). Then the spline interpolated curve is sam-
pled at 100 points, where those sampled points are considered 
connected with piecewise linear, approximating the cavity cur-
vature. This piece wise linear description is fed to <rs type="software">AUTO-
MESH</rs> program to generate mesh (step 3). The solution of 
lowest TM mode of the cavity is made at step 4 by calling 
SUPERFISH, and the obtained frequency in step 5 is used 
to scale the cavity dimensions to keep the resonance frequency 
at 9.4 GH (step 6). The corresponding scaling is reflected on 
the obtained cavity shunt impedance (step 7), where this value 
is fed to the optimizer algorithm to determine the new ten 
points positions. Then the process is repeated starting from 
step 2. 
The results of the effective shunt impedance per unit length 
for RF cavity in mega ohm per meter after N function evalu-
ations for both the proposed algorithm and NEWUOA are 
shown in Table 3. 
It is to be mentioned that starting from the same initial 
point, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is as best 
as NEWUOA. However, the advantage of the proposed 
algorithm is its easy implementation and accessibility for 
update and modification. </p>

mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM 
EGTA, 0.005 volume % Tween 20,

diluted in assay buffer. The concen-
tration range was 1 pM to 100 nM 
for GLP-1 and exendin-4. 
125 I-GLP-
1(7-36)-amide (2.2 Ci/mol) was 
dissolved in assay buffer and added

tion and radioligand were mixed in 
96-well 0.65-m filter plates (Milli-
pore) with either diluted GLP-1 or 
exendin-4 and incubated for 1 h at 
37°C. Subsequently, bound and 
unbound radioligands were sepa-
rated by vacuum filtration (Milli-
pore vacuum manifold). The filters 
were washed twice in 100 l of cold 
assay buffer and left to dry. Data 
were analyzed by nonlinear regres-

<p>The Restech pH probes were calibrated in pH 7 and pH 4 
buffer solutions according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
The probe is a 1.5 mm diameter oropharyngeal catheter with a 
wireless digital transmitter worn externally. The catheter employs 
a 3.2 mm teardrop-like tip that contains a colored light emitting 
diode (LED) to aid insertion and to allow visualization of the 
sensor for proper positioning. The standard catheter was placed 
in the oropharynx at the level of the uvula. Each volunteer was 
asked to wear the device for a 24-hour period and was encour-
aged to participate in normal daily activities. Each subject carried 
one transmitter/receiver that wirelessly sent data to a monitor 
worn by the subject. The monitor contains a digital memory card 
to record events such as meal times, position and chief complaint. 
Once the pH study was completed, the volunteer returned to 
have the catheter removed, and the data from the digital recorder 
were downloaded to a password-protected computer. Data were 
analyzed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">DataView</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 3</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">AEMC Instru-ments</rs>, Dover, NH, USA). The software generated a graphical 
tracing of the study events and also created a report of any reflux 
events. The data collected during meal times were excluded from 
analysis. It was considered as reflux event when the time of pH 
reaching to the lowest point was no more than 30 seconds. </p>

<p>2011) and there are some empirical observations that strongly imply the systematic 
employment of such strategies. This section will discuss a few examples from the ICT 
sector. 
Luksha (2008) recounts several cases of cooptation of organizational networks 
(supplier networks, user networks) by a dominant firm for its own purposes. His 
examples include Microsoft as the dominant player in the PC operating systems' 
segment forcing cooperation between the two major competitors in the PC processor 
segment (which is clearly tied to PC operating systems), Intel and AMD. Luksha also 
identifies firms that actively shape and coordinate their user networks, namely Sun 
(then the vendor of a wide array of IT products including <rs type="software">Java</rs>, <rs type="software">StarOffice</rs>, <rs type="software">MySQL</rs>, 
<rs type="software">Solaris</rs>), Google, and Intel. Luksha does not go into detail on this, but it is clear that this 
activity is targeted on entrenching and extending the dominant position and the usage 
shares of the various products. This can be done by bundling products (across tied 
segments), particularly, in case of firms that offer a wide variety of related products 
like Sun (at the time), Google, Apple, and Microsoft. It can also be accomplished 
by acquiring more well-connected users (say, university students and faculty) and 
perhaps by coercing the help of prominent institutions (say, by offering special deals 
to universities)-in fact, aggressive marketing to otherwise privileged user groups is 
rather common. The case of Sun's Java offers a prime example of a huge marketing </p>

<p>Mass spectrometry analysis of protein 
The MSC EV preparation described above was extracted 
with CTB to isolate the CTB-binding EVs as described 
below. The remaining EV preparation after CTB extrac-
tion was collected as CTB-depleted MSC EV. Proteins 
(250 mg) from each of the 2 fractions were analysed by 
LC-MS/MS. Briefly, the samples were reduced by DTT, 
alkylated with IAA, digested by trypsin and analysed 
with LC-MS/MS as described (10). For each sample, all 
MS/MS spectra of each of the 3 independent prepara-
tions were extracted by ProteomeDiscovere <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">1.4</rs> (Thermo 
Scientific, Bremen, Germany) and combined into a single 
mascot generic file by a hand-written program. Protein 
identification was achieved by searching the combined 
data against the Uniprot human protein database (down-
load 22 Jan 2014; 88479 sequences, 35079223 residues) 
via an in-house Mascot server (Version 2.4.1Matrix 
Science, UK). The search parameters were a maximum of 
2 missed cleavages using trypsin; fixed modification was 
carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and variable modifi-
cations were oxidation of methionine and deamidation of 
asparagine and glutamine. The mass tolerances were set 
to 10 ppm and 0.8 Da for peptide precursor and fragment 
ions, respectively. Protein identification was accepted as 
true positive if 2 different peptides were found to have 
scores greater than the homology or identity scores. </p>

Risks evaluations are essential activities of management 
of project risk. It is directly determines the success or failure 
of a project. It is often based on vague, inconsistent, parti-
ally subjective data (knowledge) items of interdisciplinary 
nature. 
For this reason, in risk management used different 
approaches, techniques and tools, both traditional and 
advanced. For example expert method, brainstorming, si-
mulation, fuzzy sets, e.g. methods of fuzzy numbers and 
fuzzy logic. 
The authors Banaitiene et al. present a research in area of 
construction projects. The aim of the research is to discover 
how construction companies perceive the significance of the 
construction projects risks they face and the extent to which 
they employ potential risk responses (Banaitiene et al. 
2011). Abstract. The article deals with the use of fuzzy logic as a support of evaluation of total project risk. A brief description of actual 
project risk management, fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic and the process of calculation is given. 
The major goal of this paper is to present am new expert decision-making fuzzy model for evaluating total project risk. This fuzzy 
model based on RIPRAN method. RIPRAN (RIsk PRoject ANalysis) method is an empirical method for the analysis of project 
risks. The Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> software was used to create the decision-making fuzzy model. The advantage of the 
fuzzy model is the ability to transform the input variables The Number of Sub-Risks (NSR) and The Total Value of Sub-Risks 
(TVSR) to linguistic variables, as well as linguistic evaluation of the Total Value of Project Risk (TVPR) -output variable. With this 
approach it is possible to simulate the risk value and uncertainty that are always associated with real projects. The scheme of the 
model, rule block, attributes and their membership functions are mentioned in a case study. The use of fuzzy logic is a particular 
advantage in decision-making processes where description by algorithms is extremely difficult and criteria are multiplied. </p>

<p>The case study presents the use of fuzzy logic at evaluation 
of total project risk base on RIPRAN method. The Fuzzy 
logic Toolbox of the <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> software was used for the 
creating of the decision making model. At first is it ne-
cessary to design the variables, their attributes and their 
membership functions. 
The developed expert decision-making fuzzy model 
system (ERS_TVPR) consists of two input ariables with 
five attributes, one rule block and one output variable also 
with five attributes. The inputs are represented by two varia-
bles: The Number of Sub-Risk (NSR) and The Total Value of 
Sub-Risks (TVSR). Both input variables are very important 
indicators based on RIPRAN method. The output from the 
rule block and the output variable is The Total Value of 
Project Risk (TVPR) (Fig. 3). 
It was used membership function of the shape Π in 
the model. This membership fuction names trapmf (tra-
pezoidal-shaped). Syntax of the function is following: y = 
trapmf(x,[a b c d]). Description of the trapezoidal curve is 
a function of a vector, x, and depends on four scalar para-
meters a, b, c, d, as given by </p>

<p>Figure 9 shows the evaluation of total project risk of concre-
te project. The input variables are set up NSR = 0, TVSR = 
0. It leads to the result (output) TVPR = 7.29 which means 
that the total risk of the project is very high. 
Using the first rule is expressed by the output variable 
TVPR coloration ( Fig. 9). 
Figure 9 shows the result, where the total value of risk of 
concrete project is evaluated as very high. The model was 
verified in this manner. The results match the requirement, 
so fuzzy model can be regarded generally as functional. 
After the model is created, it must be tuned (to set up the 
inputs on known values, evaluate the results and change the 
rules or weights, if necessary). The tuning and validation of 
the fuzzy model must be realised on real data of the project. 
The parameters of the model must be adjusted on the basis 
of the real data for each of the variables. If the validation 
shows, that the model provides relatively accurate results, 
can be used in practice. 
For implementation of fuzzy model in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> 
software was created executable file called "M-file". This file 
contains the following sequence of commands (Fig. 10). 
This file is used to enter the input values (NSR, TVSR) 
and automatically evaluate the total value of project risk 
(TVPR). 
The first line (see Fig. 10) loads a variable BCHRP from 
the file ERS_TVPR.fis. There are the parameters of fuzzy 
model in this file. The second line (see Fig. 10) loads the 
input variables: The Number of Sub-Risk (NSR); The Total 
Value of Sub-Risks (TVSR). The third line (see Fig. 10) im-
plements an evaluation with command evalfis. Inputs are va-
riable DataBTVPR and parametres of fuzzy model BTVPR. 
The value of the output is the variable EvaluationBTVPR. 
The fourth to ninth line (see Fig. 10) implements own eva-
luation. When the value of the output variable is evaluated 
less than 20, then the output linguistic value is Very high 
value of the total project risk. When the value of the output 
variable is evaluated in the interval from 20 to 40, then the 
output linguistic value is High value of the total project risk. 
When the value of the output variable is evaluated in the 
interval from 40 to 60, then the output linguistic value is 
Middle value of the total project risk. When the value of the 
output variable is evaluated in the interval from 60 to 80, 
then the output linguistic value is Low value of the total 
project risk. When the value of the output variable is eva-
luated more than 80, then the output linguistic value is Very </p>

<p>low value of the total project risk. Command fuzzy(BTVPR) 
displays and allows set-up work fuzzy model (see Fig. 10, 
line 10). Command mfedit(BTVPR) displays and allows 
edit membership functions of input and output variables 
(see Fig. 10, line 11). Command ruleedit(BTVPR) displays 
and allows edit fuzzy rules (see Fig. 10, line 12). Command 
surfview(BTVPR) displays graphical viewing dependency 
input and output variables (see Fig. 10, line 13). Command 
ruleview(BTVPR) displays and allows testing and simu-
lation output variable to input variables (see Fig. 10, line 14). 
If the M-file called TVPR.m is used to simulate (in 
<rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> software) a request to enter inputs [The Number 
of Sub-Risk and The Total Value of Sub-Risks] is displayed. 
After enter inputs e.g.: The Number of Sub-Risk = 0 and 
The Total Value of Sub-Risks = 0 in forme [0;0], is receive 
the result TVPR = Very high value of the total project risk 
(Fig. 11). 
After enter inputs e.g.: The Number of Sub-Risk = 100 
and The Total Value of Sub-Risks = 100 in forme [100;100], is </p>

<p>The advantage of this fuzzy model is the ability to trans-
form the input variables The Number od SUb-Risks (NSR) 
and The Total Value of Sub-Risk (TVSR) to linguistic va-
riables, as well linguistic evaluated The Total Value Project 
RIsk (TVPR) -output variable. With this approach it is 
possible to simulate an uncertainty that is always associated 
with projects. After the fuzzy model is constructed, it is 
necessary to tune it (to set up the inputs on known values, 
evaluate the results and to change the rules or weights, if 
necessary) when the model was built. If the fuzzy model is 
tuned, it is possible to use it in practice. For implement the 
fuzzy model in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> can also created an executable file 
called M-File. M-file is used to enter the input values and 
automatically evaluate the total risk of the project. 
The fuzzy model has a lot of benefits for users (pro-
ject managers and others). Some of them are: speed up the 
decision-making in risk management, automatization and 
standardization of risk analysis process, effective project 
management etc. </p>

sion level of five control genes that are highly invariant in expression 
during directed differentiation. Differentiation potential was calculated 
(Bock et al., 2011) for four gene classes (EC, ectoderm; ME, meso-

<p>The crystals of PvHCT2a-p-coumaroyl-CoA-shikimate and PvHCT2a-p-cou-
maroyl-CoA-protocatechuate were placed in a reservoir solution containing 
20% (v/v) glycerol, then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The X-ray data sets for 
PvHCT2a-p-coumaroyl-CoA-shikimate and PvHCT2a-p-coumaroyl-CoA-
protocatechuate were collected at the Berkeley Center for Structural 
Biology beamlines 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source at LBNL. 
The diffraction data were recorded using an ADSC-Q315r detector. The 
data sets were processed using the program <rs type="software">HKL-2000</rs> (Otwinowski and 
Minor 1997). 
The PvHCT2a-p-coumaroyl-CoA-shikimate structure was determined 
by the molecular-replacement method with the program <rs type="software">PHASER</rs> (McCoy 
et al. 2007) using the SbHCT structure (PDB ID 4KE4) (Walker et al. 2013) as a 
search model. The PvHCT2a-p-coumaroyl-CoA-shikimate structure was 
used as a search model to solve the PvHCT2a-p-coumaroyl-CoA-protoca-
techuate structure. Structure refinement was performed using the phenix.re-
fine program (Afonine et al. 2012). Manual rebuilding using <rs type="software">COOT</rs> (Emsley 
and Cowtan 2004) and the addition of water molecules allowed construction 
of the final model. Five percent of the data were randomly selected for cross-
validation. The final model of PvHCT2a-p-coumaroyl-CoA-shikimate and 
PvHCT2a-p-coumaroyl-CoA-protocatechuate have R and R free factors of 
15.9%/18.6% and 17.9%/20.5%, respectively. Root-mean-square deviation dif-
ferences from ideal geometry for bond lengths, angles and dihedrals were 
calculated with <rs type="software">Phenix</rs> (Adams et al. 2010). The overall stereochemical qual-
ity of the final models was assessed using the program <rs type="software">MolProbity</rs> (Davis 
et al. 2007). </p>

<p>Coverslips were mounted in a perfusion/stimulation chamber 
equipped with platinum-iridium field stimulus electrodes (EC-S-10, 
LCI, Seoul, Korea) on the stage of an Olympus IX-71 inverted 
microscope with Â 40, 1.0 NA oil lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). 
Neurons were continuously perfused at room temperature with 
Tyrode solution (136 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1.3mM 
MgCl 2 , 10mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 
0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid, 
10 mM glucose, pH 7.3). To reduce spontaneous activity and prevent 
recurrent excitation during stimulation, 10 mM 6-cyano-7-nitroqui-
noxaline-2, 3-dione and 50 mM of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric 
acid were added to the Tyrode solution. Time-lapse images were 
acquired every 5 s for 4 min using a back-illuminated Andor iXon 897 
EMCCD camera (Andor Technologies, Belfast, Northern Ireland) 
driven by MetaMorph Imaging software (Molecular Devices, Sunny-
vale, CA, USA). From the fourth frame, neurons were stimulated 
(1 ms, 20-50 V, bipolar) using an A310 Accupulser current stimulator 
(World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) to mimic action 
potential generation. Quantitative measurement of fluorescence 
intensity at individual boutons was obtained by averaging a selected 
area of pixel intensities using <rs type="software">MetaMorph</rs> software. Individual regions 
were selected by hand. Then, rectangular regions of interest were 
drawn around the synaptic boutons, and average intensities were 
calculated. Large puncta, typically representative of smaller synapse 
clusters, were rejected during the selection procedure. The center of 
intensity of each synapse was calculated to correct for any image shift 
over the course of the experiment. Fluorescence was expressed in 
intensity units that correspond to fluorescence values averaged over all 
pixels within the region of interest. Changes in net fluorescence were 
obtained by subtracting the average intensity of the first four frames 
(F 0 ) from the intensity of each frame (F t ) for individual boutons. 
They were then normalized to the maximum fluorescence intensity 
(F max ÀF 0 ) and averaged. For the exocytosis assays, neurons were pre-
incubated with bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) 
for 60 s to block re-acidification and stimulated for 30 s at 20 Hz/600

were presented. The differences were based 
on the estimate at 26 weeks of EQW minus 
the estimate for each comparator at 26 
weeks. SEs were also presented. Secondary 
end points were tested using similar MMRM 
analyses. Analyses of patient-reported out-
comes were performed without adjustment 
for multiple statistical testing. 
The original primary analysis excluded 
unscheduled postbaseline observations 
for unexpected early discontinuations; 
therefore, a modified analysis was com-
pleted, including all postbaseline observa-
tions. This modified MMRM analysis was 
performed after database lock when it was 
determined that the original analysis ex-
cluded patients who discontinued before

that the true mean was the same in all studies; as such, 
the flux from each study was weighted by sampling errors 
within the study only. In contrast, the random effect 
approach assumed that heterogeneity existed among the 
studies, and sampling errors of both within and between 
studies were used for weighting. Means and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) of the estimated values, combined 
with individual reported values, were included in one forest

sumption for the entire day, for the SBP and NSLP meals, and the percent 
of energy and food groups contributed by school meals were calculated 
using PROC SURVEYMEAN. All the results were weighted by the esti-

3 min, cuff deflation at maximum speed, and postocclu-
sive flux recording for a further 4 min. All data were pro-
cessed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">moorVMS</rs> recording and analysis software 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.3.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Moor Instruments</rs>). 
The variables of peak expressed as a percentage of 
baseline (P%BL) and time to peak (TtP) were chosen 
due to their representation of the magnitude and tem-
poral representation of the response and their estab-

<p>Cardiac autonomic function assessment 
A Polar RS800cx heart monitor (Polar Electro Oy, 
Kempele, Finland) was used to assess heart rate variabil-
ity (HRV) as a measure of cardiac autonomic function. 
Participants completed a supine 5 min rest recording. 
The R-R interval tachogram was analyzed with <rs id="software-1" type="software">Kubios 
HRV</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">V.2.1</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Kuopio</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2012</rs>). Ectopic beats were 
removed using linear interpolation of previous and sub-
sequent beats. Time and frequency domain parameters 
were assessed. Time domain measured included the SD 
of the N-N interval (SDNN) and the root mean square 
of the R-R intervals (RMS-SD). Frequency domain mea-
sures were divided by spectral power analysis into high 
(0.15-0.40 Hz), low (0.04-0.15 Hz), and very low-
frequency (0.00-0.04 Hz) powers with total power calcu-
lated as the sum of all powers.

tinuous due to a lack of cut-off values established to 
indicate pathology. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed in <rs id="software-2" type="software">Statistical Packages 
for the Social Sciences</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">V.22</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SPSS</rs>, 
Chicago, USA). Reliability of sensory neuropathy diagno-
sis was assessed with duplicate tests on a subset of 31 par-
ticipants 7-14 days apart. κ Statistics were calculated and 
interpreted as per Landis and Koch 
21 ≥0.75=excellent 
agreement, 0.4-0.75=fair to good agreement, and 
&lt;0.40=poor agreement. Reliability of continuous mea-
sures (HRV) was assessed with duplicate tests on a subset 
of 29 participants 7-14 days apart. Intraclass correlation 
coefficients were calculated and interpreted in accord-
ance with Portney and Watkins: &gt;0.75=good, 0.50-
0.75=moderate, and &lt;0.50=poor. </p>

<p>DegP and DEG1 from A. 
thaliana, representing the best examined Deg/HtrA proteases 
from animals, bacteria and plants respectively, were chosen as 
outgroups, since they do not belong to the DEG7 group [4]. 
Models of the first and second half of DEG7 were created using 
the <rs id="software-0" type="software">MODELLER</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9v6</rs> program [30] with multiple template 
alignment, using the structure files 2pzd.pdb [31], 1lcy.pdb [7], 
3cs0.pdb [12] and 1ky9.pdb [9] as templates. Manual assembly 
of the obtained structures into a DEG7 trimer was performed 
using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">PyMOL</rs> program (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.pymol.org/.</rs>/). </p>

<p>Recombinant DEG7 containing an N-terminal His 6 -tag was pro-
duced in E. coli strain BL21 Star 
TM (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) car-
rying plasmid pHS166. Cells were grown at 30 
• C in 2 litres 
of 2 × YT medium [1.6 % (w/v) tryptone/1 % (w/v) yeast 
extract/0.5 % NaCl] [32] containing 2 % (w/v) glucose and 
100 μg · l 
− 1 ampicillin to a D 600 of 0.8 and cooled down to 20 
• C. 
DEG7 overexpression was induced by adding 0.01 mM IPTG 
(isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) (final concentration). 
Cells were harvested after 3 h by centrifugation at 6000 g for 
10 min, resuspended in 2× PBS [32] supplemented with 20 mM 
2ME (2-mercaptoethanol) and Complete 
TM EDTA-free protease 
inhibitor cocktail (Roche) according to the manufacturer's 
instructions, and lysed by ultrasonification for 20 s, followed by 
incubation on ice for 60 s, repeated ten times. After clarification 
of the lysate by centrifugation at 23 000 rev./min for 1 h using a 
Beckman Coulter JS13.1 rotor, the supernatant was applied to a 
Ni 
2 + -NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) column using anÄKTA FPLC 
system (GE Healthcare) and washed first with 2× PBS containing 
20 mM 2ME, and then with 2× PBS containing 20 mM 2ME 
and 25 % (v/v) glycerol. His 6 -DEG7 was eluted with 50 mM 
imidazole and concentrated using Vivaspin concentrator tubes 
(Vivascience), and subjected to SEC using a Superdex 200 
16/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) and 2× PBS with 20 mM 
2ME to remove any remaining impurities. For a more accurate 
identification of the elution volume, the main fraction containing 
DEG7 (as identified by immunoblotting) was concentrated as 
described above and subjected to a second run on a Superdex 200 
16/300 GL column. To correlate elution volume and molecular 
mass, the column was calibrated with Blue Dextran, ferritin 
(440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa) and ovalbumin (43 kDa) according 
to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). 
Truncated versions of DEG7 with an N-terminal His 6 tag were 
produced at 30 
• C in E. coli strain BL21 Star 
TM (DE3) cells 
carrying plasmid pHS183, pHS184, pHS185 or pHS186. Cells 
were grown in 2 litres of 2 × YT medium [32] containing 2 % 
We searched freely available genome databases for genes encod-
ing DEG7-like proteases and retrieved hits for fungi and plant 
(including green, heterokont and haptophyte algae) genomes. 
All DEG7 orthologues share the unusual domain arrangement 
with two protease domains and up to four PDZ domains 
[2,4] (see Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.BiochemJ. 
org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm for sequence alignment data of the 
full-length proteins). The second protease domain is degenera-
ted and lacks the active-site residues, such as histidine, aspartic 
acid and serine (results not shown), but is still recognized when 
scanned against the InterPro database [35] and the <rs type="software">HHpred</rs> 
program [27] (results not shown). In contrast, four PDZ domains 
are not detected in every DEG7 orthologue, although the 
overall length of the proteins is comparable. This indicates 
that, provided the gene models retrieved from the databases 
are correct, some PDZ domains are not conserved enough to 
be detected by the domain prediction programs used in the 
present study. The domain architecture suggests that DEG7-like 
proteases evolved from a whole-gene duplication/fusion event 
of a DegP-like protease (containing a protease domain and two 
PDZ domains), followed by a subsequent degeneration of the </p>

<p>second protease domain (Figure 1, and Supplementary Figure 
S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm). No 
DEG7 orthologues were found in animals, since all hits have much 
shorter sequences and no hit contained a second protease domain 
(query coverage &lt;30 %; results not shown). Notably, genes 
coding for DEG7 orthologues were also absent from the genomes 
analysed of a primitive red alga (Cyanidioschyzon merolae), 
Cryptophyta (Guillardia theta and Hemiselmis andersenii) 
and diatoms (Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira 
pseudonana). 
Phylogenetic comparison (see Supplementary Figure S3 
at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm for se-
quence alignment data) confirmed the close evolutionary rela-
tionship of DEG7 orthologues from various organisms (Figure 2). 
Two main clades of DEG7 proteases can be distinguished: 
clade A contains DEG7 proteases from fungi, whereas DEG7 
proteins from green, heterokont and haptophyte algae, mosses 
and higher plants form clade B. Whereas most species investi-
gated possess only one DEG7-like gene, the genomes of the 
yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Schizosaccharomyces 
japonicus, the ascomycete Giberella zeae, the oomycete Phyto-
phtora soja, the haptophyte alga Emiliania huxleyi and the moss 
Physcomitrella patens contain two, whereas the higher plant 
Populus trichocarpa possesses three DEG7 paralogues (Figure 2). 
Expressed sequence tag data from S. pombe, P. patens and P. 
trichocarpa indicate that all paralogues are expressed in these 
organisms (<rs type="software">TGI</rs>; results not shown), but whether they have 
overlapping/complementary physiological roles is still unknown. 
The distribution of DEG7 proteases to two clades may reflect 
the different intracellular localizations for DEG7-like proteins 
from plants and fungi: DEG7 from A. thaliana was reported to be 
a plastidial [24] protein, whereas Ynm3p from yeast was found in 
the nucleus [21,22]. However, one of the two DEG7 paralogues 
from S. pombe and S. japonicus (Figure 2, marked with asterisks) 
is also present in clade B, together with their plant orthologues. 
Although the intracellular localization of these proteases has not 
been examined so far, a lack of plastids in yeast points to other 
than a plastidial localization. </p>

<p>The approximate position of the domains (as determined by using the InterProScan and <rs type="software">HHpred</rs> prediction servers) are indicated by black bars on top of the alignment. Conserved residues of catalytic 
triad are shown as blue letters above the alignment. For full names of organisms, see Supplementary Table S1. cons., consensus; *, identity; :, conserved replacement; ., non-conserved replacement. </p>

down of candidate genes was conducted in stage 9 egg chambers car-
rying asymmetric clones with respect to the anterior-posterior axis (see

were allowed to dry at room temperature and were kept in a (20%) controlled 
humidity chamber until used. The thickness of the dried films was estimated by 
averaging 10 measurements with a Mitutoyo digital micrometer. 
To construct the motor, the cellulosic film was produced in the form of a circular 
loop, 8.0 cm long, 1.0 cm wide, which passes over two 14 mm diameter wheels. 
The water vapor was generated by an AirProject ultrasonic humidifier (Italy 
ARTSANA Group). 
Photographs and movie of the cellulosic film and motor were taken with a Casio

<p>Immunostaining and microscopy 
Fixation with methanol or 3% PFA and permeabilization of cells were per-
formed as previously described (Balda et al., 1996; Matter and Balda, 
2003a). For the antibodies against active Cdc42 and Rac1 (NewEast 
Biosciences), cells were fixed in 3% PFA for 20 min at room temperature 
or methanol for 5 min at 20°C followed by a 3-min incubation in 0.3% 
Triton X-100 in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 10 mM glycine, 
and 0.1% sodium azide). The samples were then washed and incubated 
for 1 h in blocking buffer. After blocking and incubation with primary 
antibodies, the samples were incubated with the appropriate fluorescent 
secondary antibodies conjugated to either FITC, Cy3, or Cy5 (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in blocking buffer. In some experiments, 
fluorescent phalloidin was used (FITC and TRITC [Sigma-Aldrich]; Alexa 
Fluor 647 [Molecular Probes]), and Hoechst 33258 was used to label 
DNA (Invitrogen). Matrigel-grown samples were fixed with PFA and then 
incubated with blocking buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% 
SDS for 1 h. Antibody incubations were then also performed with the same 
detergent-containing blocking buffer. For tissue sections, colons were dis-
sected from adult female MF1 mice that had been transcardially perfused 
with 4% PFA in PBS, in accordance with UK Home Office regulations, 
embedded in OCT compound (VWR International) and snap frozen. 5-µm 
sections were then taken using a cryostat. For immunofluorescence stain-
ing, the sections were permeabilized with acetone/methanol (33:67) 
for 10 min at 20°C and then transferred to methanol/DMSO (4:1) for 
20 h at 4°C. The samples were then rehydrated with sequential changes 
of methanol decreasing from 75 to 50 and 25 to 0% in PBS at room tem-
perature for 5-10 min each. Next, the samples were further permeabilized 
and blocked for 8-10 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber in BSA 
permeabilization buffer (3% BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 
0.2% Na-dodecylsulfate, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) 
containing 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were then in-
cubated with goat anti-SH3BP1 and rabbit anti-ZO-1 for 16 h at room 
temperature in BSA permeabilization buffer containing 5% donkey serum 
in a humidified chamber. Afterward, samples were washed with PBS and 
BSA permeabilization buffer sequentially for 10-15 min in two cycles. 
Incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and Hoechst 
33258 in BSA permeabilization buffer was for 6 h at room temperature in 
BSA permeabilization buffer in a humidified chamber followed by washing 
with PBS and BSA permeabilization buffer for 10-15 min in two cycles 
and mounting with ProLong (Life Technologies). All fixed samples were 
embedded in ProLong Gold antifade reagent. All epifluorescent images 
of fixed specimens were acquired with a fluorescent microscope (DM IRB; 
Leica) using a 63×/1.4 NA oil immersion objective fitted with a camera 
(C4742-95; Hamamatsu Photonics) and <rs id="software-0" type="software">simplePCI</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Hamamatsu Photonics</rs>). Confocal images were acquired with a confocal laser-scanning 
microscope (LSM 700; Carl Zeiss) or a confocal microscope (SP2; Leica) 
using 63×/1.4 NA immersion oil objectives. Immersion oil (518 F; Carl 
Zeiss) was used for all objectives. Images were acquired at ambient 
temperature using <rs id="software-1" type="software">ZEN</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2009</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Carl Zeiss</rs>) or <rs id="software-2" type="software">LCS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Leica</rs>). Images were 
adjusted for brightness and contrast with <rs id="software-3" type="software">Photoshop</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Adobe</rs>). For FRET 
experiments, siRNA-transfected cells were plated into eight multiwell cham-
ber slides (ibidi), transfected with pRaichu-Cdc42, and analyzed using a 
microscope (SP2; 63×/1.4 NA objective, 37°C, in medium with 10 mM 
Hepes, pH 7.4) and <rs type="software">LCS</rs> FRET software using the donor recovery after 
acceptor bleaching protocol (YFP was bleached to 30%; Yoshizaki et al., 
2003; Terry et al., 2011). The shown FRET efficiency maps were then gen-
erated using the <rs type="software">LCS</rs> software by calculating the FRET efficiency according 
to the formal [(D post  D pre )/D post ] × 100 (D represents donor intensity). For 
quantification, CFP images were subtracted, and mean FRET intensities were </p>

<p>
quantified with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). For each image, all 
cell-cell contacts were quantified and as many internal areas; means of all 
cell-cell contacts and all internal areas in a field then gave one value each 
per imaged field, and these values were used for the final statistical analy-
sis. Normalizations were performed by dividing mean values obtained 
for specific fields by the mean values obtained for the entire field imaged. 
Time-lapse videos of A431 cells expressing an EGFP-actin construct were 
recorded at 37°C using a microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss) with a 
40×/0.6 NA objective and a camera (C4742-95). Videos were acquired 
with <rs type="software">SimplePCI</rs> software, recording images every 5 s. </p>

<p>Alternative splicing is emerging as a major mech-
anism for the expansion of the transcriptome and 
proteome diversity, particularly in human and other 
vertebrates. However, the proportion of alterna-
tive transcripts and proteins actually endowed 
with functional activity is currently highly debated. 
We present here a new release of <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> which 
now provides a unique annotation resource of 
human protein variants generated by alternative 
splicing. A total of 256 939 protein variants from 
17 191 multi-exon genes have been extensively 
annotated through state of the art machine learn-
ing tools providing information of the protein type 
(globular 
and 
transmembrane), 
localization, 
presence of PFAM domains, signal peptides, GPI-
anchor propeptides, transmembrane and coiled-
coil segments. Furthermore, full-length variants can 
be now specifically selected based on the annotation 
of CAGE-tags and polyA signal and/or polyA sites, 
marking transcription initiation and termination 
sites, respectively. The retrieval can be carried out 
at gene, transcript, exon, protein or splice site level </p>

<p>allowing the selection of data sets fulfilling one or 
more features settled by the user. The retrieval inter-
face also enables the selection of protein vari-
ants showing specific differences in the annotated 
features. <rs id="software-17" type="software">ASPicDB</rs> is available at <rs corresp="#software-17" type="url">http://www.caspur.it/ASPicDB</rs>/. </p>

<p>human through the ASPIC algorithm (12-14). The alter-
native splicing pattern of human multi-exon genes, 
determined by ASPIC, has been collected in <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs>, a 
database resource which presents some unique features 
with respect to other similar databases (15). The ASPIC 
algorithm implements an optimization strategy that, per-
forming a multiple alignment of all available transcript 
data (including full-length cDNA and EST sequences) to 
the relevant genome sequence, detects the set of introns 
that minimizes the number of splicing sites. It also gener-
ates through a directed-acyclic graph combinatorial 
procedure the minimal set of non-mergeable transcript 
isoforms compatible with the detected splicing events 
(14). The reliability of splicing isoforms detected 
by ASPIC has been recently established through a 
comparative assessment (16). 
The advent of massive transcriptome sequence data 
generated by RNA-Seq (17) is steadily increasing the 
number of validated splicing sites and isoforms in 
human and other organisms thus suggesting that a 
fraction of alternative splicing events are the result of 
background noise in the splicing process (18) which gen-
erates non-functional isoforms expressed at low level. 
Therefore, extensive research efforts are required to dis-
tinguish functional species-specific variants from 
non-functional ones originated from neutral drift in the 
splicing process, as well as to asses the biological role of 
functional isoforms. 
The annotation of the protein variants predicted with 
ASPIC is an essential step for exploring the functional 
and structural diversity of the proteins originating 
from the same gene by means of alternative splicing and 
therefore for unraveling the complex physiological effects 
of alternative splicing events (19). Indeed, currently avail-
able databases, such as <rs type="software">ASD</rs> (20), <rs id="software-20" type="software">ASAP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-20" type="version-number">II</rs> (21), 
<rs type="software">ASTALAVISTA</rs> (22) and <rs type="software">H-DBAS</rs> (23), mostly collect 
information on alternative transcripts at the mRNA level, 
without considering the effect of alternative splicing on the 
protein structure and function. The <rs type="software">ProSAS</rs> (24) database 
contains structural information as derived from compara-
tive modeling procedure, but due to the limitations of the 
modeling techniques, only $15% of the human transcripts 
are endowed with a reliable protein structure prediction. 
<rs type="software">ASPICdb</rs> aims at filling the gap of structural and func-
tional annotation of protein splicing variants, by adopting 
a set of analysis and prediction tools that do not rely only 
on annotation transfer by sequence similarity. It provides 
a thorough computational annotation of predicted human 
protein variants including PFAM domains (25), 
N-terminal signal peptides, GPI-anchor propeptides, 
transmembrane domains, subcellular localization and 
other features, also reporting the relevant crosslinks to 
<rs type="software">UniprotKB/Swissprot</rs> (26) and <rs type="software">PDB</rs> databases (27). A 
comprehensive annotation of the domain architecture 
and other structural features could also be extremely 
useful to critically assess the reliability of the functional 
classification provided the GO System (25), which still 
neglects much of the relevant information for alternative 
splicing products. 
In addition, in consideration of the fragmented nature 
of the available transcript data, the new version of </p>

<p><rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> include the annotation of CAGE tags (28) in 
order to identify truly transcription initiation sites and 
discriminate between full-length isoforms using alternative 
transcription initiations and 5 
0 -partial transcripts for 
which a full-length CDS and the encoded protein cannot 
be reliably predicted. </p>

<p>The computational pipeline implemented for supplement-
ing the <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> protein sequences with functional and 
structural annotations is represented in Figure 1 and inte-
grates several state-of-the-art tools for similarity search 
and for machine-learning based prediction of protein 
features starting from residue sequence. 
For each one of the 256 939 protein variants coming 
from 17 191 human genes, a first layer of annotation 
consists in the retrieval of similar sequences from the two 
major repositories containing well-characterized proteins, 
namely: (i) the <rs type="software">UniProtKB/SwissProt</rs> data base (26) 
(rel. 2010_07, June 2010), that contains 547 011 protein 
sequences with curated annotations, including 517 802 
principal entries and 29 209 splicing variants (UniProt 
Consotium, 2010); (ii) <rs type="software">the Protein Data Bank</rs> (rel. July 
2010), that contains resolved three dimensional structures 
for 50 171 different protein sequences (29). 
Similarity searches were performed with <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> (30) 
setting the E-value threshold to 10 
À3 . 
A second layer of annotation is obtained by mapping the 
structural and functional domains collected in the </p>

<p>PFAM-A database (rel. 24.0, October 2009) that contains 
curated multiple sequence alignments based on hidden 
Markov models (HMM) for 8691 families, 2985 domains, 
162 repeats and 74 motifs (25). The PFAM models were 
mapped on the <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> protein sequences by means of 
the pfam_scan.pl program (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/ 
databases/Pfam/Tools/), based on <rs id="software-34" type="software">HMMER</rs><rs corresp="#software-34" type="version-number">3.0</rs> (31). 
The third layer of annotation results from the integra-
tion of several predictors based on machine learning tools, 
such as neural networks, hidden Markov models, support 
vector machines and conditional random fields. Since 
most of the methods take advantage of the evolutionary 
information encoded in sequence profiles, we compiled 
them starting from the similar sequences retrieved with 
two PSI-BLAST iterations (setting the E-value threshold 
to 10 
À3 ) from the UniRef90 data set consisting of 
6 955 504 sequences (July 2010). The first predicted 
features are the presence of N-terminal signal peptide 
and of C-terminal GPI-anchor propeptides, with 
SPEPlip (32) and PredGPI (33), respectively. Both the 
methods are among the best available predictors, scoring 
with accuracy as high as 95% the former and 88% the 
latter. When present, the signal peptide and the propeptide 
are cleaved from the protein sequence. The presence of 
coiled-coil domains is predicted with CCHMM-PROF 
that is able to locate coiled-coil segments in protein se-
quences with 80% accuracy (34). a-Helical transmem-
brane domains are then predicted with <rs type="software">ENSEMBLE</rs> 
(35), that discriminates transmembrane from globular 
proteins with false positive and false negative rates both 
equal to 3%. The same tool is adopted for predicting the 
number and the position of transmembrane segments 
along the sequence, with an accuracy of 90% on the 
protein base. The subcellular localization of globular 
proteins is predicted with <rs type="software">BaCelLo</rs> (36), which discrimin-
ates four localizations in animals (secretory pathway, 
cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondrion) with 74% 
accuracy. </p>

<p>Table 1 reports some statistics on the data contained in the 
current version of <rs id="software-37" type="software">ASPicDB</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-37" type="version-number">version 2.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-37" type="version-date">August 2010</rs>) 
which refers only to human multi-exon genes annotated 
in NCBI Entrez Gene (37) with at least one RefSeq </p>

<p>transcript (38) and the relevant Unigene cluster (39) 
collecting all available gene-specific cDNA and EST 
sequences. 
In the current version of <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> some more features 
are available including the annotation of the CAGE tags 
(28) which define truly transcription initiation sites and a 
comprehensive protein annotation. A total of 12 789 394 
CAGE tags have been mapped thus supporting constitu-
tive or alternative transcription start sites. To each tran-
script variant a 'unique identifier' (16) has been associated 
in order to make possible the unambiguous comparison 
with alternative transcripts collected in other databases. 
All alternative proteins collected in <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> have been 
compared with <rs type="software">UniprotKB/SwissProt</rs> (26) and <rs type="software">PDB</rs> (29) 
databases. The results of similarity searches are reported 
in Table 2. Only 17% of the <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> protein sequences 
are identical to proteins deposited in <rs type="software">UniProtKB/ 
SwissProt</rs> database. However, 94% of the sequences 
share significant similarity with proteins annotated in the 
same database, prompting the possibility of a reliable an-
notation transfer. Moreover, 54% of <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> sequences 
are similar to proteins deposited in the <rs type="software">PDB</rs> suggesting 
that their structures can be modeled, at least partially. 
A considerable amount of PFAM models map on the 
<rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> sequences (Table 2). On the overall, 71% of 
sequences match with at least one model. This result is 
in agreement with the reported sequence coverage on the 
human proteome of the current PFAM release, which is 
equal to 72.5% (25). It is worth noticing that, although all 
the models map with an E-value &lt; 10 
À5 , only 20% of the 
matches are complete (that is, involve the whole model). A 
note of caution is necessary when inferring features from 
partial matches and the actual extent of the match has to 
be evaluated for each instance. 
Table 3 summarizes the results of the annotation 
process performed with machine learning based predict-
ors. Two percent of proteins were not predicted since they 
are shorter than 50 residues, 16% of proteins are predicted 
as transmembrane and 82% are predicted as globular. 
Among the globular proteins, 12% are predicted as 
secreted, 35% as cytoplasmic, 27% as globular and 8% 
as mitochondrial. Signal peptides and GPI-anchor 
propeptides are predicted in the 12 and 0.7% of the </p>

<p>Table 1. Statistics of the <rs id="software-50" type="software">ASPicDB</rs> content (v<rs corresp="#software-50" type="version-number">2.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-50" type="version-date">August 2010</rs>) </p>

<p>sequences, respectively. Coiled-coil domains are predicted 
in 1.3% of the proteins. At the gene level, 30 and 92% of 
genes encode for transmembrane and globular proteins, 
respectively. Since the sum exceed 100%, it follows that 
22% of the genes encode for both globular and transmem-
brane variants. The same consideration holds for the other 
annotations as reported in Table 4. The amount of genes 
predicted to encode for proteins with different subcellular 
localization achieves 56%. This is partially explained by 
the fact that <rs type="software">BaCelLo</rs> scores with an accuracy equal to 
74%, which is the lowest among the methods included in 
the pipeline. Indeed the discrimination between the 'cyto-
plasmic' and the 'nuclear' classes is still a difficult task for 
all subcellular localization predictors (40). When the two 
classes are merged together, the <rs type="software">BaCelLo</rs> accuracy in-
creases up to 91%, but the rate of genes encoding for 
proteins with different localizations is still as high as 
44%, suggesting that localization diversity is inherent in 
the <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> protein variants. The structure of PFAM 
annotations is also highly variable: 38% of genes encode 
for variants matching with different number and/or type 
of PFAM models. Altogether, results listed in Table 4 
suggest that alternative transcripts can encode for 
proteins endowed with different structural and functional 
features. <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> provides a unique resource reporting 
the annotation of alternative splicing variants at the 
protein level and an interface enabling the discovery of 
such differences. </p>

<p><rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs> can be accessed though simple or advanced 
query forms. The simple query form allows the user to 
obtain the splicing pattern of one or more genes selected 
according to several criteria (e.g. HGNC name, RefSeq or 
Unigene accession IDs, etc.). The advanced query form 
allows the user to search for (i) genes, (ii) transcripts; 
(iii) exons; (iv) splicing sites; and (v) proteins, fulfilling 
different criteria (e.g. exons in a given length range, 
etc.). Depending on the choice separate query forms 
appear. The 'gene', 'transcript' and 'splicing sites' query 
forms have been described previously (15) whereas the 
'exon' and 'protein' query forms are novel features of 
this version of <rs type="software">ASPicDB</rs>. The exon query form allows 
the user to select exons in a given length range, belonging 
to a specific type (initial, internal or teminal), flanked by 
specific splicing sites or associated to one or more 
Affimetrix ExonArray probeset IDs. 
The 'protein' query form allows the retrieval of tran-
scripts encoding proteins isoforms of a specific class (e.g. 
globular or transmembrane), subcellular localization (e.g. 
mitochondrion, nucleus, secretory, cytoplasm) or contain-
ing one or more features, including occurrence and 
number of PFAM or transmembrane domains, GPI-
anchor propeptides, signal peptides. Finally, it is also 
possible to retrieve genes encoding for alternative 
proteins that show differences in the above mentioned 
features. </p>

<rs type="software">SwissProt/UniprotKB</rs>. Two more variants are reported in that file, although lacking of experimental annotations. Several repetitions of Sushi

<p>N the recent past -perhaps owing to perceptions of increased uncertainty in the wake of 
the Great Recession and the related slowdown in the growth of world trade -a number of 
long-term economic projections have been made, ranging from a time horizon of several 
decades to almost one hundred years ahead, with some of these studies also touching upon the 
prospects for international trade. These include qualitative, multidisciplinary analyses, such as 
European Commission (2012), multisector partial equilibrium models, such as IMF (2012) as 
well as computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, such as World Bank (2007). While the 
studies make assumptions about productivity advances, which then shape sectoral develop-
ments, they do not employ an explicit model of economic growth. Other studies, such as Duval 
and de la Maisonneuve (2010), Four e et al. (2013), Asian Development Bank (2011) and 
OECD (2012), provide economic growth projections over the long term. Only a few papers 
have combined the two approaches, linking models of economic growth to sectoral simula-
tions. Petri and Zhai (2013) use the growth projections by the ADB (2011) as a baseline for 
their CGE model. They focus on the economic prospects of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN), China and India by the year 2030. Anderson and Strutt (2012) make predic-
tions for Asia at the same time horizon (2030), supplementing the growth predictions from 
ADB (2011) with the ones from Four e et al. (2013) for countries not contained in the former 
study. Finally, Fontagn e et al. (2013) combine <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">CEPII</rs>'s macroeconomic model (<rs id="software-1" type="software">MaGE</rs>) with 
its multisectoral dynamic CGE model of the world economy (<rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs>). This study considers 
economic prospects up to the year 2100, making some simplifying assumptions about key 
exogenous variables, and principally aims at providing a baseline for the evaluation of climate 
change policies, although some sectoral and trade issues are discussed as well. 
Our paper seeks to extend this relatively small, but rapidly expanding body of the literature 
in a number of ways: first, using the methodology described in detail in Fontagn e and Four e 
(2013), we combine an explicit economic growth model with a multisectoral model in order 
to construct scenarios for the world as a whole (around 150 countries) up to a maximum time 
horizon (year 2035), for which reasonable forecasts of a number of key variables (e.g. energy 
prices, demographics) can be obtained from specialised institutions (e.g. IEA, 2011; UNPD, </p>

<p>This paper combines CGE modelling (<rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs>) with the macroeconometric model 
<rs type="software">MaGE 
1</rs> to address the sectoral implications of the envisaged growth trajectory of national 
economies. 
2 The driving forces of the changes modelled with MIRAGE are the change in 
countries' GDP per capita, the (sectorally differentiated) gains in total factor productivity 
(TFP) by these countries, their changing comparative advantage and evolving country sizes. 
On the demand size, country size and GDP per capita determine the size of markets and 
demand composition. With the reshaping of the world economy, the patterns of international 
demand will be affected profoundly. Meanwhile, the capabilities of countries will change, as 
developing economies accumulate human capital, invest in infrastructure and new production 
capacities and progressively catch up in terms of efficiency. Finally, markets will change as 
well as exporters, leading to a profound revamping of world trade patterns. MIRAGE is pro-
viding a detailed description of these changes for a given classification of countries and 
regions and a given sectoral aggregation of traded goods and services. The transformations of </p>

modelling frameworks used in great depth. See Fontagn e and Four e (2013). Both are also jointly referred 
to in WTO (2013). </p>

<p>bilateral and sectoral trade flows are driving changes in the sectoral value added in each coun-
try, which leads to a reallocation of resources and ultimately changes in factor prices. Last 
but not least, these reference trajectories will be 'bent' by the shocks to trade costs or the 
migratory movements simulated in various scenarios. 
To track these repercussions, CGE modelling is essential. The even bigger advantage of 
CGE analysis is its internal consistency: markets are cleared; what is produced somewhere is 
bought elsewhere; available production factors bind the production capacities of countries; 
sectors must invest to produce; excess demand will be covered by net imports; the external 
account will be balanced by capital flows when needed or else the real exchange rate (country 
competitiveness) will have to adjust. Such intrinsic consistency is precious when it comes to 
addressing issues of an extremely high dimensionality, with many countries growing at differ-
ent speeds, trading with each other in various sectors ranging from agriculture to business ser-
vices. In our mind, this intrinsic consistency in the representation of the changing patterns of 
the world economy, when all factors of growth are combined at the country level, is an enor-
mous asset to conduct large-scale and medium-term foresight activities. Still, it has limits 
which have to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. These limits are either common 
to any CGE model of this type, or specific to the version of <rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs> used here. 
Common to all CGE approaches are the simplicity of the functional forms describing agent 
behaviour and the rather aggregated representation of the world economy, both imposed by 
computational constraints. The downside of such aggregation is that models do not track what is 
happening within a given sector in a given region. Similarly, simple functional forms (e.g. the 
absence of intertemporal optimisation by individual agents) imply that the dynamics of the 
model are rather elementary -meaning sequential. The model is solved sequentially, on a yearly 
step, and transition from one period to the next relies on changes in capital depletion, the sec-
toral allocation of new capital as well as changes in the labour force, TFP and energy efficiency. 
Also, the parameterisation of key behavioural parameters is rather crude and hardly addresses 
individual countries' idiosyncrasies. As sectors are aggregated, models do not fully reflect what 
could happen within a sector affected by, for example, a tariff cut on one product. Changes in 
tariffs, as any obstacles to trade, are modelled at the sectoral level, even if shocked at the most 
detailed level before aggregation. This implies that the impact of changes in trade costs (which 
depends on the variance of the trade costs on the top of the mean) is not measured precisely and 
that the creation of new flows of exports, the so-called extensive margin of trade, is not 
accounted for. In a nutshell, a country that does not export a category of goods will not begin to 
export these goods, when trade costs in the sector come down, as the trade elasticity is applied 
to a zero flow. Last but not least, CGE models generally are not confronted with historical data 
for validation. Partial remedies were considered in the current exercise, notably by making sure 
that <rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs> reproduces the observed past response of trade to changes in world income. More 
specifically, some of the literature addressing the recent slowdown in the growth of international 
trade have pointed to the slowing pace of international vertical specialisation (Constantinescu 
et al., 2015; Crozet et al., 2015) besides slow GDP growth as a possible explanation. Therefore, 
at the global level in the reference case, <rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs> is set to reproduce a conservative elasticity of 
world trade to income observed in the long run, with the exception of the 1990s, a transitory per-
iod characterised by the expansion of global value chains and the surge of new big traders. 
Not all limitations could be addressed in this framework: for instance, if decisions were to 
depend on the future state of the economy, and uncertainty to be taken into account, a differ-
ent class of models (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models) would need to be used, 
which hardly allow for any sectoral or regional decomposition. Regarding the extensive </p>

<p>We also faced specific computational or data constraints in our present endeavour that might 
be circumvented in other simulations. The first issue concerns the representation of competition 
among firms. Many CGE models fit imperfect competition, and this can also be done in 
<rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs>. However, given the long-term horizon of the exercise and the structural changes of 
the economies at stake, we were neither confident that the initial parameterisation of the model 
would fit well the development of these economies, nor were we convinced that the same 
parameterisation of market structures could apply in different economies. Combined with addi-
tional computing complexity, this led us to work with perfect competition. One important con-
sequence of this choice is that our estimation of the gains from trade (via consumer demand or 
via producers' purchases of intermediate goods) is rather conservative, as it does not reflect 
variety gains, scale economies or firm selection. For the present endeavour, this is of lesser 
importance, as we do not focus on the gains from trade and specialisation, but on trade patterns. 
The next limitation relates to trade in services. Not all modes of supply (as defined by the 
WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Art. I:2) are modelled in our exer-
cise. We model services exported under mode 1 (cross-border trade) and mode 2 (consumption 
abroad), but modes 4 (presence of natural persons) and 3 (commercial presence) are absent. 
Quantitatively, this is not a major problem regarding mode 4, which is currently still small, 
although this might change substantially in the future. More importantly, the absence of ser-
vices supply via commercial presence abroad is due to our decision not to activate the foreign 
direct investment (FDI) module in <rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs>. We made this choice as a result of the lack of 
reliable information on future movements of FDI (although a snapshot of the current situation, 
which is usable for CGE modelling purposes, is provided by Guimbard et al., 2012). This limi-
tation is linked to the more general problem regarding foreign presence. We do not have reli-
able information on the activity of foreign affiliates, with some exceptions (United States and, 
quite recently, EU Member States). The reason for this lack of information is that FATS (For-
eign Affiliate Trade in Statistics) are not collected systematically and that FDI stocks (when 
available) are a poor proxy for the activity of foreign affiliates (Fukui and Lakatos, 2012). 
Besides these intrinsic limitations of CGE models and the specific choices made for this 
modelling exercise, CGE models are said not to take into account an important development 
of international trade patterns in recent times, namely the expansion of global value chains 
(GVCs), exemplified by 'Factory Asia' (WTO-IDE-JETRO, 2011). The development of GVCs 
changes many aspects of trade patterns, how to analyse them and the way in which technol-
ogy, services, investment and trade interplay (Elms and Low, 2013). For example, it can be 
shown that services are increasingly also traded indirectly through trade in goods (Stehrer, 
2012). Baldwin (2011) provides a theoretical framework explaining why the fragmentation of 
production occurs. In order to understand the implications of global production networks for 
CGE modelling, it is important to recall that CGE modelling is in line with input-output stud-
ies a la Leontief, and, in addition, puts emphasis on prices, market clearing and substitution. 
Inter-industry relationships are instrumental for the construction of CGE models, and the ori-
gin (domestic or imported) of intermediate consumption is traced. As the results of changing </p>

<p>3 See Gouel et al. (2011) for development of <rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs> at the product level and Balistreri et al. (2011) 
for an inclusion of firm heterogeneity. </p>

<p>
trade patterns can be expressed in terms of value added (and this is what we do here), it is 
possible to say that GVCs are intrinsically embodied in CGE models, even if trade is not 
reported in value-added terms in the simulations. 
4 This way of addressing the international 
fragmentation of production is still far from perfect. In <rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs>, the geographic composition 
of the basket of intermediates applies overall and is not differentiated by importing sector. 
We can, for instance, track the various origins of imported steel in a country, but we cannot 
know the origin of steel imported by the car industry. We simply assume that the geographic 
origins of steel imports in that sector are similar to the overall distribution in the economy. 
Hence, GVCs de facto are present in CGE models, such as <rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs>, but are not modelled as 
such owing to this proportionality assumption. Also, the activity of foreign affiliates is present 
in the database, but not identified as such, and the composition by country of origin of each 
imported intermediate product is present, but not at the level of the importing industry. 
Although trade is expressed in gross terms, changes in the value added of the sector mirror 
the reaction of industries to trade shocks and take into account international input-output rela-
tions, albeit with less detail than in dedicated GVC studies. </p>

<p>This section analyses the relative contribution of the fundamental economic factors simu-
lated each at a time under the two different scenarios in <rs type="software">MaGE</rs>. An overview showing the rel-
ative deviation from economic growth under the reference scenario attributable to each main 
economic driver is given in Figure 1. </p>

<p>The direction, composition and nature of international trade have changed substantially 
over the past couple of decades, and many of these trends may be related to the proliferation 
of GVCs. Emerging economies have gained a larger share in global trade and increasingly 
trade with one another. At the sectoral level, developing countries have diversified their 
exports and obtained a higher overall share in manufacturing trade. The importance of ser-
vices trade has also risen. At the same time, much of 'global' trade is actually concentrated at 
the regional level. In analysing country, sector and factor outcomes of our integrated <rs type="software">MaGE</rs> 
and <rs type="software">MIRAGE</rs> simulations in more detail, we will now examine to what extent these trends in 
trade can be expected to continue in the future. 
Table 2 gives an overview of the combined macroeconomic and trade simulations in terms 
of projected average annual growth rates of GDP and exports up to 2035. Exports of goods 
are likely to vary more than GDP in the 'high' scenario despite the very conservative elastic-
ity used in our model, as noted in Section 2. In the 'low' scenario, by contrast, trade would 
grow much slower and even less than GDP. Whether a future scenario of key economic and 
policy variables is rather optimistic or pessimistic matters a lot more for developing than for 
developed countries, with the former being characterised by a much larger variation in out-
comes than the latter. While growth rates are generally lower in a gloomy economic and trade 
environment across both groups of countries, the difference is barely three-quarters of a per 
cent for developed countries' average GDP growth, but over 4 per cent for developing coun-
tries. Growth in GDP and services trade in developing countries is widely superior to growth 
rates in developed countries in the optimistic scenario, but much less so in a pessimistic </p>

<p>Search engines are an important way of obtaining information on the Internet. According 
to Alexa Traffic Rank, Google.com is the most popular web site in the United States 
as well as in the world, and in May 2011, it was the first web site to achieve one 
billion monthly unique visitors. 
1 Many people use search engines as a starting point for 
navigating the Web, making search engines a crucial link in connecting content providers 
and users. This has spurred a sizable literature on search marketing that studies clicking 
behavior at search engines. To date, most of this literature has concentrated on the 
sponsored links that are typically displayed alongside organic links when consumers 
conduct searches. 
Although most of the economics and marketing literature on search engines has 
focused on paid clicks, the bulk of the traffic retailers receive through search engines 
is actually through unpaid clicks on organic links (Jerath et al., 2014). 
2 For this reason, 
more advertisers engage in search engine optimization (SEO) to improve organic clicks 
than purchase sponsored links to get paid clicks (Berman and Katona, 2013). To the 
best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first to provide search marketers with 
information on drivers of organic clicks to aid in SEO. 
Existing studies of sponsored search are typically based on a modest number of 
search terms and the corresponding number of paid clicks received by a single retailer. 
Our research complements these studies by focusing on the organic clicks that 759 retail 
sites received from more than 12,000 search terms. There is considerable cross-sectional 
variation in our data: It includes Web-only retailers as well as traditional retailers and 
covers 15 different retail segments including apparel, electronics, and mass merchants. 
For each of these search terms, we observe which retail sites received organic clicks as 
well as the number of clicks. We also obtained data from the first five pages of search 
results on <rs type="software">Google</rs> and <rs type="software">Bing</rs> for each search term, and this ultimately permits us to 
quantify the impact on organic clicks of a site's rank (position) in the search results. 
Our data also include several different measures of the accumulated brand equity of 
online retailers. These data allow us to determine whether consumers are more likely 
to click the link of a retailer who is perceived to operate a high-quality site (as a result 
of the retailer's current and past investments in advertising, the depth and breadth of 
offerings, secure payments, one-click purchases, returns policies, and so on). Ultimately, 
this permits us to quantify the benefits of SEO strategies that attempt to gain traffic by 
improving a retailer's rank in organic search results, versus gaining traffic by improving 
the quality and brand awareness of a site. 
Not surprisingly, we find that a retailer's rank on a results page is an important 
driver of its organic clicks: Exclusion from the first five pages of results for a search leads 
to a 90% reduction in organic clicks. For retailers that are listed on the first five pages of 
results, a 1% improvement in rank leads to 1.3% more organic clicks for that search. </p>

<p>1. <rs type="software">Alexa Traffic Rank</rs> is calculated by combining a web site's average number of daily visitors and page 
views over the past month. 
2. Our data are consistent with this finding. </p>

<p>Figure 1 highlights the avenues that retailers have for gaining traffic through search 
engines. This screenshot shows the search results that appear following a search for 
"shoes online" using <rs type="software">Google Search</rs>. In this particular example, three different types of 
links appear: top ads, side ads, and organic results. 
3 The top ads (marked by the red 
box in Figure 1), if any, are the highest listed search results and appear against a yellow 
background. For this particular search there are three top ads; the maximum number of 
top ads that may be displayed is four. The organic results (marked by the blue box) are 
listed below the top ads. Up to ten organic results can appear on a search result page. 
Finally, the side ads (purple box) appear on the right-hand side of the screen; Google 
allows for up to eight side ads to be shown on a result page. </p>

<p>One way retailers obtain traffic is through the paid links that appear in top or side 
ads. Unlike organic links, retailers can directly influence the position of ads, which are 
displayed and ranked according to the results of an auction that is run in real time. 
Retailers identify keywords they want to bid on and specify how much they are willing 
to spend. <rs type="software">Google</rs> determines the ad rank using a site's maximum bid specified for 
the keyword and a quality score, which includes factors like click-through rates and 
relevance. Advertisers only pay when the link is clicked; the cost per click is equal to the 
minimum amount needed to get a specific position (generalized second-price auction 
mechanism). There is an extensive literature (discussed below) examining this avenue 
for obtaining clicks. 
A second way retailers obtain traffic through the search engine channel is through

<p>Our main dataset is assembled using data from <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">comScore</rs> <rs id="software-3" type="software">Search Planner</rs> and contains 
information on the number of organic clicks web sites received for search terms and 
phrases entered at main search engines (i.e., <rs type="software">Google</rs>, <rs type="software">Bing</rs>, <rs type="software">Yahoo</rs>, <rs type="software">AOL</rs>, and <rs type="software">ASK</rs>) 
during August 2012. <rs type="software">Search Planner</rs> uses the comScore panel, which contains all online 
browsing activity of around two million U.S. users. Because our goal is to analyze the 
drivers of organic traffic following product searches, we restrict our sample to only 
include web sites that are Internet retailers. For this we make use of Internet Retailer's 
Top 500 Guide, which contains a ranking of North America's 500 largest e-retailers 
based on annual Web sales. Although not all of these retailers appeared in the comScore 
Search Planner database, some e-retailers (e.g., Amazon) operate multiple web sites 
(e.g., Amazon.com and Zappos.com), resulting in a total of 759 retail sites for which 
we have click-through data. For each of these 759 retailers, we used Search Planner to 
identify all search terms that generated traffic from <rs type="software">Google</rs> to the retailer. There is some 
overlap in search terms: as shown in Figure 1, Onlineshoes.com as well as Zappos.com 
appear relatively high in the organic results for the term "shoes online," which means 
that for both retailers this term is part of the set of search terms that generated traffic 
from Google. In total we end up with 12,184 distinct search terms that led users to the 
759 online retailers. The third dataset we use contains all the links that appeared on the 
first five search results pages on <rs type="software">Google Search</rs> and Bing Search for each of the 12,184 
search phrases. We collected these data using a scraper written in <rs type="software">Java</rs>; the data contain 
organic search results as well as paid links. </p>

<p>unlikely to show up in the search results for "shoes online." 
11 Given that a retail site 
must be listed on the search results pages to receive organic clicks, we only include a 
retailer as an observation for a specific search term if we observe the retail site in our 
search results data. Because we only captured the first five pages of search results, this 
does not rule out that a site that did not appear in these search results did in fact get 
clicks; we therefore also include a retail site if the site received organic clicks for the 
search term according to the Search Planner database. 
Our measure of a retail site's brand equity is based on the methodology devel-
oped in Baye et al. (2012) to overcome challenges in measuring the "prominence" of 
online retailers' names. These authors point out that the standard approach, which uses 
historical advertising data to measure accumulated brand equity and the strength of 
a firm's name, is not useful in the case of online retailers. Among other things, many 
online retailers are privately held and do not disclose advertising expenditures; the 
parent companies of publically traded online retailers do not typically report monthly 
advertising expenditures at the URL level. They further argue that the number of prod-
uct searches on <rs type="software">Google</rs> (or <rs type="software">Bing</rs>) that include the retailer's name or URL in the search 
query-navigational searches, in industry parlance-is a useful measure of a retailer's 
brand equity. Intuitively, the inclusion of "Amazon" in a product search indicates the 
consumer recognizes the company and can recall its name. This may be the result of 
past advertising campaigns, recommendations from friends, knowledge of Amazon's 
pricing practices, product depth, return policies, and so on. And in contrast to adver-
tising expenditures, it is possible to use data from comScore to measure the number of 
navigational searches Amazon received in a given month. 
Based on a revealed preference argument, Baye et al. conclude that the number of 
navigational searches for a retailer in a given month embodies more than name recog-
nition or recall; the inclusion of a retailer's name in a product search indicates that the 
consumer values the attributes associated with its name (e.g., its reputation, product 
breadth, product depth, and service quality), and that search results with links to that 
particular retailer are desirable. Baye et al. provide evidence that this measure works 
well in both retail and education contexts. 
12 For example, they show that there is a 
strong relationship between navigational searches for universities and external rank-
ings of their quality: Universities with stronger brand names (e.g., Harvard University) 
receive significantly more navigational searches than universities with weaker brand 
names (e.g., Indiana University). Moreover, they provide evidence that the prestige of a 
university-not its size-is the main driver of the navigational searches it receives. 
For these reasons, we use navigational searches to measure a firm's brand equity. 
Navigational searches are essentially a shortcut for typing in the URL of a specific retailer 
and then searching its site. Thus, our measure of brand equity is the total number of 
organic clicks a particular retailer received in August 2012 from searchers who navigated </p>

<p>11. Indeed, Best Buy did not show up in at least the first 30 pages of search results on <rs type="software">Google</rs> for the search 
term "shoes online" (checked on February 26, 2013). 
12. Although many of the general branding principles carry over to retailers, the measurement of retail 
brand equity provides some unique challenges; Ailawadi and Keller (2004) identify some unique issues to the 
measurement of retail brand equity. For our purposes, the key is that this measure is related to the overall 
image of an online retailer and its attributes, which includes factors like name recognition, product breadth 
and depth, shopping experience, and reputation (prices, quality, shipping, return policy, etc.). </p>

<p><rs type="software">Google</rs> continuously updates its rankings of search results to generate the most relevant 
search results, which means that our rank variable will depend on past clicks. It is 
therefore likely that rank is correlated with the error term and thus endogenous. A 
similar effect may be at work for the ads variable: Ad positions are based on the outcome 
of a second-price auction that takes the relevance of the bidder with respect to the search 
term into account, again making it likely that ad positions are based on past clicking 
behavior on Google. 
The standard approach in the literature on clicks at platforms (e.g., clicks at price 
comparison sites or sponsored clicks at search engines) is to assume that such positions 
are exogenous. Using the Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity, however, we reject the 
hypothesis that rank and ad positions are exogenous in our data ( p = 0.0023 and p = 
0.0116, respectively). To account for the potential endogeneity of these variables, we use 
information about rank and ads on <rs type="software">Bing</rs> as instruments. These instruments are correlated 
with the endogenous regressors, but are unlikely to be correlated with the error term, 
because <rs type="software">Bing's</rs> decisions on search result rankings and ad positions are not based on 
past clicks on <rs type="software">Google</rs>. Indeed, using the Sargan test for overidentifying restrictions, we 
cannot reject the hypothesis that these are valid instruments for rank and ad positions 
on Google ( p = 0.3795). 
One might also worry that our measure of brand equity is correlated with the error 
in equation (1). For example, if users begin searching for products with generic search 
phrases and end their searches with a navigational search, navigational searches may 
be driven by organic search results, and thus endogenous. Based on the Wu-Hausman 
test, however, we cannot reject the hypothesis that our measure of brand equity is 
exogenous. 
16 Our main results thus treat only position and ads as endogenous. Section 4 
shows that our results are robust to the use of three alternative measures of brand equity 
that are also unlikely to be correlated with the errors. </p>

<p>As we explained in Section 2.1, a retail site is included as an observation if it appears on 
the first five pages of the <rs type="software">Google</rs> search result page for a specific search term, independent </p>

<p>15. Retail segment fixed effects control for systematic differences in clicks across, for example, mass 
merchants who may receive many clicks owing to product breadth effects and specialty retailers who receive 
fewer clicks. Although this specification assumes the marginal impact of brand equity and rank is identical 
across retail segments, we show in Section 4 that the results are similar when one excludes mass merchants 
such as Amazon and Walmart. 
16. The p-value for this test, which uses navigational searches on <rs type="software">Bing</rs> as an instrument, is p = 0.1692. </p>

<p>of whether the retailer received organic clicks according to Search Planner. Complicating 
matters, <rs type="software">Search Planner</rs> only reports the number of organic clicks if those clicks exceed 
a certain threshold, which means we do not know whether sites receiving zero organic 
clicks according to Search Planner really received no click-throughs for the search term 
in question or whether they were censored. 
What makes our setting different from a standard censoring environment is that 
the selection rule depends on total clicks (including paid clicks) rather than just organic 
clicks. This means that a different probability mechanism generates both the zero clicks 
and the positive clicks, and this cannot be captured by a standard Tobit censoring 
model. For this reason, we estimate a Heckman-type selection model. As we argued in 
the previous subsection, endogeneity is likely to be important in our data, so we allow 
for endogenous explanatory variables. Estimation of the model consists of two stages. In 
the first stage we regress a dummy for having positive clicks on all exogenous variables 
(including instruments) z. Here, it is important to include at least one more instrument 
than is necessary for dealing with the endogeneity problem (otherwise identification is 
purely based on the parametric form of the inverse Mills ratio). This additional exclusion 
restriction should relate to the probability of observing positive organic clicks. Because 
this probability relates to the number of total clicks, we use additional variables in 
the selection equation that are important for getting paid clicks: We add dummies for 
whether a sponsored link was displayed on each of pages 2 through 5 in the <rs type="software">Bing</rs> search 
results. We obtain the inverse Mills ratio, given byλ = λ(zδ) = φ(zδ)/ (zδ) from the 
selection equation, and add this to the second stage to obtain </p>

<p>The second specification in Table III uses navigational searches from <rs type="software">Bing</rs> rather 
than Google to measure brand equity. Because <rs type="software">Bing</rs> has a different population of users 
and employs a different algorithm for returning search results, it is unlikely that un-
observed factors that affect clicks on Google are correlated with this measure of brand 
equity based on navigational searches on Bing. The results in column (2) show that our 
findings are robust to using this alternative measure of brand equity. 
The final specification in Table III is based on an alternative measure of brand equity 
pioneered by Animesh et al. (2010). This measure is constructed from data produced by 
the Web traffic reporting firm, Alexa, and measures the "Sites Linking In." It is based on 
the number of links to a web site from sites that are visited by individuals on Alexa's 
Web traffic panel. 
20 Animesh et al. use these data to measure seller quality, noting that 
links pointing to a web site can be viewed as a positive recommendation from the 
referring site. As shown in column (3) of Table III, our results are also robust to using 
this alternative measure of brand equity-as well as to interpreting the brand equity 
effect identified in our earlier results as purely capturing "seller quality." </p>

<p>tions about the workers' opinions and their perceptions 
about the exposure to occupational risks (noise, chemi-
cals, vibration, bad microclimate, insuffi cient lighting, 
and ergonomics), experienced health symptoms and 
their awareness of the Occupational Health and Safety 
Act were also asked. The workers were randomly se-
lected from textile, printing, mechanical, plastic, food 
processing industries and offi ces. A questionnaire was 
distributed to 412 workers in investigated industries. 
The average age was 43.6 years. Confi dentiality of 
information was always maintained and only coded 
information was used in the analysis. Data collected 
on the questionnaire study was coded and then en-
tered into the statistical software programme (<rs type="software">Excel</rs>) 
for analyses. The investigation gave results as follows: 
1. 65% of workers considered excessive exposure 
to noise, 60% bad microclimate (too cold work-
rooms), 54% bad lighting at workplaces; not-ef-
fective ventilation was the main occupational risk 
factor (75% of workplaces). 
2. Only some of the workers (10%) answered that 
they know which information about the danger-
ousness of chemicals may be obtained from the 
chemical labels. Nobody of respondents pointed 
at the chemical safety data sheets as one of the 
important source of information. 
3. Most of the workers (80%) reported that personal 
protective equipment (PPE) was accessible; how-
ever, the questionnaire did not show the attitudes 
towards using PPE. Some of the respondents 
(36%) pointed that the PPE disturbs the work; 
others mentioned (46%) that the quality of PPE is 
not very good. 
4. In the present study, 63% of the workers reported 
that they were aware of the person who was the 
working environment specialist in their company. 
At the same time, only 20% of workers knew who 
was elected to be their working environment rep-
resentative. 
5. Different opinions were given on safety instruc-
tions and guidelines. In the present study, 25% of 
the workers reported that they had not received 
safety instructions and guidelines. The assessment 
of the safety instructions was made on a 6-point 
scale (from 0 to 5, where 0 was bad and 5 -very 
good). According to workers' opinion, the quality 
of accessed safety instruction was satisfactory (2.8 
points). 
6. The questionnaire revealed that only 25% were 
generally aware of the safety legislation. </p>

<p>We initiated a comparative microarray-based genomic analysis 
of purified GM-CSF bm-CD11 + DCs differentiated or not in the 
presence of IL-4 to identify a transcriptional program capable of 
enhancing endosomes and/or autophagosomes dynamics. Prin-
cipal component (PC) analysis (PCA) showed a close proximity 
of replicates (Fig. 5 A) with a clear partitioning of each exper-
imental condition tested. PC1, corresponding to ''LPS versus 
nonactivated (con),'' represented 49% of the overall variability 
between microarrays. PC2, corresponding to ''IL-4 treatment,'' 
accounted for 22%, suggesting that LPS activation dominated 
the overall DC differential gene expression program. However, 
IL-4 treatment induced a specific response only moderately 
affected by LPS. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
selected on statistical significance (P &lt; 0.1) and a fold change 
above 2 for up-regulated genes (Fig. 5 B) and below 0.33 for 
down-regulated genes (Fig. S5). After clustering and heat map 
representation of the top regulated genes, resistin-like-α, Ccl24, 
and arginase 1 were found to be the most up-regulated by 
IL-4, as previously described in macrophages (Van Dyken and 
Locksley, 2013). Venn diagrams showed that out of all probes 
tested, 187 DEGs defined a core IL-4 differential gene expres-
sion signature (Table S1). DEGs were submitted to two differ-
ent pathway analyses, <rs type="software">Voronto</rs> and <rs type="software">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
(IPA</rs>) softwares. <rs type="software">Voronto</rs> uses tessellation Voronoi diagrams to 
integrate expression data and hierarchical ontologies extracted 
from public databases (Santamaría and Pierre, 2012). The most 
significant pathways induced by IL-4 were linked to amino acid 
and lipid metabolisms as well as chemokine signaling. <rs type="software">IPA</rs> iden-
tified the IL-4 signature list as constituted of immunologically 
relevant genes because top pathways were identified as inflam-
matory or immunological diseases. IL-4 was identified as the 
top predicted upstream regulator followed closely by IL-13 and 
STAT6, confirming the pertinence of our analysis. This predic-
tion was mostly influenced by genes representing the hallmark 
of alternative versus classical macrophage activation, including 
Arginase 1 and anti-nematode and -fungal resistance genes such 
as chitinases (e.g., Chi3l4) and RNases (e.g., Ear11). When im-
munologically relevant genes were examined, mRNA levels of 
chemokines CCL24, CCL22, and IL-6 were all significantly </p>

were used to classify samples according to the similarity of their gene 
expression profiles as assessed by hierarchical clustering with average

distance, considering the genes having a minimal fold change of two 
across all samples. PCA was computed with the <rs type="software">MeV</rs> software across 
all probes, using the median-centered method and 10 neighbors for 
KNN imputation. The 3D plot was generated using the scatterplot3D 
package in the R statistical environment. Genes differentially expressed 
between each sample in a statistically significant manner were selected 
as having a fold change &gt;2× and an FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg correc-

<p>In particular, previously unpublished data from 2010 suggests 
that food sharing may require social bonds that require devel-
opment over long periods of time. In Trinidad, we captured 5 
females at 5 sites that were 20-90 km apart. We conducted 3 
separate food-sharing experiments to see if these previously unfa-
miliar individuals would begin sharing food after being kept in 
captivity together for several weeks. To assess changes in allog-
rooming over time, we also conducted random focal sampling 
of allogrooming. We ranked the amount of time each bat spent 
grooming others, then tested whether the mean ranks across bats 
increased over time using a permutation test (<rs type="software">lmPerm package</rs> 
in R). We never observed food sharing, but we found that bats 
began begging others on the second and third sets of fasting tri-
als on days 21 and 36 (Table 1). We also found that allogroom-
ing increased over time among the previously unfamiliar bats 
[R 
2 = 0.45, F(1,10) = 8.3, p = 0.018]. 
We conducted other trials with groups of female common 
vampire bats that may have been previously familiar. Two groups 
in Trinidad and Belize were captured flying in close proximity 
(in the same mist net within a roughly 5 min period). We tested 
another group of vampire bats captured from the same tree hol-
low in Trinidad, but again with unknown levels of association. 
In all 4 groups (n = 48 fasting trials), we observed some begging 
but no food sharing. </p>

<p>The lateral projections of the lumbosacral spine 
ra diographs were evaluated. The criteria for normality of 
the radiographs were as follows: 
1. Presence of five lumbar and five sacral vertebrae 
2. Progressive increase in vertebral height from L 1 to L 5 
3. Preservation of lumbar lordosis 
4. Posterior margins of the lumbar vertebral bodies form a 
smooth curved line 
5. Intervertebral disc spaces increase in thickness from 
L 1 to L 5 
6. No radiographic evidence of congenital abnormality or 
disease. 
The lumbosacral angles measured using an x-ray viewing 
box and a transparent goniometer included the following: 
1. LSA: the angle between the sacral base and the horizontal 
plane (Figure 1A) 
2. SIA: the angle between a vertical plane and a tangential 
line to the posterior border of S I vertebra (Figure 1B) 
3. LSDA: the angle formed by the intersection of two lines 
drawn through the inferior end plate of L 5 and the superior 
end plate of S 1 (Figure 1C)

Statistical analysis was done using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 17.0</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA</rs>). Prior to analysis, we verified 
the normality of continuous variables distributions and tested 
the homogeneity of their variances with the Levene's test. 
Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard 
deviation. Comparison of means of both sets of data was done </p>

<p>Time-horizon 
A 120-month (10-year) time-horizon was chosen in order to 
mitigate inherent uncertainty in the extrapolation of 34-month 
OS data over a lifetime-horizon. The 10-year time-horizon 
was deemed both sufficient to capture meaningful differences 
in OS and appropriate from an economic perspective since, 
according to published data, only 10% of patients with RR-
DCT survive at 10 years. 
1 The restricted mean, truncated at 
the 10-year time-horizon, was used to facilitate estimates of 
OS before and after the empirical data cutoff (at 34 months), 
while the extended mean was used to estimate CIs around the 
marginal OS difference. The uncertainty around the estimates 
was measured using the bootstrap method 
15 to evaluate the 
CIs. All statistical analyses were performed in <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA Version 
13</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA</rs>). </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis. Statistical significance between two groups was deter-
mined by the Welch's t test using two-tailed analysis to obtain p-values. The 
Log-Rank test was used to compare the survival of mice across tumor trans-
plantation or induction conditions. Error bars are depicted using the <rs type="software">SEM</rs>. 
All experiments were done at least twice. </p>

<p>For the purposes of statistical evaluation, the 
post-hoc ANOVA test of <rs type="software">Statistica v. 10</rs> was used. 
Statistically significant results were those for which 
p &lt; 0.05. They are highlighted in red in Table II. 
What can be clearly observed when analyzing the 
scores in the first column is that the frequency of 
occurrence of lymphatic leakage is statistically sig-
nificant in comparison to TAVI with the emergency 
EVAR procedure, and then with femoropopliteal by-
pass graft surgery, femoral embolectomy, profundo-
plasty, and pseudoaneurysm. The second column 
contains a comparison of results between patients 
who underwent planned endovascular surgery due 
to an abdominal aorta aneurysm and other surgical 
procedures. As above, these scores are statistical-
ly significant for similar groups of patients, except 
the patients after femoral embolectomy, where no 
statistical significance was determined (p = 0.084). 
The third column presents a comparison of results 
in relation to an emergency EVAR procedure. In such 
a perspective, statistical significance only emerged 
for the comparison with the TAVI procedure and fas-
cial closure. In the remaining pairs, this significance 
was not detected. Comparing the TEVAR procedure 
with other procedures, statistical significance only 
occurred in relation to the femoral artery pseu-
doaneurysm surgical procedure, where p = 0.008. 
A comparison between the emergency TEVAR pro-
cedure and all other types of procedures included 
in the study and presented in column 5 indicated 
statistical significance only when compared to fas-
cial closure (p = 0.035). The sixth column contains 
scores for patients operated on due to AAD relative 
to other groups. Statistical significance was demon-
strated only for a pair-wise comparison with pseu-
doaneurysm surgery. Column 7 shows a comparison 
between planned classical AAA treatment results 
with the remaining types of surgery. In this case, sta-</p>

<p>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
The mRNA expression levels of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) 
and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were determined by 
RT-PCR. Briefly, SK-N-SH cells were treated as mentioned 
above, and the total RNA of each group was extracted using 
TRIzol agent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA was first reverse 
transcribed into cDNA, and then routine PCR was performed 
as previously described (22). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control and 
products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel. <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageJ</rs> software </p>

<p>(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">NIH</rs>, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to quantify the optical 
density value of each band. The sequences of specific primers 
(Sangon Biotech Inc., Shanghai, China) used for RT-PCR are 
listed in Table I. </p>

<p>Western blot analysis. Cells were collected at 24 h after expo-
sure to H 2 O 2 . In order to detect the expression of Bcl-2 and 
Bax, SK-N-SH cells were washed with PBS and lysed using 
a lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 
16,000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C, and the supernatant was saved 
for the total protein determination. Protein concentrations 
were determined using a commercially available BCA protein 
assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). For western blot analysis, 
equivalent amounts of protein of each sample (20 µg) were 
electrophoresed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to polyvinyl-
idene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). 
After the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk 
in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature, 
primary antibodies (in TBST-5% BSA) against Bcl-2 (1:2,000; 
12789-1-AP) and Bax (1:5,000; 60267-1-Ig) (both from 
ProteinTech Group Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) were added and 
incubated overnight at 4˚C for determining signal transduction 
events. The membranes were rinsed three times with TBST 
and incubated with an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary 
antibody (1:2,000; #04-15-06 and #04-18-06) (both from 
KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 1 h at 37˚C. An ECL kit 
(Millipore) was used to visualize membrane immunoreactivity. 
Quantification was performed using a computerized imaging 
program <rs id="software-1" type="software">Quantity One</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Bio-Rad</rs>, Hercules, CA, USA). </p>

<p><rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs><rs type="software">Google 
Scholar</rs>search for biomarker signatures in cancer. For about a decade, 
scientists have scoured high-throughput data to find collec-
tions of genes or proteins that can be used in diagnosis or 
prognosis of cancer. However, the tools used to find signatures 
in massive data sets can yield spurious associations with 
phenotype (Ioannidis, 2005), even when the results appear 
to be statistically sound in self-assessment. In most cases, 
unfortunately, these signatures do not generalize; taken to 
the task of showing the diagnostics or prognostics value 
of these signatures, the accuracy of the predictions is much 
poorer on impartial assessments on previously unseen patients 
than on the original data. This problem with cancer signatures 
is of sufficient general interest to be highlighted recently in the 
popular media (Kolata, 2011). 
In order to alleviate the overestimation of accuracy from the 
many bias sources described above, we proposed a few guidelines: </p>

<p>analyses were performed using R version 3.1 using the packages <rs type="software">rms</rs> 
and <rs type="software">Hmisc</rs>. </p>

<p>Statistical significance was set at 0.05. The 
statistical software used were <rs type="software">Winsteps</rs> for Rasch 
analyses and <rs id="software-1" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">11</rs>. </p>

<p>PBMC were cultured as described in Human cells and left unstimulated or 
were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-12 for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated with 
the RNeasy Midi kit (QIAGEN). For microarray analysis, samples were fur-
ther purifi ed with Trizol (Invitrogen), followed by use of the RNeasy Mini 
kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer ' s protocols. Biotin-labeled 
cRNA was synthesized using the High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit 
(BioArray; Enzo Biochem, Inc.) and hybridized to human genome U133A 
and U133B microarray chips according to the manufacturer ' s instructions 
(Aff ymetrix). Data from unstimulated or IL-12 -stimulated PBMC from seven 
human donors were obtained. <rs type="software">MAS5</rs> software (Aff ymetrix) was used to ana-
lyze the images from each human genome U133A and U133B GeneChip 
Array and to obtain expression values for each probe set along with corre-
sponding calls of present, marginal, or absent. Genes were judged to be signifi -
cantly up-regulated if the expression levels for a least one corresponding probe 
set (as determined by Entrez Gene identifi ers) satisfi ed the following three cri-
teria: (1) a p-value of ≤ 0.05 from the right-tailed paired Student ' s t test on the 
log of the stimulated and control expression levels; (2) a geometric mean fold 
change of ≥ 1.7; and (3) at most, one of the calls for the stimulated expression 
levels failed to be present. <rs type="software">Custom</rs> software written in the Interactive Data 
Language (IDL; ITT Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO) was used to 
conduct this analysis. The data discussed in this publication have been depos-
ited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information ' s Gene Expression 
Omnibus and are accessible through the GEO Series accession no. GSE12839 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE12839). </p>

<p>H NMR spectra were corrected manually for phase and baseline 
distortion and referenced to the chemical shift of the CH 3 resonance of 
alanine at d 1.466 for plasma and liver samples, to the TSP resonance 
of alanine at d 0.0 for urine and fecal samples using <rs id="software-0" type="software">XwinNMR</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.5</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Bruker Biospin</rs>, Rheinstetten, Germany). The spectra were converted 
into 22K data points over the range of d 0.2-10.0 using an in-house 
developed <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> routine. The regions containing the water 
resonance (d 4.5-5.19), and for urine urea resonance (d 4.5-6.2), 
were removed. Chemical shift intensities were normalized to the sum 
of all intensities within the specified range before chemometric 
analysis. 
UPLC-MS data were processed using the Micromass MarkerLynxt 
applications manager Version 4.0 (Waters Corp, Milford, USA). The 
peaks of bile acids were identified by comparing the m/z ratio and 
retention time to the set of standard bile acids measured under the 
same conditions. Data were noise-reduced in both of the UPLC and MS 
domains using <rs type="software">MarkerLynx</rs> standard routines. Integration of the 
UPLC-MS bile acid peaks was performed using <rs type="software">ApexTrack2</rs>t. Each 
peak integral was expressed as a ratio to the sum of integrals of the 21 
measured bile acids. 
The multivariate pattern recognition techniques used in this study 
were based on PCA (Wold et al, 1987), H-PCA (Westerhuis et al, 1998) 
and the orthogonal-projection to latent structure (O-PLS) (Trygg and 
Wold, 2003). PCA was carried out using the <rs id="software-5" type="software">SIMCA-P</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">11</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Umetrics</rs>, Umeå, Sweden) in order to detect the presence of inherent 
similarities between metabolic profiles. Both NMR and LC-MS 
variables were subjected to Pareto scaling, by dividing each variable 
by the square root of its standard deviation. Data were visualized by 
means of principal component scores and loadings plots. Each point in 
the scores plot represents an individual biochemical profile of a 
sample, whereas on the loadings plot each coordinate represents a 
single NMR spectral region or LC-MS retention time and mass to 
charge ratio (m/z). Because the scores and loadings plots are 
complementary, biochemical components responsible for the differ-
ences between samples detected in the scores plot can be extracted 
from the corresponding loadings plot. 
O-PLS-DA was also carried out using the method developed by Trygg 
et al (Trygg and Wold, 2003) and implemented for NMR spectral data 
by Cloarec et al (2005b) to exclusively focus on the effects of probiotic 
supplementation. All O-PLS-DA models were constructed using one 
predictive and two orthogonal components using data scaled to unit 
variance (i.e. by dividing each variable by its standard deviation). 
Here, the test for the significance of the Pearson product-moment 
correlation coefficient was used to calculate the cut-off value of the 
correlation coefficients at the level of Po0.05. To test the validity of 
the model against over-fitting, the cross-validation parameter Q </p>

In the current study, the PCPT risk calculation was performed using 
the available formula. 
9 PSA was also used as a reference prediction tool 
in our analysis. The high-grade PCa was defined as PCa with a Gleason 
Score ≥8 according to the Chinese Urological Association (CUA) 
guideline. 
12 Evaluation of the PCPT risk calculator was excluded 
in high-grade PCa in the criteria for high-grade PCa in the CUA 
guidelines 
12 and EAU (European Association of Urology) guidelines. 
Since the epidemiological database was not well established in China, the 
risk factor of family history in PCPT risk calculator was ignored in the 
analysis. The baseline characteristics (age, prostate volume, logPSA, and 
%fPSA) between two cohorts were compared using t-test for continuous 
variables or Chi-squared test for categorical variables (DRE result, 
TRUS result, and PCa detection rate under 6-or 10-core). Z-test was 
performed to evaluate the differences among area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the two risk calculators, 
PCPT risk calculator and PSA. Two-sided test with P = 0.05 was used.

<p><rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs><rs id="software-2" type="software">Stata 
SE/MP</rs><rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">Version 11</rs><rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs>For many years, social scientists the world over 
have been using large-scale, longitudinal data-
sets that are available to them to answer 
research-driven questions using evidence-
based analyses. This was first started in 1968 
on a large scale with the American Panel Study 
of Income Dynamics (PSID), housed at the 
University of Michigan. Indeed, this dataset 
continues to provide invaluable data on gen-
erations of individuals in households concern-
ing topics, such as educational attainment, 
housing situations and income and employment 
dynamics, and was described in detail by Hill 
(1991). 
Following the US lead, in 1984 the German 
Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) was 
established at the German Institute for Eco-
nomic Research in Berlin, Germany. It built 
upon many ideas that had been established in 
the American PSID and introduced a hierarchi-
cal data structure to manage the complicated 
data at different levels, such as person, 
household, roster and sampled and over time. 
This structure is documented in Haisken-
DeNew and Frick (2005). In 1991, the British 
Household Panel Study (BHPS) was intro-
duced to cover the population of Great Britain. 
Taylor et al. (2010) document this study 
in many hundreds of pages of detailed 
information. 
Following the tradition of their American, 
German and British counterparts, in 2001 the 
Australian household panel dataset, House-
hold, Income and Labour Dynamics in 
Australia (HILDA) Survey, was released for 
the first time for academic and government use. </p>

<p>previously ('i' wave) is called deterministically 
iwscmg. By adding a wave indicator, a broad 
category indicator and 'speaking names', 
the HILDA Survey's variable names are 
moderately identifiable in content, even if 
one has never seen the specific question or 
questionnaire before. Clearly, data structure 
and variable-naming schemes have evolved 
over time. 
However, no previous dataset has changed 
its data structures or naming schemes to keep up 
with international longitudinal dataset 'best 
practice'. If one could have a tool to find the 
common denominators of the various panel 
datasets and create a simple, yet effective, 
manner of dealing with all datasets in the same 
way, then this would be useful to researchers of 
all datasets, especially those interested in 
comparative research. Indeed, the creators of 
the Cross-National Equivalent File, run out of 
Cornell University, New York, were faced 
immediately with this issue, as they attempted 
to deal with data from the American PSID, 
German SOEP, British BHPS and Australian 
HILDA Survey. The common redefining of 
variable names and content is described in Frick 
et al. (2007). 
Although the Australian HILDA Survey was 
the first large-scale, longitudinal dataset to 
establish itself in Australia, there are now many 
more datasets, as described in Table 1, address-
ing populations such as children in Australia, 
Aboriginal children, youths, recent immigrants, 
doctors and the homeless. All of the datasets 
have different instruments or questionnaires, 
different data structures and variable-naming 
schemes and little has changed since Haisken-
DeNew (2001). Thus, left alone, each dataset 
would require substantial investment in under-
standing the dataset before one could start to do 
any analyses. 
One software solution to the many of the 
issues raised here is a tool called '<rs id="software-4" type="software">PanelWhiz</rs>' 
&lt;<rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">http://www.panelwhiz.com</rs>&gt;, which is writ-
ten in and for the statistical package called <rs id="software-5" type="software">Stata</rs> 
&lt;<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.stata.com</rs>&gt;. For the German 
SOEP, its functionality is summarised in 
Haisken-DeNew and Hahn (2010). <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> 
was initially developed to deal specifically with 
the complexity of the German SOEP structure </p>

<p>on variable naming, but has since expanded to 
cover all of the world's major household panel 
datasets. 
<rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> is a graphical user interface that 
allows users to extract data from known 
datasets in a controlled manner, without having 
to write data extraction code oneself. The 
structure of the data is in fact embedded into the 
data itself and is called up and read by 
<rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> to allow it to use this structure 
automatically, without the user having to 
delve further in the data structure. In terms 
of the amount of <rs type="software">Stata</rs> programming code, it 
is the largest-ever user-written collection of 
add-ons for <rs type="software">Stata</rs>. <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> provides in 
<rs type="software">Stata</rs> an analogous platform to what the 
<rs type="software">Integrated Public Use Microdata Series</rs> (for 
more information, see Minnesota Population 
Center 2001) does at the browser level. This 
article outlines the features of <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> in 
conjunction with Australian datasets that are 
listed in Table 1. </p>

<p>The obvious advantage of using <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> is 
the power of the common interface. Every 
survey supported by <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs>, regardless of 
original structure, is integrated into the system 
in a similar manner. The entire dataset is 
scanned for critical pieces of information: 
(i) which physical data files belong together 
in a data year; (ii) variable names and how they 
correspond to each other over time; and (iii) 
keywords associated with variable labels. 
In contrast to standard statistical software, 
one does not open a data file and select one 
single variable, but rather one can select an 
entire vector of variables belonging to each 
other. As all words used in variable labels are 
scanned, one can compile a total list of all used 
words from the labels and create an index of 
keywords or dictionary, linking each known 
keyword to a particular variable, which in turn 
can be related to an entire vector of variables 
which belong together over time.°C </p>

<p>To start off, one selects the dataset of interest 
(in this case, HILDA Survey). Assuming that 
one were to start a data project from scratch, as 
in Figure 1, one would first be interested in 
opening either a specific wave or a keyword list. 
Here, we will examine a specific wave. The 
HILDA Survey contains information from 
2001 to 2011, and correspondingly, there are 
clickable links for each year's wave. A browse 
page is created when clicking on a year. 
However, many datasets contain thousands of 
variables, making the creation of browse pages 
a relatively slow process. <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> creates a 
browse page once when needed, and if the page 
already exists, <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> simply uses it. The 
browse page is valid for a given distribution of 
data. It may become necessary to delete and 
recreate the browse pages if, for instance, there 
is a new release or revised version of the data. 
In Figure 1, we select the 2010 wave [j -
2010]. In the HILDA Survey, for the 'j' wave 
(or 2010), the respondent is asked whether he 
has a long-term health condition, as indicated 
by the variable jhelth in Figure 2. However, one </p>

<p>can simply click on the 'item' called helth, 
which would represent all the years' informa-
tion from wave 'a' to wave 'k'. 
If one were to click on 'N' (that is, notes), one 
would see the following vector of variables in 
Figure 3, all associated with the item called 
'helth'. Clicking on 'S' would produce summary 
statistics and 'T' would produce tabulations. 
All words used in item labels become part of 
the keyword dictionary and can be searched. 
Thus, searching or clicking on the word 'unable' 
would produce output like in Figure 4. PanelWhiz 
would list all items having the word 'unable' in 
the item label. Items could then be immediately 
selected, regardless of the wave or year. 
After having selected several items and 
having stored the <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> project under a 
name, such as 'myproject', the Project Page 
would look something like in Figure 5. 
The items selected would be sorted by their 
categories, such as 'AN' for 'Ancestry'. Add-
ing any new items to the project would create 
additional entries in the Project Page. Here, in 
this particular view of the Project Page, we see </p>

<p>the underlying variable names associated with 
each item. Thus, the variable in 2002 bancob is 
the 2002 ('b' wave) entry for the item ancob. 
By clicking on 'Retrieval', the data retrieval 
is started. File by file, the data files are opened, 
the selected variables are kept and possibly 
renamed, sub-sets of the files are stored in 
temporary files and then they are pieced 
together to create one rectangularised file in 
<rs type="software">Stata</rs> 'long' format (observations stacked on 
each other, year by year). </p>

<p><rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> is a tool written entirely in <rs type="software">Stata</rs>'s 
own programming language, which facilitates 
easy data extraction using a graphical user 
interface. Users are not required to write data 
retrieval programs, as <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> generates and 
runs extraction code on the fly, based on the 
variables selected. Due to its common interface 
and implementation for many datasets, it is 
useful for international comparative work and 
allows for an easy introduction to a new dataset 
for first-time users. As the data retrievals are 
standardised and used by many researchers, the 
chance of mistakes in the initial data-creation 
phase of any research is virtually reduced to 
zero. Updates to <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> are pushed to users 
and are installed in the same manner as <rs type="software">Stata</rs> 
itself. <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> currently has more than 300 
users and currently supports international data-
sets such as the German SOEP, the British BHPS 
(or its successor, the UK Understanding Society 
study), the American PSID and Current Popula-
tion Survey-National Bureau of Economic 
Research, the American Survey of Income and 
Program Participation, the South African Na-
tional Income Dynamics Study, in addition to 
the HILDA Survey, MABEL, LSAC, LSIC and 
CASiE. <rs type="software">PanelWhiz</rs> runs in Windows, Mac and 
Linux, but needs at least <rs id="software-28" type="software">Stata SE/MP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-28" type="version-number">11</rs> or later 
to run. </p>

<p>Assessment of nutritional status 
Participants' nutritional status was assayed by a three-day 
food records. Subjects were advised to record all foods and 
beverages consumed throughout the day for two days of the 
week and one day of the weekend. According to the guideline 
of food portion size [21], amount of each dietary item they 
consumed was expressed in gram. Then these data were analyzed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Nutritionist</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">IV</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">First Databank</rs>, San Bruno, CA, 
USA) modified for Iranian foods and daily intakes of energy and 
some nutrients were obtained. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
All analyses were performed based on Intention To Treat 
principle. The Statistical <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> software program (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 11.5</rs>; 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL) was used for all the statistical analyses. 
The data were checked for normality using Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test. Presentation of data was as mean (standard 
deviation), median (percentile 25, percentile 75) and frequency 
(percentage). Baseline indices were compared in vitamin K 
group versus placebo group to examine if the randomization 
was appropriate. Independent sample-t test, Mann-Whitney U 
test and Fisher exact test were used to compare baseline values 
between two groups. In order to determination the effects of 
treatment at the end of intervention, relevant confounders .i.e; 
duration of RA, energy intake, weight, prothrombin time and 
baseline values were adjusted (ANCOVA test). 
Moreover, in order to assay differences between before and 
after intervention within groups, Paired sample-t test, Wilcoxon 
Signed Ranks and Sign test were used [27-29]. Statistical 
significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. </p>

<p>Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics of patients 
who did and did not develop SSIs were compared using chi-
square tests; Fisher's exact tests were used when low expected 
cell counts were observed. Multivariable logistic regression was 
used to determine patient characteristics independently predic-
tive of 30-day SSIs and to assess the difference in likelihood of 
SSIs at our institution compared to other institutions in the 
ACS-NSQIP database. Results were considered significant if P-
values were less than 0.05. Patient characteristics that resulted in 
a P &lt; 0.05 in the univariate analysis or that were deemed to be 
clinically relevant were included in the multivariable logistic re-
gression model as independent variables, with the SSI rate as 
the dependent variable. Statistical analyses were performed in 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., Cary, NC, USA). </p>

<p>The enrolled children were divided into two groups de-
pending on whether complications due to VZV infection 
were present, and demographic, clinical, and laboratory char-
acteristics were compared between the two groups. 
Categorical factors were compared between the two groups 
using the χ 
2 test, and continuous factors were compared 
using the Mann-Whitney test. Statistical analysis was per-

(CDM) is located in a functionally important part of the CO 
promoter and that this segment is required for full accelera-
tion of flowering in LDs. Whether a fusion of the proximal 
0.6 kb of CO promoter to GFP:CO is sufficient to cause earlier 
flowering of co-2 mutants was then examined. However, no 
significant acceleration of flowering of pCO::GFP:CO (0.6 kb) 
co-2 was detected compared with co-2, although this prox-
imal promoter contains the CPM motif (supplementary fig. 
S5D, Supplementary Material online). This promoter comple-
mentation assay indicates that the activity of pCO gradually 
decreases with progressive deletions from 2.6, 2.1, and 0.6 kb 
and only the fragment containing all three conserved regions 
provides full promoter activity. 
The CO promoter evolved in the Brassicaceae and contains 
functionally important conserved sequences that harbor dis-
tinct combinations of cis-elements (figs. 4A and 5 and sup-
plementary fig. S5 and S6, Supplementary Material online). To 
identify cis-element motifs associated with CO expression 
pattern, 6-10 bp motifs overrepresented in the ten 
Brassicaceae CO promoters were sought using the Multiple 
Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) tool (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Bailey</rs> et al. 2009). The 
most enriched sequences (present 73 Â in the ten promoters) 
contain the E-Box (CANNTG, fig. 4D), which is the binding 
site for FLOWERING BHLH (FBH) transcription factors that 
activate CO transcription in A. thaliana (Ito et al. 2012). The </p>

<p>Sequences for protein alignment were either identified by 
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search or pre-
dicted from genomic and cDNA sequencing data (Arabis 
alpina, Ae. arabicum, and C. papaya) and accession numbers 
can be found in supplementary table S2, Supplementary 
Material online. For the phylogenetic analysis of CO promoter, 
intergenic region of CO (including its start codon) and the 
upstream gene COL1 were used for analysis (except for ThCOL 
where no COL1 is present). Arabis alpina CO promoter was 
assembled from short reads identified by BLAST search of the 
preliminary genome assembly (MPIPZ, Cologne). Sequences 
were assembled using <rs id="software-10" type="software">SeqMan Pro</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">DNASTAR Lasergene</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">Version 8.0.2</rs>). CO Promoters from Capsella rubella, 
Nasturtium officinale, and Sisymbrium officinale were ampli-
fied from genomic DNA (kindly provided by Markus Berns, 
MPIPZ, Cologne) using degenerate primers that anchor in 
COL1 and CO, respectively (COL1 Fw: TGACACMGGATATG 
GAATTG; CO Rv: TGGCAGAGTGRACTTGAGCA). The inter-
genic region between COL1 and CO orthologs was subse-
quently sequenced by primer walk. The CO promoter of 
Ae. arabicum was identified by BAC (bacterial artificial chro-
mosome) screen using an CO probe (BAC probe Fw: ACTGGT 
GGTGGATCAAGAGG; Rv: TCTTGGGTGTGAAGCTGTTG) 
and sequenced by primer walk from two independent 
BACs. Accession numbers for CO promoters used in the 
alignment can be found in supplementary table S3, 
Supplementary Material online. For the comparison of cis-
element composition, 5 
0 -sequences (4,000 bp including the </p>

Accession numbers are given in supplementary table S4,

cum, whole loci sequences paired-end next generation 
sequencing reads of Ae. arabicum genomic sequence

the indicated genes. Cis-elements were counted using custo-
mized Perl script (supplementary material, Supplementary

to VCF file by <rs id="software-15" type="software">VCF Tools</rs> <rs corresp="#software-15" type="version-number">0.1.10</rs> [16]. For detecting somatic 
mutation candidates, we obtained the difference in VCF files 
between tumor and normal samples. For annotation of these 
somatic mutation candidates, we used the ANNOVAR tool 
[17]. </p>

<p>The most frequently mutated genes across all samples 
were USP9Y and MUC5B; these genes were mutated in 5 
samples. These genes were also highly mutated in each 
sample; for USP9Y genes, it had 6 nonsynonymous muta-
tions in sample 3. We have selected 45 highly mutated genes 
(1.5%) from 2981 mutated genes. We defined highly mu-
tated genes as genes having 3 or more nonsynonymous 
mutations in each sample (Table 3). In a comparison of 
mutations with the <rs type="software">COSMIC</rs> database [19], among 45 
highly mutated genes, 21 genes matched to hematopoietic 
and lymphoid tissue malignancy terms, and 21 genes 
matched to other cancer types. In 3 genes, there was no 
matched term in <rs type="software">COSMIC</rs> (Table 4). 
We used the concept lattice to construct the hierarchical 
relationship between the samples that had 45 highly 
mutated genes. Concept Biolattice analysis is a mathe-
matical framework based on concept lattice analysis for 
better biological interpretation of genomic data. The top 
element of a lattice is a unit concept, representing a concept 
that contains all objects. The bottom element is a zero 
concept having no object [20, 21]. For comparing with the 
Concept lattice (Fig. 5), we also performed hierarchical 
clustering analysis by Ward method. In hierarchical clus-
tering, cluster 1 has 5 samples (nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, and 10), 
cluster 2 has 2 samples (nos. 4 and 7), and others have 1 
sample each (Fig. 6). We divided the samples into 4 
subgroups by interpretation of the concept lattice result (Fig. 
7). Lattice subgroup 1 shared SYNE1 gene mutation, and 
samples 3, 4, and 7 were included in this subgroup. 
Subgroup 2 was comprised of 5 samples (nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, and 
9) that had MUC5 gene mutations in common. Samples 10 
and 8 could be isolated by the uniqueness of their mutated </p>

<p>Matrix-free LDI MS detection and imaging. The lipid molecules were initially 
dissolved in chloroform and ethanol was used for AONB at a concentration of 1 mg/ 
mL and then diluted in a step wise manner. To perform to MS detection, typically 
0.4 mL of the diluted solution was directly deposited on the paper or NALDI 
TM plate 
(Bruker Daltonics), for MS analysis on Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III Smartbeam. For 
the standard matrix assisted detection, 0.4 mL of sample solution was mixed with 1 mL 
of CHCA matrix (10 mg/mL, in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid, 
50549.950.1%, v/v/v) and dried on the commercial MALDI plate (MPT 384 plain 
steel) before MS analysis. All mass spectra were obtained in the RP-HPC-Proteomics 
mode via an accumulation of 500 laser shots under a laser intensity of 36% for data 
collection and calibrated using an auto calibration method. Two standard peptides, 
Angiotensin II (M.W. 1046.5) and ACTH-Clip (M.W. 2465.7), were used for 
calibration to reduce variability. No smoothing of spectra was applied. In the imaging 
experiments, the stamp with laser engraved letters pattern was first fabricated and 
immersed into a DOTAP solution at a concentration of 1 ng/mL. The stamp was 
pressed to the paper substrate separately and then the stamped paper was loaded into 
the MS chamber for imaging. Matrix-free mass spectrometry imaging was performed 
on the Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III mass analyzer system in positive reflector mode. 
In the imaging set up, the spot-to-spot distance was set to be 50 mm and 50 laser shots 
were taken with laser intensity of 36% at each spot. The nitrogen laser (337 nm) was 
applied at a repetition rate of 200 Hz. A full mass spectrum ranging from 200 to 
2000 m/z was acquired for every pixel at an x-y step-size of 50 mm. Imaging data was 
stored in the FlexImaging data format (Bruker Bioscience). <rs type="software">2D image construction 
and statistical analysis were executed using custom-made scripts in the FlexImaging 
software (Bruker Biosicence, AUS</rs>). Peak finding and integration was performed for 
each pixel to select peaks at specific m/z of 380 and 662. Peaks were integrated using a 
0.3 Da window.

by dividing the actual weight into the ME and multiply-
ing by 100. Root mean square error (RMSE) was calcu-
lated by taking the square root of the average squared 
error. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 
determined using a 2-way random effects model and an

<rs corresp="#software-10" type="url">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</rs>)]. The following pre-processing was ap-
plied: motion correction using <rs type="software">MCFLIRT</rs> [Motion Correction: FMRIB3s 
Linear Image Registration Tool (Jenkinson et al., 2002)], slice-timing 
correction using Fourier-space time-series phase-shifting; non-brain re-
moval using the <rs type="software">Brain Extraction Tool</rs> (Smith, 2002), spatial smoothing 
using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 6.0 mm; high-pass temporal filtering 
(Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with sigma = 
50.0 s). Registration of fMRI data to high-resolution structural and 
standard-space images was carried out using <rs type="software">FLIRT</rs> [FMRIB3s Linear 
Image Registration Tool (Jenkinson et al., 2002; Jenkinson and Smith, 
2001)]. Because patient movement was minimal (b3 mm) in most pa-
tients, motion parameters were not included as regressors since motion 
correction via <rs type="software">MCFLIRT</rs> [Motion Correction: FMRIB3s Linear Image Reg-
istration Tool (Jenkinson et al., 2002)] sufficiently minimized any mo-
tion effects. 
The binary timing of interictal discharges was convolved with multi-
ple hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) with time-to-peak rang-
ing from 0-13 s, similar to the methodology employed for scalp EEG-
fMRI analyses by other groups (Bagshaw et al., 2004; Kobayashi et al., 
2006a; Kobayashi et al., 2006b). The generated model was imported 
into FEAT where a time-series statistical analysis was carried out using 
<rs type="software">FILM (FMRIB3s Improved Linear Model</rs>) with local autocorrelation cor-
rection for each run (Woolrich et al., 2001). Higher-level analyses 
were performed using a fixed effects model, by forcing the random ef-
fects variance to zero in FLAME (FMRIB3s Local Analysis of Mixed Ef-
fects) (Beckmann et al., 2003; Woolrich et al., 2004; Woolrich, 2008), 
generating a statistical average of all runs. To account for the increased 
probability of Type 1 error through the use of multiple HRFs, 
data were corrected using <rs type="software">AlphaSim</rs> of the <rs id="software-18" type="software">AFNI</rs> analysis package 
<rs corresp="#software-18" type="url">http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/AlphaSim.html</rs> 
that performs both probability and cluster-based thresholding at a sig-
nificance level of p b 0.05, as determined by Monte Carlo simulations 
(Ward, 2000). Locations of the strongest activation were identified as 
the cluster (as determined by AlphaSim) with maximum peak response 
(Z-score). The gamma function time-to-peak for each subject3s maximal 
response was used. Parametric maps were overlaid onto high-
resolution structural images that were registered to MNI standard 
space. 
The BOLD response(s) for each IED was visually evaluated. If 
the BOLD response was within 1 cm of the center of recording 
electrode(s) showing maximal involvement of the IEDs (defined as 
the maximal amplitude in referential montage and/or phase reversal 
in bipolar montage), there was considered to be good concordance 
between BOLD response and the recorded discharges. A significant 
BOLD response in the same lobe as the active electrode was assessed 
as relative concordance, and outside of the same lobe as poor 
concordance. </p>

<p>Independent t-tests were used for comparisons between groups 
and bivariate correlations were used when appropriate. Statistical 
analyses were conducted by using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">17.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">(SPSS, Chicago, IL</rs>) and the values reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). 
Values with P &lt; 0.05 were considered to be significant. </p>

<p>ing was defined as the time from ingestion until pyloric passage, 
the latter identified as a shift from approximately 3 contractions per 
minute (cpm) to 12 cpm, in combination with the characteristic 
2D image of passage through the duodenal arch. As the ingestion 
time for the first dose of oxycodone and ingestion time of the 3D-
Transit capsule was only 15 minutes apart, gastric emptying was 
not analysed in this study, as the short time interval did not allow 
for oxycodone to be sufficiently absorbed and induce OIBD in 
the gastric segment. Small intestinal transit time was defined as the 
time between pyloric passage and ileocecal passage. Ileocecal pas-
sage was identified as a decrease in contraction frequency from 6 
cpm, characteristic of the distal ileum, to 3 cpm, typical of the colon. 
Identification of ileocecal passage was supported by a rapid lateral 
movement in the lower right quadrant. Total colorectal transit time 
was defined as the time between ileocecal passage and expulsion of 
the capsule. 
In order to obtain the segmental transit times of the colon, a 
new method for 3D visualization and determination of the trajectory 
traversed by the magnetic capsule in the colon was developed. The 
raw positional data from the magnetic capsule were pre-processed 
prior to visualization. To enhance visualization of the trajectory, 
samples with considerable noise and artefacts coming from patient 
movement or external noise based on signal strength of the capsule 
and accelerometer data were removed. Additionally, the positional 
data were low-pass filtered using a second order Butterworth filter. 
Samples were then averaged for every 10 minutes providing a more 
uniform trajectory visualization as the capsule may remain in the 
same position within the colon for several hours. 
The algorithms were incorporated into a custom <rs id="software-0" type="software">Matlab</rs>

tection thresholds were baseline-corrected and analysed with two-
way ANOVAs with factors treatment (oxycodone and placebo) and 
day (days 2, 3, 4, and 5). For all ANOVAs, Tukey's post hoc test 
was applied where relevant. Transit time data were non-parametric, 
and are presented as medians and ranges. Wilcoxon signed rank 
test was used to compare segmental transit times during the 2 treat-
ments. Spearman's rho was used to identify associations between 
questionnaire scores and transit times. P-values &lt; 0.05 were con-
sidered significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Stata</rs>

<p>information about the protein is provided: Besides protein 
descriptions and full protein sequences, the corresponding 
<rs type="software">Gene Ontology</rs> identifiers (18) are listed linking to the 
<rs type="software">Gene Ontology</rs> web site reporting full descriptions of 
the selected annotation. Furthermore, the annotations to 
each instance include PubMed references and general fea-
tures such as active sites, motifs, domains or signaling sites 
derived from SwissProt (Figure 3). Since there may be 
several isoform entries corresponding to one SwissProt 
entry, we BLASTP-aligned the protein sequence of each 
SwissProt instance with that of the corresponding entry of 
the database used for matching the spectra to peptide 
sequence (usually the IPI). The main purpose of this exten-
sive alignment approach is to derive the exact sequence 
positions of relevant protein features that are annotated 
in SwissProt within the protein sequences of the entry of 
the database used for MS identification. 
Proteomics datasets containing quantitative informa-
tion in the form of isotope ratios are becoming the norm 
rather than the exception (19). In this case, the median 
quantitative data of all measured and assigned peptides 
is taken to quantify the protein. 
Additionally, each displayed web page includes a ques-
tion mark button that directs to the help section of MAPU 
2.0 describing the format of the current page or exempli-
fying the web application guideline. These help sections 
are also available via the 'background' section of 
MAPU 2.0, which also contains general descriptions of 
the experimental designs of various projects. </p>

<p>To allow the retrieval of legacy sub-databases that 
could not be included in the new concept, a link to the 
old database version is provided. This is the case for the 
organellar database (20) as well as the red blood cell data-
base (21), as both datasets are exclusively protein-based 
and therefore cannot be mapped to MAPU 2.0 due to the 
lack of peptide information. 
MAPU 2.0 is based on a modern and scalable software 
architecture, namely C# and the <rs type="software">ASP.NET</rs> technology. 
This allows MAPU 2.0 to share class libraries, with 
PHOSIDA (15). The concepts and web applications of 
MAPU 2.0 and PHOSIDA are very similar and show 
that very distinct proteomic databases can be built using 
shared components. </p>

MAPU 2.0 (Figure 4). The user first selects a species of 
interest. The karyotype of the selected species is illustrated 
along with a link that connects to the EnsEMBL genome 
annotation webpage. Clicking of the displayed chromo-
somes generates a more detailed image of the chosen 
chromosome along with general information including 
chromosome length, number of known and predicted 
genes, quantity of occurring single nucleotide polymorph-
isms (SNPs) and number of gene transcripts. Besides these 
annotations, which are derived from the EnsEMBL data-
base, the number of gene transcripts that have been iden-
tified in MAPU 2.0 is indicated. 
Furthermore, each chromosome is divided into 93 bins: 
on the left hand side the number of transcripts annotated 
in <rs type="software">EnsEMBL</rs> is displayed. Selecting one of the bin boxes 
pops up the EnsEMBL web page, showing a detailed view 
of the selected chromosome region. On the right hand 
side, the number of transcripts that have been detected 
in any of the uploaded projects is illustrated for each 
bin. Clicking on one of these bin buttons results in the 
listing of all identified gene transcripts along with the 
descriptions of the corresponding genes and exact locali-
zations on the chromosome. Moreover, a link is provided 
for each gene transcript that connects to the EnsEMBL 
homepage displaying the full annotation of that tran-

All objects were presented in color as single objects on a white back-
ground. Each trial began with a black fixation cross on a white back-
ground for 500 ms before the object was shown for 500 ms, and 
followed by a blank screen lasting between 2400 and 2700 ms. The 
order of stimuli was pseudo-randomized such that consecutive stimuli 
were not phonologically related (i.e., shared an initial phoneme) and 
no more than 4 living or nonliving items could occur in a row. The 
stimuli were presented in 3 blocks. Stimuli were presented using

and object naming accuracy was recorded by the experimenter during 
data acquisition. </p>

<p>pixels. Responses from different layers of the HMax model, the C1 and 
C2 responses, were extracted using the settings described by Serre et al. 
(2005) and precomputed S2 features from natural image fragments 
(downloaded http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/standardmodel). For 
each object, the responses at the 2 layers were extracted separately, and 
C1 and C2 matrices were constructed containing responses for all 302 
objects (C1 matrix dimensions 302 × 28608, C2 matrix dimensions 
302 × 2000). Principal components analyses were then performed on 
each matrix (using the <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> function princomp). The number of 
components used in the final model was determined based on 
maximum model classification performance for data in the time window 
100-300 ms using an independent group of participants performing 
the same task with similar objects (see Clarke et al. 2013). This proced-
ure identified that 12 HMaxC1 components and 6 HMaxC2 compo-
nents resulted in maximum classification accuracy and so these values 
were used in the final set of models (range tested: 1-12, 30, and 50 
components). 
The semantic content of objects was modeled using semantic-
feature norms (McRae et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2012). The feature 
norms contain lists of features associated with a large range of objects 
(e.g., "has 4 legs," "has stripes," and "lives in Africa" are features of a 
"zebra"). As similar concepts have similar features, feature-based models 
capture categorical structure by virtue of feature overlap, while also cap-
turing the properties of a concept that differentiates it from other con-
cepts of the same semantic category, because each concept is composed 
of a unique set of features. Based on the feature norms, each object can 
be represented by a binary vector indicating whether each feature is as-
sociated with the object or not. The 302 objects used in this study were 
associated with 1510 features in total. Modeling semantic content was 
achieved using a binary concept-feature matrix derived from the prop-
erty norms. The matrix had dimensions of 302 concepts by 1510 
features, with cell values of 1 indicating which features are true for 
concepts and 0 in all other cells. A principal components analysis 
was used to reduce the dimensionality of this matrix, and the first 6 
semantic-feature components were selected based on maximum model 
classification performance for the time window 100-300 ms using an 
independent group of participants. </p>

<p>MEG Preprocessing 
Initial processing of the raw data used <rs id="software-2" type="software">MaxFilter</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Elektra-Neuromag</rs>). First, static bad channels were detected that were subse-
quently reconstructed by interpolating neighboring channels, as were 
bad channels containing long periods of high amplitude or noisy 
signals. The temporal extension of the signal-space separation tech-
nique was applied to the data every 4 s to segregate the signals origin-
ating from within the participants' head from those generated by 
external sources of noise, along with head movement compensation 
and transformation of head position to a common head position. An 
artifact removal procedure was applied to the continuous data based 
on independent components analysis (ICA), implemented using 
EEGLab (Delorme and Makeig 2004). Components of the data that 
showed a correlation greater than a Pearson's r of 0.4 with either EOG 
channel were removed from the data. ICA was applied to the magnet-
ometers and gradiometers separately. 
The resulting MEG data were low-pass filtered at 40 Hz in forward 
and reverse directions using a fifth-order Butterworth digital filter, 
epoched from −200 to 600 ms, and downsampled to 100 Hz using 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">SPM</rs><rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">8</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Wellcome Institute of Imaging Neuroscience</rs>, London, UK). 
Items that were incorrectly named were excluded, where an incorrect 
name was defined as a response that did not match the correct 
concept. We did not explicitly account for potential muscle artifacts 
produced by the overt naming task as this should not affect our data 
considering the duration of the epoch examined and frequency range 
included in relation to the typical onset of muscle artifacts and their fre-
quency distribution (mean naming latency: 991 ms, standard deviation 
over participants: 109 ms). Furthermore, any such artifacts are unlikely 
to be confounded with visual or semantic processing in such a way to 
affect classification accuracy or model fit. </p>

<p>Source Localization: Visualizing Regression Coefficients 
To visualize the cortical representation of the regression weights, the 
minimum norm source localization technique was implemented in 
<rs id="software-4" type="software">SPM</rs><rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">8</rs> using the IID option. Instead of using the regression weights 
derived from MEG data averaged over participants (those used for 
model fit and classification), for source localization, we calculated the 
regression weights for each participant separately, that were then used 
as the inputs to the source localization procedure. These individual 
participant localizations were used to provide more accurate source re-
constructions than those that localizing the grand averaged data would 
have produced. Since the regression weights are obtained using linear 
equations with standardized predictors, they can be used for source lo-
calization (Hauk et al. 2006). MRI images were segmented and spatially 
normalized to an MNI template brain in Talairach space. A template 
cortical mesh with 8196 vertices was inverse normalized to the indivi-
dual's specific MRI space. MEG sensor locations were coregistered to 
MRI space using the fiducial and digitized head-points obtained during </p>

<p>acquisition. The forward model was created using the single shell 
option to calculate the lead-fields for the sources oriented normal to 
the cortical surface. The data from both magnetometers and gradi-
ometers were inverted together (Henson et al. 2009) to estimate activ-
ity at each cortical source using a minimum norm solution, where the 
inversion was performed simultaneously for all the regression weights 
for the epoch −200 to 600 ms. No depth weighting was applied. The 
estimated cortical activity was averaged across the specified time 
windows (70-160 and 200-400 ms-see Results) before generating an 
image in MNI space (absolute regression coefficient values), which 
was smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian smoothing kernel. This 
produces a cortical representation of the regression weights for each 
predictor, which were then averaged across participants, and displayed 
on an inflated cortex using <rs id="software-5" type="software">Caret</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.nitrc.org/projects/caret</rs>/). 
The color scale used was defined by the maximum absolute regression 
coefficient over all time windows and conditions with no thresholds 
applied. </p>

<p><rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">we</rs> present <rs id="software-0" type="software">taveRNA</rs>, a web server package that 
hosts three RNA web services: alteRNA, inteRNA 
and pRuNA. <rs type="software">alteRNA</rs> is a new alternative for RNA 
secondary structure prediction. It is based on 
a dynamic programming solution that minimizes 
the sum of energy density and free energy of an 
RNA structure. <rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> is the first RNA-RNA 
interaction structure prediction web service. It also 
employs a dynamic programming algorithm to 
minimize the free energy of the resulting joint 
structure of the two interacting RNAs. Lastly, 
<rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> is an efficient database pruning service; 
which given a query RNA, eliminates a significant 
portion of an ncRNA database and returns only 
a few ncRNAs as potential regulators. <rs id="software-4" type="software">taveRNA</rs> is 
available at <rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/taverna</rs>Until recently RNA was thought to have only two 
functions: (i) primarily as an information transmitter 
between DNA and proteins in the form of a messenger 
RNA (mRNA) and (ii) as a catalyser or an information 
decoder in protein synthesis in the form of a ribosomal 
RNA (rRNA) or a transfer RNA (tRNA). The discovery 
that RNA molecules can regulate gene expression 
completely altered this simplistic picture (1). This impor-
tant discovery, in particular the discovery of RNA 
interference (RNAi), the post-transcriptional silencing of 
gene expression via interactions between mRNAs and 
their antisense RNAs (by A. Fire and C. Mello) was 
awarded with the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or 
Medicine. 
Recent studies have revealed that antisense RNAs are 
only a very small subset of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). 
A large fraction of the genome sequence (up to 10% in the 
human genome) appears to give rise to RNA transcripts 
that do not code for proteins (2). The functionality of 
many such ncRNAs are only scarcely known. </p>

<p>Regulatory ncRNAs that are generally responsible for 
regulating gene expression exhibit an exact or partial 
complementarity to their target mRNAs. Their interac-
tion forms a complex that consists of several non-
contiguous helical segments which prevent ribosomal 
access to the target mRNA. Generally, regulatory 
ncRNAs contain one or more stem loop structures that 
are (almost) complementary to specific sequences in the 
target mRNAs. Interaction with a target RNA is either 
initiated at such a loop structure of the antisense RNA 
and a loop structure from the target (forming kissing loop 
pairs) or between a loop structure and a single-stranded 
segment of the complementary RNA. 
As the number of ncRNAs and in particular regulatory 
RNAs increase it has become of crucial importance to 
establish software tools that can help identify their 
functionality. For this purpose we introduce <rs type="software">taveRNA</rs>, 
a web-based computational tool set that can help identify 
structure and functionality of ncRNA molecules. 
taveRNA involves tools whose algorithmic foundations 
were developed by Simon Fraser University's Lab for 
Computational Biology over the past few years. The tools 
aim to solve the following key problems: </p>

<p><rs type="software">taveRNA</rs> involves web interfaces to the algorithmic 
tools we have developed for each one of the above 
problems: (1) <rs type="software">alteRNA</rs>, an alternative thermodynamic 
model-based RNA secondary structure prediction </p>

<p>program, (2) inteRNA, a program for predicting the joint 
secondary structure of two interacting RNAs and 
(3) pRuNA, a tool for quickly identifying all potential 
regulatory ncRNAs for a query mRNA. 
RNA secondary structure prediction is one of the earliest 
problems considered in computational biology. Despite 
a 30-year-effort towards its solution, the best algorithms 
and software for RNA structure prediction are still far 
from perfect. The most common approach to the RNA 
secondary structure prediction problem is the standard 
thermodynamic approach. This general methodology 
suggests to compute the secondary structure of an RNA 
molecule by minimizing the total free energy of its 
substructures such as stems, loops and bulges. <rs type="software">alteRNA</rs> is 
an alternative thermodynamic approach to the RNA 
secondary structure prediction problem, which aims 
to minimize a linear combination of total free energy and 
total energy density using the dynamic programming 
formulation proposed in (3), in contrast to the available 
alternatives such as <rs type="software">Mfold</rs> (4), <rs type="software">RNAscf</rs> (5) and alifold 
(6), which all employ the standard thermodynamic 
approach. 
As mentioned earlier, there are a number of algorithms 
for predicting the secondary structure of a single RNA 
molecule. However, until recently no such algorithm 
existed for reliably predicting the joint secondary structure 
of two interacting RNA molecules, or measuring the 
stability of such a joint structure. At SFU Lab for 
Computational Biology, <rs corresp="#software-14" type="creator">we</rs> developed <rs id="software-14" type="software">inteRNA</rs> the first 
program that aims to compute the joint structure 
prediction of two given RNA sequences through 
minimizing their total free energy, which is a function of 
the topology of the joint structure. The algorithmic 
foundations of <rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> were introduced in (7). 
<rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> aims to minimize the joint free energy under 
a number of energy models with growing complexity. Our 
default energy model is based mostly on stacked pair 
energies given by Mathews et al. (8)-the free energy 
model employed by <rs type="software">Mfold</rs>. Because there is very little 
thermodynamic information on kissing loop sequences in 
the literature, <rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> employs the approach used by 
Rivas and Eddy (9) to differentiate the thermodynamic 
parameters of 'external' bonds from the 'internal' bonds, 
i.e. we simply multiply the external parameters with 
a weight slightly smaller than 1. Note that the default 
algorithmic engine used by <rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> requires substantial 
resources in terms of running time and memory which 
could be prohibitive for predicting joint structure of 
sufficiently long RNAs. Thus we made available an 
alternative heuristic engine that aims to capture 
the joint secondary structure of interacting RNAs. This 
heuristic approach is based on the observation that the 
substructures that are available independently in each 
RNA are mostly preserved in their joint secondary 
structure. 
Regulatory ncRNAs play important roles in controlling 
gene expression via establishing stable joint structures 
with target mRNAs and prohibiting ribosomal access. 
As many novel regulatory RNA classes are being 
discovered, the determination of the exact functionality 
of all regulatory ncRNAs is one of the most significant </p>

<p>scientific challenges to be tackled in the coming years. 
Our software tool pRuNA is developed for helping to 
address this challenge: it aims to identify all potential 
regulatory ncRNAs that can establish stable joint 
structures with a query mRNA (10). An important 
component of <rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> is a sequence filter which eliminates 
a significant fraction of the available ncRNA collection 
and retains only the most likely ncRNA candidates for 
forming a stable joint structure with the query mRNA. 
We note that the majority of regulatory ncRNAs are only 
partially complementary to their target mRNA sequences. 
Typically these RNAs contain at least two short (5-7 nt) 
motifs on their loop structures that are complementary to 
the specific single-stranded locations in the target RNAs 
(11). Thus <rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> first identifies all pairs of 5-mer motifs 
from the ncRNA loop sequences that are complementary 
to a pair of 5-mer motifs in the loop sequences of the 
query mRNA. The ncRNAs that include such 5-mer motif 
pairs are then tested against the query mRNA via the use 
of <rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> and those which can establish stable joint 
structures are returned by the program. </p>

<p><rs type="software">alteRNA</rs>: AN RNA SECONDARY STRUCTURE 
PREDICTION TOOL BASED ON AN ALTERNATIVE 
THERMODYNAMIC APPROACH </p>

<p><rs type="software">alteRNA</rs> requires a sequence in FASTA format, where the 
sequence is represented as a string of characters from 
the alphabet AE ¼ {A,C,G,U,T} (the characters are case 
insensitive). The length of the input RNA sequence is 
limited by 500 nt. There are two user-specified parameters, 
s and b, which will be explained in detail later. 
alteRNA outputs the results in three different forms: </p>

<p>1. The predicted RNA structure in dot-parenthesis 
format. The sequence is given from 5 
0 to 3 
0 end, 
and the structure is given with matching parenthesis 
denoting a base pair and a dot denoting an 
unbounded base. 
2. The predicted RNA structure in Connect(.ct) file 
format, which is the standard <rs type="software">Mfold</rs> output format. 
The sequence length is given in the first line. 
For each nucleotide i, there is a line which consists 
of: the line number (i), the letter denotion of the 
nucleotide, the predecessor base index (i À 1), the 
successor base index (i þ 1), the paired base index 
(0 if unpaired) and the original base index (i). 
3. The graphics files for the predicted secondary 
structure in Postscript(.ps) and GIF format. These 
graphs are created using <rs type="software">NAVIEW</rs> (12) and <rs type="software">Mfold</rs>/ 
plt2. </p>

<p>The secondary structure predicted by <rs type="software">alteRNA</rs> for 
5sRNA is shown in Figure 1a. </p>

<p>substructure, which, in return, can improve the secondary 
structure prediction of several ncRNA families. 
This alternative thermodynamic approach which we call 
Densityfold (3) aims to minimize the linear combination 
of the total free energy and total energy density of all 
substructures in the RNA molecule. Given an RNA 
secondary structure, the energy density of a basepair is 
defined as the free energy of the substructure that starts 
with the basepair, normalized by the length of the 
underlying sequence. The energy density of an unpaired 
base is then defined to be the energy density of the closest 
basepair that encloses it. Densityfold thus aims to 
minimize ED(n) þ sÁE(n), where ED(n) is the total energy 
density of paired and unpaired bases, E(n) is the total free 
energy and n is the length of the RNA sequence. Here s 
determines the weight of the contribution of the total free 
energy in the optimization function. As s approaches to 
1, the predicted secondary structure gets closer to that 
implied by the standard thermodynamic approach 
(employed by <rs type="software">Mfold</rs>). We have observed that s ¼ 5 
generally gives the most accurate prediction, in terms of 
structure edit distance (13), however in some RNA 
sequences, different s values can outperform s ¼ 5. 
We note that the free energy of a multi-branch loop 
as implied by the standard thermodynamic model is not 
a linear function and as a result cannot be used in 
a dynamic programming formulation. Thus we use the 
same approximate formulation as per Mfold, which, for 
a given multi-branch loop, L sets: </p>

<p>pairs and ddG stack is the free energy of each branch in the 
loop. The default setting for b, the coefficient for the 
number unpaired bases, is 0 in Mfold; this implies 
that there will be no penalty for the unpaired bases. 
However, when used with Densityfold, this setting seems 
to produce large stretches of unpaired bases in multi-
branch loops. In order to counter this effect we suggest the 
user to set b to a small positive value less than 1. <rs type="software">alteRNA</rs>, 
our web-based tool for RNA secondary structure predic-
tion via the Densityfold approach allows the user to 
specify any positive value for s and b. The default values 
of s and b are 5 and 0, respectively and the folding 
temperature is fixed at 378C. </p>

<p><rs type="software">inteRNA</rs>: A Web-Based Tool For RNA-RNA 
Interaction Prediction </p>

<p><rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> requires as an input two RNA sequences in 
FASTA format. The sequences are represented as strings 
of characters from the alphabet AE ¼ {A,C,G,U,T} 
(the strings are case insensitive). The length of each 
input RNA sequence is limited by 150 nt for Stacked Pair 
Model and by 500 nt for Loop Models. There are three 
user-specified parameters; gap penalty, maximum 
subsequence length and energy model; each of these 
parameters are explained in detail later. 
<rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> reports the results in three different output 
forms: </p>

<p>Figure 1. The output pages of <rs type="software">taveRNA</rs>. (a) <rs type="software">alteRNA</rs> secondary structure prediction for 5sRNA. (b) <rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> joint structure prediction for 
CopA and CopT. </p>

<p>A sample interaction between CopA and CopT, 
predicted by <rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> is shown in Figure 1b. </p>

<p><rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> uses a dynamic programming algorithm, which 
aims to predict the joint secondary structure of two 
interacting RNA molecules through minimizing their total 
free energy. In other words, it predicts the secondary 
structure of both RNA strands and the interaction 
simultaneously. Since the general joint structure predic-
tion problem is NP-Complete, it is necessary to set some 
limitations on the structures predicted: inteRNA does not 
allow any (internal or external) pseudoknots; it does not 
allow any zig-zag structures either (7). 
<rs type="software">inteRNA</rs> can employ the following two models for 
approximating the total free energy of the joint structure. 
Stacked pair model: This model uses stacking pair 
energy functions both externally and internally. A gap 
penalty parameter is used to penalize opening a gap. Due 
to high computational complexity and memory require-
ments of this model, inteRNA cannot accept inputs with 
large (4200 nt) sequence lengths with this setting. 
Loop model: It has been observed that RNA molecules 
mostly preserve their independent secondary structure 
when they interact with other RNA. Interactions thus 
typically occur between kissing hairpin loops. The loop 
model first predicts the secondary structure of each RNA 
sequence independently using three different approaches: 
(i) through the standard thermodynamic model (<rs type="software">Mfold</rs> 
Loop Model), (ii) through Stacked Pair Model using 
a single RNA sequence (Default Loop Model) and 
(iii) through <rs type="software">alteRNA</rs> (alteRNA Loop Model). It then 
identifies all independent subsequences of each RNA 
structure: these are substructures (each implied by 
a basepair) whose sequence length is less than a specified 
value. It then computes the joint secondary structure that 
can be established between each pair of independent 
subsequences (one subsequence from each RNA) and the 
free energy of this joint structure. Finally, it finds the set of 
independent subsequence pairs which can co-exist and 
minimize the total free energy of the overall secondary 
structure. </p>

<p><rs type="software">pRuNA</rs>: A REGULATORY RNA SEARCH ENGINE </p>

<p><rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> asks for a query mRNA sequence as well as its 
corresponding secondary structure in parenthesis format. 
It returns a list of possible regulating ncRNAs available 
through the Rfam database (14). </p>

<p>At the heart of <rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> we have a lookup table of size 
1024 Â 1024, which represents every possible pair of 5-mer 
motifs from the 4-letter RNA alphabet. Each entry in the 
lookup table maintains a pointer to every occurrence of 
the respective 5-mer motif pair in the loop sequences of the 
ncRNA structures in the Rfam database. For querying the 
index, <rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> first identifies the loop sequences from 
the mRNA, based on the given secondary structure 
information. It then extracts each pair of non-overlapping 
5-mer motifs from the mRNA loop sequences and checks 
the lookup table for its reverse complement. The union of 
the set of ncRNAs that include each motif pair are 
retained by <rs type="software">pRuNA</rs>, whereas the remainder of the 
ncRNAs in the database are eliminated. We have observed 
that many of the motif pairs in the lookup table occur very 
frequently in ncRNA sequences and thus have limited 
information content. We omitted the 5-mer pairs which 
occur in more than the number (14) of ncRNAs that 
include a 'typical' motif pair. This increased our pruning 
efficiency substantially yet had no effect on the quality of 
the results: we have tested <rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> mRNAs that are 
known to be regulated by an ncRNA available through 
the NPInter database (15). For all 24 of these mRNAs, 
<rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> was able to return the known regulatory 
ncRNA among the set of potential regulators, while 
achieving a pruning efficiency of 86% on the average. 
If the search is restricted to E. coli ncRNAs, the pruning 
efficiency for the 22 mRNAs regulated by these ncRNAs 
go up to 91% on the average. Further details on <rs type="software">pRuNA</rs> 
(including the method and experimental results) can be 
found in (10). </p>

<p><rs type="software">taveRNA</rs> is a web application implemented in html/php;

sequence with length n, the running time of <rs type="software">alteRNA</rs> is

In addition, a migration experiment was performed in a 
24-well Transwell unit (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, USA), as 
previously reported (24). The cells were starved for 12 h and 
8x10

swell unit with serum-free medium. The lower compartment 
was filled with medium containing 10% FBS. Subsequent to 
24 or 48 h, the cells in the upper chamber were removed by 
gentle swabbing. The number of cells migrating to the lower 
surface of the membrane was determined using crystal violet. 
Five microscopic fields were randomly selected and viewed at

that experimental conditions between SMS and XRD experiments were consistent: 
the same cryostat with the same temperature thermocouples and membrane 
controller were used in both experiments. Two types of XRD experiments were 
conducted: decreasing temperatures at a constant pressure with an x-ray wavelength 
of 0.4072 Å ; increasing pressures at a constant temperature of 50 K or 13 K with 
an x-ray wavelength of 0.3737 Å . Diffraction patterns were collected by a MAR345

[15-16] Gene related annotation was mainly done 
with <rs type="software">ANNOVAR</rs>. 
[17] The pathogenicity of a variant was 
determined based on frequency in the population and in silico 
prediction. We excluded common variants (frequency &gt; 1%) 
present in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ESP 
(Exome Sequencing Project), the 1000 Genomes database, and 
exomes generated in house from 550 unaffected Chinese control 
samples. Variants annotated in the Human Gene Mutation 
Database (HGMD) were regarded as disease-causing. All 
nonsynonymous variants were subjected to in silico analysis, 
which included functional annotation algorithms such as SIFT, 
PolyPhen2, GERP++, and MutationTaster. All variants identified 
by NGS and deemed as pathogenic were verified by Sanger 
sequencing, using primers designed from <rs id="software-16" type="software">Primer 3</rs> online 
software (<rs corresp="#software-16" type="url">http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3–0.4.0/primer3/input.htm</rs>). </p>

<p>A case-control study was conducted. Variables 
with normal distribution were compared using rank 
sum test. Quantitative data were expressed as means 
± standard deviation (SD). Where appropriate, com-
parisons were performed using a paired t test or a 
Mann-Whitney U test. Qualitative data were pre-
sented as rate and compared with Chi-square test. A 
value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. Statistical analysis was done with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 13.0</rs> for Windows. </p>

<p>The vast majority of the cases included were bilateral re-
constructions (81.9%); thus, there was concern that these 
breasts were not independent. Therefore, when possible, 
the analyses were adjusted for clustering to correct for any 
potential dependence between breast pairs. All continu-
ous data were reviewed for potential outliers, which were 
defined as values &gt;3 SDs from the mean (11 breasts from 
9 patients were excluded). Any cases with outliers were 
removed from analysis. The resulting patient characteris-
tics, demographics, and complication frequencies between 
the 2 matrix types were compared using Fisher exact test 
(categorical variables), t tests, and Mann-Whitney U test 
(continuous variables, normally or not-normally distrib-
uted, respectively). Additionally, a binomial logistic regres-
sion model using a general estimating equation (GEE) 
approach was used to determine significant predictors of 
whether a complication would occur or not. In addition 
to the matrix type, other a priori predictors were based 
on published data and included age, 
25,26 body mass index 
(BMI), 
27,28 duration of drain in place, 
29 preoperative radia-
tion treatment, 
20,27 hypertensive status, 
25 and active smoking 
status. 
20,27 In all cases, significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05. 
Furthermore, the results from the regression models are

<p>We evaluated 221 patients and 81 primary care providers from the

As of 12/2013, there were 6408 enrolees. Our analysis 
included 1997 male participants reporting non-heterosexual 
orientation or sex with men as an HIV risk factor; self-
completed at least one sexual behaviour questionnaire between 
2010 and 2013 and attended one of seven clinics that submitted 
all chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests to PHOL, the primary pro-
vider for chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests for sexual health 
clinics (HIV specialty and primary care clinics may also send 
specimens to private laboratories). 
We conducted all statistical analyses using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> V.<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, North Carolina, USA). p Values were two-sided 
and statistical significance was determined using the p value of 
&lt;0.05. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the cumula-
tive incidence proportions tested for or diagnosed with chla-
mydia or gonorrhoea following completion of the first sexual 
behaviour questionnaire. As previously done, diagnosis rates 
were calculated among tested and untested participants 
2 thus 
underestimating true incidence since asymptomatic infections 
among those untested are excluded from the numerator. 
For risk factor analysis, we grouped chlamydia and gonor-
rhoea into a composite outcome to improve statistical power 
and because their modes of transmission and clinical/public 
health implications are similar; HR estimates for separate chla-
mydia and gonorrhoea outcomes were not meaningfully differ-
ent. For men diagnosed more than once, we selected the earliest 
event, which occurred rarely. We excluded participants with 
missing data (1.3% of observations) and two cases with zero 
event times. Men with no events were censored using the earli-
est of the dates of loss to follow-up, death or 31 December

<p>name, alias or accession. The query will find only one of 
the possibly many networks satisfying the constraint, but 
the one found will have the minimum number of interac-
tions. Finally, the batch query allows a user to upload one 
or two lists of molecule identifiers (name, alias or acces-
sion). The user has two options: to analyze the number of 
molecules in the lists that 'hit' each predefined pathway or 
to construct the novel network(s) that include all interac-
tions using any of the listed molecules. For the first 
option, the query uses a hypergeometric distribution to 
compute the probability that each pathway in the data-
base is hit by molecules in either of the lists. The query 
returns a list of pathways ordered by P-value. In the visua-
lization of a predefined pathway (first option) or novel 
pathway (second option), molecules from the first list 
are colored blue, molecules from the second list are 
colored red and any molecules appearing in both lists 
are colored purple. Supplementary Figure 1 presents an 
example of invoking the batch query with a single mole-
cule list, the 120 protein kinases found by Greenman et al. 
(7) to have at least one cancer-predisposing mutation. 
Selecting the predefined pathways option, one can see 
that this list samples a small number of pathways, 
biased toward immune cell signaling, at a P &lt; 0.0001. 
While PID associates a single external database acces-
sion (typically a UniProt accession) with a protein, the 
query interface searches PID not only by UniProt acces-
sion, but also by related gene identifiers (HUGO symbol, 
alias, Entrez Gene identifier). Any predefined pathway or 
novel network can be visualized in either GIF (graphics 
interchange format) or SVG (scalable vector graphics) 
graphic mode. Network graphics are all automatically 
constructed from the underlying data using the 
<rs type="software">GraphViz</rs> package (8). Events and molecule uses in the 
graphics are hyperlinked to HTML pages of information 
about the interaction or molecule. In addition, any prede-
fined pathway or novel network can be exported in native 
PID XML or BioPAX Level 2 formats. Using the BioPAX 
export, a user can also visualize PID pathways in 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">Cytoscape</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://cytoscape.org</rs>) a popular third-party 
network visualization tool (9). For any predefined path-
way, the user can obtain (and export to tab-separated 
format) a list of literature citations and participating

<p>the Cancer Genome Atlas project has mapped genomic 
abnormalities of different types-copy number, mutation 
and methylation-to a set of oncogenic processes (10). At 
present, most attempts to profile tumor subtypes have 
relied on DNA and RNA assays. However, as high-
throughput proteomic methods improve the kind of 
detailed information on posttranslational modifications 
of proteins available in PID will be essential in mapping 
more accurately the state of a cell. 
Consistent with its focus on interactions and events 
derived from curated signaling cascades and regulatory 
processes, PID does not at present include interaction 
data deriving from high-throughput protein-protein inter-
action experiments. This reflects not a judgment on the 
quality of high-throughput data, but a recognition that 
there are databases specifically designed to provide access 
to this data (11, 12, 13). However, while it does not lead 
directly to the construction of signaling cascades, informa-
tion from high-throughput protein-protein interaction 
experiments can be useful in interpreting the curated path-
ways and assessing their completeness. For example, a 
high-throughput protein-protein interaction experiment 
can identify an unexpected binding partner for a catalyst, 
suggesting the possibility that the in vivo presence of the 
partner can sequester the catalyst and thus turn off down-
stream interactions. In the future, PID will allow users to 
take advantage of high-throughput protein-protein inter-
action data, either by allowing users to upload interaction 
sets to be added to the novel networks created by PID 
queries or by querying other data sources (such as 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">Pathway Commons</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://pathwaycommons.org</rs>) as 
needed to support a user query. The PID data model is 
currently being integrated with NCI's Cancer Bioinfor-
matics Infrastructure Objects model (caBIO) (14), thereby 
making PID data accessible on NCI's caGrid (15). </p>

<p>Continuous variables followed a normal distribution is

<p>What will be the effect of the proposed East Asian RTAs on each of the East 
Asian countries considered in this paper: China, Japan, Korea and the ASEAN 
nations? Are there any sustainable RTAs? The answers to these questions can be 
found by assessing the macroeconomic aggregate effects of the proposed East 
Asian RTA strategies by applying a traditional static CGE model simulation 
technique. We have adopted a trade-linked multi-sector and multi-country CGE 
model to measure the impact of East Asian regional economic integration 
efforts on welfare, real GDP, exports and income terms of trade. We have 
carefully selected those four aggregate variables to measure the effectiveness of 
proposed strategies according to type of RTA for each economy considered. The 
equivalent variations in welfare have been selected mainly for the consumption 
effect. Real GDP is used for the production effect. Exports have been chosen 
for the volume of trade effect. Income terms of trade are another important 
measure of welfare change. 
13 In addition, to support our findings, we report the 
effect on imports and bilateral trade patterns. 
The CGE model we describe in this section is the <rs id="software-1" type="software">GTAP6inGAMS</rs> model 
developed by <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Rutherford</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2005</rs>). 
14 The model has three economic agents: 
producers, representative consumers (private and public) and trading partners. 
The <rs type="software">GTAP6inGAMS</rs> model is a traditional static Arrow-Debreu general 
equilibrium model in which the zero profit condition and market clearance 
define the equilibrium. The <rs type="software">GTAP6inGAMS</rs> is a modified version of the GTAP 
model version 6 developed for GAMS users. Most of the model specifications 
are the same as the <rs type="software">GTAP</rs> model. The differences between the <rs type="software">GTAP</rs> model 
and <rs type="software">GAMS</rs> version of the model are as follows. First, the <rs type="software">GTAP</rs> model is based 
on a constant difference elasticity demand system, but the <rs type="software">GAMS</rs> model uses 
Cobb-Douglas preferences. Second, the <rs type="software">GTAP</rs> model assumes that global 
capital is endogenously allocated by regional rates of return. However, for </p>

<p>simplicity, the GTAP6inGAMS model exogenously fixes the global capital 
flows. The model described in the present paper uses a classification consisting 
of 7 sectors and 25 economies, as in Park (2006). 
15 The model solution has 
been calibrated, with 2001 as the base year, using global trade, assistance and 
production data from the <rs id="software-19" type="software">GTAP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-19" type="version-number">6</rs> Database. 
16 The model has been implemented 
using the <rs type="software">GAMS MPSGE</rs>. 
17 The <rs type="software">GTAP6inGAMS</rs> model is adopted because the 
CGE model is in line with the commonly used GTAP model and the solver, 
<rs type="software">GAMS MPSGE</rs>, is simple and easy to handle. </p>

<p>15. The seven sectors are: agricultural products, food products, extractive industry, light 
manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, technology-intensive manufacturing, and services. The 27 
economies are: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the rest of Southeast 
Asia, China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India, Mexico, 
New Zealand, Peru, Russia, the USA, the European Free Trade Association, the Western European 
countries, and the rest of the world.

ad valorem tariffs include tariff rate quotas and the ad valorem equivalents of specific tariffs. The 
export taxes cover ordinary export subsidies, export tax equivalents of Agreement on Textiles and 
Clothing quotas, price undertakings and voluntary export restraints. The protection rates in service

19. As the referee indicated, the base year for existing RTA, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, should be 
2004 or 2005 (right before the year into force in Table 1). However, similar to other hypothetical 
scenarios in the present paper, the complete elimination of trade barriers between ASEAN and 
China are assumed and simulated. Of course, we acknowledge this data problem as a limitation. </p>

<p>Oxidative stress. Tissue ROS levels were measured by the conversion of

ROS (26) (for details, see the supplementary methods available in an online 
appendix at http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0079). Activity of mitochondrial

(27). 
RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 
hearts with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), purified with the 
RNEasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and reverse transcribed (6). Data were 
normalized by expressing them relative to the levels of the invariant transcript 
16S RNA. Primer sequences and accession numbers are presented in supple-

Western blot analysis. Isolated mitochondria or whole-cell extracts were 
prepared as described previously and resolved by SDS-PAGE (5,6). For 
antibody conditions see supplementary methods in the online appendix. 
Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay 
kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and equal protein loading was verified by Coomas-
sie staining. 
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means Ϯ SE. When comparing 
two groups, significance was determined using a Student's t test. Effects of

The numerical simulation was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">COMSOL</rs> v<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.0</rs> (see 
Fig. 2, C and D). A time-dependent transient 2D model was used to sim-
ulate waveforms by applying an AC signal to regions representing the 
IDT finger pairs on a piezoelectric substrate. The stiffness, coupling co-
efficient, and electrical permittivity matrices were rotated to correspond 
to the 128°y-cut x-propagating LN crystal used experimentally. The max-

<p>supply and consumption; and innovative 
urban design. These lenses are described in 
McCafferty et al. (2010). Each of these lenses 
represented a significant urban research area in 
its own right. However, each of these is inter-
related. Thus, the changing profile of popula-
tion demographics in cities is essential for 
planning for urban transport, housing, energy, 
water use and health care. 
Across Australia (and indeed in most other 
countries), a huge array of organisations 
collects and holds datasets that are fundamental 
to tackling the current and future challenges 
facing cities. On the one hand, some of these 
data providers have data that are directly 
accessible on the Web. For example, the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS, 
&lt;http://www.abs.gov.au&gt;) has over 1 million 
web pages through which a huge array of past 
and present Census data can be accessed, as 
well as an extensive array of surveys and 
reports related to the Australian population. On 
the other hand, many other national and state-
based agencies do not offer access to their 
'data', preferring instead to release data in 
aggregated forms; for example, as written 
reports. Being able to access and combine 
distributed data from multiple independent and 
autonomous organisations through a unified 
environment would greatly simplify the life of 
many urban researchers and allow major urban 
research challenges to be systematically tack-
led. Ideally, such a solution would offer live 
(programmatic) access to in situ remote data 
resources from the definitive data providers 
and avoid web scraping or other ad hoc data 
collection mechanisms that would break when 
websites and their content change. The solution 
should provide tools to support collection and 
enrichment of provider-specific metadata to 
enable complex data analytics scenarios using 
this diverse ecosystem of data. The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> 
platform has delivered such an integrated, 
data-rich research environment. AURIN is not 
unique in this endeavour and a range of efforts 
is currently ongoing-albeit on a much more 
focused domain; for example, with a fixed or 
known set of data providers. 
The UK Economic and Social Research 
Council-funded Data Management through </p>

<p>
and tools offered by all providers through 
federated authentication to the <rs id="software-3" type="software">AURIN</rs> portal, 
available at &lt;<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">https://portal.aurin.org.au</rs>&gt;; that 
is, users authenticate at their (potentially 
remote) home organisation and are subse-
quently able to access all data without further 
challenge or response demands from any data 
provider. It is important to note that single 
sign-on here does not imply that all data and 
tools are accessible to all users at all times. 
Several data providers place specific demands 
on who can access their data and tools and what 
they can subsequently do with these data. 
The Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA, 
&lt;http://www.psma.com.au&gt;) is one example 
of a commercial partner that requires restricted 
usage to their data. It should also be pointed 
out that through the federated authentication 
model, any academic across Australia (that is, 
those with an email address ending in 
'.edu.au') is able to access the portal directly. 
Other non-academics (for example, those from 
industry and government) are able to access the 
portal through targeted accounts that are set up 
through the access federation virtual home 
organisation. </p>

<p>There are at present (December 2015) 1,661 
datasets that are accessible through the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> 
platform from 66 separate organisations. These 
data providers and the nature and number of data 
they make available are summarised in Table 1. 
As seen, these datasets cross federal govern-
ment, state government, local government, 
industry and academia. The data shown in 
Table 1 represent the total data that are currently 
available across Australia. However, it is often 
(typically) the case that researchers are interested 
in data related to a particular regional setting; for 
example, transport issues in Melbourne or 
property prices in Sydney. The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform 
provides a user-driven interface that allows 
researchers to access data through selecting the 
area of interest through a map-based interface, as 
shown in Figure 2, or through selection of data 
based upon the geospatial aggregation level, as 
shown in Figure 3. </p>

<p>It is important to note that the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> 
platform provides an extensive variety of 
geospatial coordinate systems that capture 
changes over time. Thus, Figure 2 shows the 
postal areas as defined by the ABS in 2011. A 
different set of polygons for those portal areas 
existed historically-this is the case for the 
many other flavours of geospatial classification 
that exists or has existed across Australia: local 
government areas, statistical local areas, 
working zones, statistical areas (SA4 down 
to SA1) as shown in Figure 3, labour force 
regions, greater capital city areas, statistical 
divisions, urban centre localities, suburbs, 
Commonwealth electronic divisions amongst 
many others. Capturing these changes over 
time is essential for researchers so that they can 
compare meaningful data in meaningful con-
texts. This is especially the case for those 
interested in longitudinal studies of cities. 
The datasets cover an extensive variety of 
information related to Australian urban settle-
ments. As an example of the diversity of the 
information available through the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> 
platform, searching across a range of keywords 
returns extensive data, as shown in Table 2. It is 
noted that the platform supports a range of 
fuzzy search capabilities; for example, search-
ing for employ will return matching datasets 
with data or metadata including terms such as 
unemployed and employment. 
The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform allows much more 
targeted searching for specific data that might 
be available. Thus, transport researchers might 
be interested in terms such as train (34), tram 
(21), car (79), station (12), bus stop (2), 
accident (31), bicycle (10), pedestrian (4) and 
commute (7), where the numbers in parentheses 
represent the number of datasets that include 
the italicised keywords. 
It is essential that the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform 
supports the access to, and integration of, 
diverse datasets. In supporting access to data, 
it was recognised that each remote data 
provider is autonomous and can make its data 
available through technologies that it deems 
appropriate; that is, AURIN cannot demand 
that the provider install a particular software 
stack. A rich variety of technical solutions has 
been developed and delivered to meet the°C </p>

<p>
diversity of the urban data ecosystem across 
Australia. Many of these are based around 
geospatial software systems and standards; for 
example, Open Geospatial Consortium stand-
ards (&lt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc&gt;). 
To support the integration of data, the 
platform utilises next-generation Cloud-based 
noSQL systems (<rs type="software">CouchDB</rs>) and associated 
data translation systems. We demonstrate the 
data integration capabilities through a repre-
sentative case study. </p>

<p>Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) is 
a product developed by the ABS that ranks 
areas in Australia according to relative socio-
economic advantage and disadvantage. The 
indices are based on information from the 
5 yearly Census. SEIFA 2011 is (at present) 
the latest version of this product and consists 
of four indices. The Index of Relative 
Socio-Economic Advantage and Disadvantage 
(IRSAD) summarises information about 
the economic and social conditions of people 
and households within an area, including 
both relative advantage and disadvantage 
measures. The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform provides 
access to the IRSAD data from the ABS-
specifically, the data classified across the SA2s 
across Australia. 
One typical scenario in using the IRSAD 
data is to identify regions facing particular 
challenges regarding disadvantage. Creation 
of a choropleth map through the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> </p>

<p>environment allows visualisation of the levels 
of advantage and disadvantage for all SA2s of 
Australia, as shown in Figure 4. As seen from 
Figure 4, there are areas of particular disad-
vantage in the Northern Territory, South 
Australia and northern Queensland. Here, the 
paler colour represents a lower SEIFA IRSAD 
score and the darker colour represents areas of 
higher scores. The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform allows 
arbitrary selection of the classification scales. 
As seen from Figure 4, the table (lower left) 
shows the actual numeric values associated 
with the SEIFA IRSAD score. 
Understanding the issues surrounding SA2s 
with a lower IRSAD score can be explored 
through the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform. Here, we 
consider the number of children in welfare-
dependent or low income families (earning less 
that $20,799), which is available from 
UA_PHIDU. Combining (merging) the SEIFA 
dataset and the UA_PHIDU dataset allows for 
a range of statistical analyses to be undertaken. 
Through selecting data at the SA2 level, these 
datasets can be combined directly (utilising the 
unique codes associated with the SA2s across 
Australia). Once merged, a range of analyses 
can be undertaken. Here, we consider a basic 
linear regression, although we note that the 
<rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform contains over 100 analytical 
tools that are available for richer geospatial 
analytics. These tools are outlined in Sinnott 
and Voorsluys (2015). 
Figure 5 shows the correlation between the 
SEIFA IRSAD score and the number of lower 
income or welfare-dependent families in the 
SA2s across Australia. It is noted that the 
<rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform enforces intelligent decision-
making where it can; for example, by checking 
that the datasets that are joined are at the same 
geospatial aggregation level (SA2). Outliers in 
these correlations (for example, areas with low 
SEIFA scores or areas with large numbers of 
children in welfare-dependent or low income 
families) can be seen directly. What is key here 
is that these are independent datasets from 
independent organisations that hitherto have not 
allowed direct comparison. Instead, researchers 
typically have to source these datasets them-
selves through ad hoc means and undertake such 
analysis using a range of tools. </p>

<p>A further analysis that might be considered 
is the SEIFA IRSAD score and the percentage 
of 16 year olds in secondary college; that is, do 
we observe more people leaving school earlier 
in more disadvantaged areas? This dataset is 
also available from UA_PHIDU. Using the 
<rs type="software">AURIN</rs> tools to merge the datasets and analyse 
the data, we see the correlation shown in 
Figure 6. The data points in the lower-left 
portion of the scatter plot represent those SA2s 
with a low SEIFA IRSAD score and lower 
school-leaving age. 
Figure 4 shows that many of the disadvan-
tages arise in areas with increased numbers of 
Indigenous persons. A further dimension to 
this analysis is to explore the correlation 
between the poor health of the Indigenous 
communities and the SEIFA IRSAD score. </p>

<p>Information on the health of the Indigenous 
population is available from UC_NATSEM. 
The correlation between the SEIFA IRSAD 
score and poor-health information of the 
Indigenous population of Australia is shown 
in Figure 7. Figure 7 also shows the interactive, 
user-oriented nature of the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> portal. 
Thus, the outlier in the scatter plot is shown 
(in red) along with the location (East Arnhem) 
on the map (top). This interactivity of the 
underlying data is key to helping support the 
advanced visual analytics of the urban data 
landscape. 
The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform supports rich spatial 
data analytics capabilities. One scenario of 
interest is whether areas of advantage 
and/or disadvantage tend to cluster together 
geospatially. As one example of a spatial </p>

<p>To support these analyses, it is necessary to 
spatialise (add the geometry) to the SA2s and 
calculate their contiguous spatial weights; that 
is, count SA2s if they share a border or a corner 
with other SA2s. The range of possible 
Moran's I values is between -1 and 1. An 
estimate of 0 implies no spatial autocorrelation 
exists. For a significant estimate, the closer it 
gets to 1, the greater the degree of positive 
spatial autocorrelation, while the closer it 
is to -1, the stronger the negative spatial 
autocorrelation. 
Applying the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> statistical analysis 
tools to the 2011 SEIFA IRSAD scores for 
the SA2s of Australia produces the spatial 
autocorrelation scores shown in Figure 8. As 
shown, there is a slight correlation between the 
spatial correlation (0.1922) of the 2011 SEIFA 
IRSAD scores and the SA2s of Australia. 
A Moran scatter plot is used to visualise and 
identify the degree of local spatial instability in 
spatial association that is present in the Moran's 
I statistic. The scatter plot is useful in identifying 
those observations that do not conform; that is, 
they differ significantly from the global Moran's 
I in magnitude and/or direction. </p>

<p>The scatter plot centres on the point where 
the mean of the variable meets the mean 
of the lagged variable and the four quadrants of 
the plot relative to this point give information 
about the type of association that is present. 
The upper-right and lower-left quadrants 
shown in Figure 9 represent positive spatial 
association, while the upper-left and lower-
right quadrants show those observations that 
have negative spatial association. The density 
of each of the quadrants indicates which spatial 
pattern dominates and also provides informa-
tion on the distribution of the individual spatial 
associations and the contribution of each to the 
global statistic. Furthermore, the plot shows 
outliers and leverage points and can provide an 
overall picture of the consistency of the global 
indicator. 
Moran's I is just one of the more advanced 
spatial statistical correlations that are available in 
the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform. These tools represent best 
practice in statistical analyses. Detailed docu-
mentation on all of these tools is available 
through the AURIN website (&lt;http://docs.aurin. 
org.au&gt;), together with a range of advanced 
tutorials covering which analyses should be </p>

<p>applied in which context. Such capabilities allow 
more advanced analyses to be made available to 
non-spatial statistics experts. 
It is noted that whilst many researchers 
derive great benefit from the rich variety of 
tools that is available within the portal, some 
researchers prefer to simply have access to the 
AURIN datasets and download them to their 
own desktop to undertake their own desktop-
based analytics; for example, using tools such 
as <rs type="software">ArcGIS</rs>, <rs type="software">STATA</rs> or <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>. The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> 
portal supports the download of data in 
comma-separated-variable format, Javascript 
Object Notation and as Shapefiles. The 
platform also supports the notion of projects 
and a range of separate experiments can be 
supported. 
The platform also allows researchers to 
upload their own data and compare or analyse 
their datasets with other datasets that are made 
available through the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> environment. </p>

<p>In this article, we described the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> 
e-infrastructure and its support for diverse 
data use/re-use and integration scenarios. 
The system currently supports seamless and 
secure access to data from, at present, 66 
independent and typically definitive and auton-
omous data organisations across Australia, 
with over 1,661 unique datasets currently 
accessible. These cover unit-level datasets 
through to aggregated data across a multitude 
of scales (both temporal and spatial). These 
systems are driven by metadata with tools to 
support data harvesting and subsequent enrich-
ment by data providers. The AURIN model of 
data access, use/re-use and integration 
has already demonstrated its flexibility and 
scaleability, with new data sources being 
continually added with minimal impact on 
the underlying infrastructure. 
The work described here has primarily 
focused on the technical aspects of the 
e-infrastructure and exemplar uses. It should 
be noted that the systems have gained signifi-
cant traction across the urban research land-
scape, and interestingly, in government, with 
many government agencies now accessing and </p>

<p>using the systems for their own needs. There 
have been over 50,000 user sessions in 
accessing the <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform, with major 
acceptance by academic and non-academic 
users. There are over 3,000 regular users of the 
<rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform. 
The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform is very much focused 
on urban and built environment research 
challenges, but it is broadly applicable to other 
domains of application. For example, it is now 
used as the basis for a range of other new 
projects including the Department of the 
Environment's $8.8 million Clean Air and 
Urban Landscapes initiative. 
This article has focused upon the openly 
accessible aggregate data; however, many 
urban researchers face considerable challenges 
in accessing disaggregated (unit-level) data-
sets. The <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform has capabilities 
for secure data access and usage. These are 
described in more detail in Ma (2015). 
Furthermore, many researchers require access 
to real-time information on the state of cities. 
Social media is one example of data that can 
capture what is happening in cities at any given 
time. Future work on <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> will include data 
from organisations such as Twitter. 
Future work on <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> involves the 
extension of the platform to include more 
datasets, and importantly, more recent datasets; 
for example, the 2016 Census. Work is also 
ongoing in supporting an open application 
programming interface for direct program-
matic access to the data and tools within the 
platform. Initial prototyping of mobile appli-
cations has already commenced in both the <rs type="software">iOS</rs> 
and <rs type="software">Android</rs> platforms (Moran 1950; Zhang 
2015). 
One of the challenges facing <rs type="software">AURIN</rs> is its 
longer term sustainability. In 2015, the project 
faced challenges due to the economic uncer-
tainty of the national funding landscape. As a 
result, certain commercial (fee-for-use) data-
sets, such as the Fairfax Australian Property 
Monitor housing data, had to be withdrawn due 
to lack of funds. These datasets were amongst 
the most widely accessed and used within the 
<rs type="software">AURIN</rs> platform. Despite the obvious uptake 
of the platform by the research community and 
technical sophistication of the solution, such°C </p>

<p><rs type="software">RNALocate</rs>ABSTRACT </p>

<p>Increasing evidence has revealed that RNA subcellu-
lar localization is a very important feature for deeply 
understanding RNA's biological functions after be-
ing transported into intra-or extra-cellular regions. 
RNALocate is a web-accessible database that aims 
to provide a high-quality RNA subcellular localiza-
tion resource and facilitate future researches on RNA 
function or structure. The current version of RNALo-
cate documents more than 37 700 manually curated 
RNA subcellular localization entries with experimen-
tal evidence, involving more than 21 800 RNAs with 
42 subcellular localizations in 65 species, mainly in-
cluding Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Saccha-
romyces cerevisiae etc. Besides, RNA homology, se-
quence and interaction data have also been inte-
grated into <rs type="software">RNALocate</rs>. Users can access these data 
through online search, browse, blast and visualiza-
tion tools. In conclusion, <rs type="software">RNALocate</rs> will be of help in 
elucidating the entirety of RNA subcellular localiza-
tion, and developing new prediction methods. The 
database is available at http://www.rna-society.org/ 
rnalocate/. </p>

<p>gene expression regulation or mitosis etc (4). Thus, the cel-
lular role of the RNA after synthesis could be inferred from 
its subcellular localization information. Based on this, sub-
cellular localization for RNAs plays an important role in 
studying biological function of RNAs. Therefore, it is ur-
gent to construct a database of RNA subcellular localiza-
tion to integrate, analyze and predict RNA subcellular lo-
calization for speeding up RNA structural and functional 
research. 
To complement with related research in RNA subcellu-
lar localization, we developed a web-accessible database 
(<rs id="software-5" type="software">RNALocate</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.rna-society.org/rnalocate</rs>/), 
aimed to collect expanding catalog of diverse species' RNA 
subcellular localization in multiple biological processes 
by manually curating the literature. The first release of 
RNALocate has contained more than 37 700 manually 
curated RNA subcellular localization entries with exper-
imental evidence, involving 65 organisms (such as Homo 
sapiens, Musmusculus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), 42 
subcellular localizations (such as Cytoplasm, Nucleus, 
Endoplasmic reticulum, Ribosome) and 9 RNA categories 
(such as mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA). Hence, <rs type="software">RNALocate</rs> 
provides a more specific subcellular localization resource 
in which to efficiently investigate, browse and analyze 
a particular RNA, and even provides insight into the 
functions of hypothetical or novel RNAs. The whole data 
set can be easily queried and downloaded through the 
webpage, and visualization tools for interactively browsing 
and analyzing the data set are provided. In addition, 
<rs type="software">RNALocate</rs> also allows researchers to submit new RNA 
subcellular localization. </p>

<p>In order to collect all available RNAs, <rs type="software">RNALocate</rs> inte-
grates all types of RNA symbols, mainly including mi-
croRNA symbols from the miRBase database (5), long non-
coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA symbols from NCBI 
Gene and <rs type="software">Ensemble genome database</rs> (6,7). Other ncRNA 
category names are also included, such as transfer RNA 
and small nuclear RNA from <rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">NCBI</rs> <rs id="software-9" type="software">Gene</rs> and Ensemble 
genome database (6,7). The list of subcellular localization 
names was collected according to the Gene Ontology (GO) 
(8). We have written a simple script to screen all abstracts 
and articles in the <rs type="software">PubMed database</rs> using the following 
keyword combinations: (each RNA symbol or RNA cate-
gory name) and/or (each subcellular localization). The rel-
evant hits were further inspected manually. Besides, we also 
retrieved several thousand subcellular localization entries 
from <rs type="software">lncRNAdb</rs> (9), <rs type="software">PomBase</rs> (10), <rs type="software">FlyBase</rs> (11), <rs type="software">TAIR</rs> 
(12) and <rs type="software">DOT</rs> (13) databases (Figure 1). 
The <rs type="software">RNALocate</rs> database is implemented using HTML 
and PHP languages with <rs type="software">MySQL server</rs>. The interface com-
ponent consists of web pages designed and implemented in 
HTML/CSS. It has been tested in the <rs type="software">Google Chrome</rs>, Fire-
fox and <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> web browsers. </p>

<p>RNA subcellular localization information was manually 
obtained from articles published in the <rs type="software">PubMed</rs> database </p>

<p>before May 2016. In current version, <rs type="software">RNALocate</rs> docu-
ments 37 772 RNA subcellular localization entries with ex-
perimental evidence from 65 organisms, involving 42 sub-
cellular localizations (Figure 2) and 9 RNA categories 
(including csRNA, lncRNA, mRNA, miRNA, piRNA, 
snRNA, rRNA, snoRNA and tRNA) (Figure 3). Among 
these, more than 1400 entries were collected from lncR-
NAdb, <rs type="software">PomBase</rs>, <rs type="software">FlyBase</rs>, <rs type="software">TAIR</rs> and <rs type="software">DOT</rs> databases. Each 
subcellular localization entry contains detailed informa-
tion on RNA symbol, RNA category, alias, organism, se-
quence, homology, subcellular localization, tissue, valida-
tion method, PubMed ID, detailed description and net-
work. 
In 'Submit' page, RNALocate invites users to upload 
novel RNA subcellular localization data, and in 'Blast' 
page, sequence alignment can be done after parameter se-
lection. Except these, the whole data set could be down-
loaded through two approaches: 'Basic Download' and 
'API' (application programming interface). In 'Basic Down-
load' page, the whole data are saved in <rs corresp="#software-29" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> <rs id="software-29" type="software">Excel</rs> and 
TXT formats, users can get them by clicking the download 
button. In 'API' page, users can access part of RNALo-
cate data by using script. RNALocate also provides three 
options in 'Help' page to supply instructions for using it, 
including 'Statistics' (detailed statistical tables), 'Tutorial' 
(procedure and illustrations of RNALocate) and 'Sister 
Databases'. </p>

<p><rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs>ABSTRACT </p>

<p><rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> is a new software for multiple alignment 
of nucleic acid sequences, which are recognized to 
be hard to align. The idea is that the multiple align-
ment process should be improved by taking into 
account the putative function of the sequences. In 
this perspective, MAGNOLIA is especially designed 
for sequences that are intended to be either protein-
coding or structural RNAs. It extracts information 
from the similarities and differences in the data, and 
searches for a specific evolutionary pattern between 
sequences before aligning them. The alignment step 
then incorporates this information to achieve higher 
accuracy. The website is available at http://bioinfo. 
lifl.fr/magnolia. </p>

<p>More and more newly sequenced genomes are becoming 
available every week. Tiling arrays are also gaining 
popularity for detecting novel transcripts in sequenced 
genomes. In this context, sequence annotation is an 
essential step in understanding the genome and the tran-
scriptome of a species. Comparative genomics has proven 
to be a promising approach to address this problem. 
Large-scale comparisons of prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
genomes reveal thousands of conserved regions obtained 
by homology or synteny. These regions might be protein-
coding sequences (1) or non-coding RNA genes (2,3,4). 
Annotation by comparative analysis typically involves 
two steps: first aligning the sequences, then analysing 
the multiple alignment to detect an evolutionary pattern 
that is representative of the selection pressure. This idea 
is exploited in <rs type="software">Exoniphy</rs> (5) for exon detection, in <rs type="software">RNAz</rs> 
(6) or <rs type="software">Evofold</rs> (7) for structural RNA prediction or in 
Qrna (8), that implements both a coding and an non-
coding model for RNAs. In this computational protocol, 
high-quality sequence alignment is an essential pre-
requisite step. This task, however, is difficult because 
sequence similarity is often reduced at the nucleic level. </p>

<p>Regarding protein coding genes, nucleic acid sequences 
exhibit a much larger sequence heterogeneity compared to 
their encoded amino acid sequences due to the redundancy 
of the genetic code. It is well known that the combination 
of nucleic acid and amino acid sequence information 
leads to improved alignments (9,10). The same situation 
holds for non-coding RNA genes. The spatial structure 
evolves slower than its primary structure. So pure-
sequence-based multiple alignment tools perform poorly 
on low-homology datasets of structural RNAs (11). In 
this article, we present the <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> website, whose 
objective is to provide an advanced tool for aligning 
nucleic acid sequences. The idea is to get rid of the 
dichotomy between aligning and predicting the function. 
If we assume that sequences are either protein-coding or 
structural RNAs, it is possible to incorporate some 
functional information into the alignment algorithm to 
improve the result. The multiple alignment can then be 
used as a starting point to refine the comparative analysis 
or to carry out further predictions, such as motif finding 
or phylogeny reconstruction. </p>

<p>The method has two steps. First, it tries to predict the 
function of the sequences according to the substitution 
pattern between sequences. Second, a multiple alignment 
is built based on the putative function of the sequences. If 
the sequences are recognized as coding sequences, then the 
multiple alignment uses the amino acid sequences. If the 
sequences are recognized to contain a conserved second-
ary structure, then the mutiple alignment takes into 
consideration long-range base pair interactions. 
<rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> includes three specific modules: <rs type="software">Protea</rs> 
for protein coding sequences, <rs type="software">caRNAc</rs> and <rs type="software">gardenia</rs> for 
structural RNAs. The overall scenario is summed up in 
Figure 1. 
<rs type="software">Protea</rs> implements an evolutionary model for protein-
coding sequences (12). Here the idea is that the selection 
pressure tends to preserve the encoded amino acid 
sequence, and it is possible to identifies coding sequences 
by looking for a global conservation of common </p>

<p>reading frames. The method first identifies best potential 
reading frames from each pair of sequences, and then 
incorporates this information into a frame graph from 
which a coding significancy score is calculated. By 
doing so, it also predicts the associated reading frame for 
each sequence. If the sequences are classified as protein-
coding sequences, then the multiple alignment of nucleic 
acid sequences is built from the hypothetical amino 
acid sequences using <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs> (13), <rs id="software-29" type="software">Dialign</rs><rs corresp="#software-29" type="version-number">2</rs> (10) or 
<rs type="software">T-coffee</rs> (14). <rs type="software">caRNAc</rs> is for structural RNA genes (15). In 
this model, the selection pressure tends to preserve the 
secondary structure of the molecule, and mutations should 
retain the ability to form base pairs into energetically 
favorable stems. 
<rs type="software">caRNAc</rs> is able to recover a conserved secondary struc-
ture from a set of unaligned sequences. This idea is also 
present in refs. (16,17), that fold and align several 
sequences at the same time, for example. But these pro-
grams are still computationally demanding. We circum-
vent the problem by using a heuristics approach. The 
algorithm uses a Sankoff-based dynamic programing 
approach to identify conserved strutures for all pairs of 
sequences. Then all pairwise foldings are combined into 
a graph-theoretical structure called the stem graph. 
Only frequent common stems that correspond to highly 
connected subgraphs in the stem graph are retained. 
<rs type="software">Gardenia</rs> is used to build the multiple alignment for 
potential structural RNA sequences. The method takes 
into account both the nucleic sequence and the putative 
common secondary structure predicted by <rs type="software">caRNAc</rs>. It 
relies on the dynamic programming algorithm for pair-
wise comparison proposed in ref. (18). RNA sequences are 
encoded as arc-annotated sequences, and a multiple align-
ment for a set of arc-annotated sequences is a nested 
common supersequence. The edit scheme incorporates 
evolutionary operations concerning free bases (base 
substitution, base deletion) and base pairs (arc-mismatch, 
arc-removing, arc-breaking, arc-altering), originally 
defined in ref. (19). It is easy to show that this problem 
is NP-hard. We take a heuristic approach and use a </p>

<p>progressive method. The method starts with constructing 
all pairwise alignments to determine the degree of 
similarity for each pair of sequences. Then it combines 
sequences into a multiple alignment by an ascending 
hierarchical clustering. Pairwise alignment of super-
sequences rely on the same algorithm as pairwise 
alignments for arc-annotated sequences. This is made 
possible because supersequences can be viewed as a nested 
arc-annotated sequences on an extended alphabet. The 
score of one node is its SP (sum-of-pairs) score. Lastly, the 
space search of the dynamic programming alignment is 
pruned using constraints coming from the <rs type="software">caRNAc</rs> 
output. This provides a significant speed up. </p>

<p><rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> requires as input data a set of RNA or 
DNA sequences in the standard FASTA format. This set 
should contain at least two distinct sequences and at most 
ten sequences. It can be stored in a file to be uploaded to 
the server, or pasted directly in the text box. </p>

<p>A typical run of <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> takes a few seconds. 
Upon completion of a job, <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> displays the 
result on a new web page. The job assigned a unique 
identifier that can be used to retrieve results for one week. 
All results are available for download in <rs type="software">Clustal</rs> and 
bracket-dot format. 
If input sequences are annotated as coding sequences, 
then two multiple alignments are displayed. The first 
alignment is built on the putative amino acid sequences 
obtained by virtual translation using the predicted reading 
frame, and the second alignment is the corresponding 
alignment on nucleic acid sequences obtained by reverse 
translation, allowing for frameshifts. Codons in the nucleic 
acid sequences are put in color: two base triplets coding for </p>

<p>Figure 1. <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> scenario. </p>

<p>the same amino acid bear the same color. The color choice 
is inspired from the <rs type="software">RasMol</rs> amino acid color scheme. 
Figure 2 shows an example of <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> output 
obtained with a family of protein-coding sequences. 
If input sequences are annotated as structural RNA 
genes, then a multiple alignment taking into consideration 
the primary structure accompanied by the secondary 
structure is displayed. Concerning the secondary struc-
ture, base pairings are indicated in bracket-dot format: 
Each base-pair is represented by a pair of matching 
brackets and unpaired bases are represented by dots. The 
lack of pseudoknots in the secondary structure ensures 
that this notation defines a unique folding. Moreover, 
stems in the alignment are highlighted in colors. Figure 3 
shows an example of output obtained with a family of 
non-coding RNAs. For each sequence, the individual 
putative secondary structure is also provided in five 
formats: CT, JPEG, PS, bracket-dot format and as a list 
of constrained base pairings. JPEG and PS files are 
automatically produced from the CT file using the 
<rs type="software">NAview</rs> layout program (22). 
Some data sets are not identified as coding RNAs nor as 
non-coding RNAs. The first possibility is that the 
sequences might have an alternative function, such as 
untranslated regions in messenger RNAs, promoter 
elements, etc. The second possibility is that the sequences 
are highly conserved. In this context, the comparative 
analysis approach used by <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> is not suitable. 
The evolutionary signal is too weak and the sequences do 
not exhibit any significant mutational bias towards any 
model. This is an intrinsic limitation of the method. But 
this limitation is harmless for practical purposes, because 
standard multiple sequence alignment tools usually yield 
good results on high-identity data sets. So when the 
average identity percentage is greater than 90%, the server 
outputs a warning message and provides a default 
multiple alignment constructed directly with <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs> 
on the initial data set. 
One final point worth mentioning is that the classifica-
tion is not mutually exclusive. Some sequences might 
contain conserved secondary structure elements within a 
coding region. Two such examples are the cis-acting </p>

<p>regulatory element from the human rhinoviruses, that is 
located in the open reading frame of the capsid proteins 
[RFAM -RF00220 (21)], or the Hepatitis C stem-loop 
VII structure found in the coding region of the RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase gene NS5B [RFAM -
RF000468 (21)]. In such cases, <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> releases 
two multiple alignments. </p>

<p>For each family, we selected a subset of four sequences at 
random. It remains 6491 families, whose average sequence 
length is 604 bp. 6122 (94.3%) families are correctly 
classified as coding sequences, among them more than 
99% with the correct reading frame predicted for each 
sequence. Less than 3% of the families are classified as 
structural RNA. To estimate the quality of the alignments, 
we used the sum-of-pairs score (SPS) of the <rs type="software">Baliscore</rs> 
software (23). The SPS is calculated such that it increases 
with the number of sequences correctly aligned. We 
compared <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> with <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs>, <rs type="software">T-coffee</rs> and 
<rs type="software">Dialign2</rs> on the same nucleic acid sequences. Results are 
displayed in Figure 4. </p>

<p>This benchmark contains 388 alignments, that are 
classified into high, medium and low identity data sets. 
<rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> failed to identify a structural evolutionary 
pattern for 20% of them and falsely assigned a protein 
coding function for 7% of them. Following ref. (11), we 
use the structure conservation index (SCI) to assess the </p>

<p>accuracy of alignments. This score provides a measure of 
the conserved secondary structure information contained 
within the alignment. Results for <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> are 
reported in Figure 5, together with results for other 
alignment tools used in the benchmark. We also evaluated 
the accuracy of the secondary structure found by 
<rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> and compared it to two recent structural 
alignment programs: <rs type="software">Murlet</rs> (16) and <rs type="software">Mlocarna</rs> (17). For 
each <rs type="software">software</rs> and for each identity class, we computed the 
percentage of correct base pairings amongst the set of 
predicted base pairings. Results are shown in Table 1. It 
appears that <rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> has similar performances as 
<rs type="software">Murlet</rs> and outperforms <rs type="software">Mlocarna</rs>. Furthermore, the 
total runtime is more than 12 times faster for 
<rs type="software">MAGNOLIA</rs> than for the two other methods (&lt; 20 min 
for the whole data set, compared to more than 4 hours). </p>

and <rs type="software">Dialign2</rs>. For <rs type="software">Dialign2</rs>, we selected the appropriate option

<p>Participants were asked to provide a buccal swab sample for

Pairwise tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, 
r 2 ≥0.8) with a minor allele frequency ≥5% were selected for 
CRH, CRHBP, CRHR1, POMC, MC2R, NR3C1 and SERPINA6 
and their 10 kb fl anking regions using <rs type="software">Tagger</rs>. 24 SNPs were geno-
typed using Sequenom MassARRAY technology following the

<p>Sample and assay quality control thresholds were set to 90%. 
Allele frequencies were checked for consistency with HapMap

SNPs were tested for association with CWP using the Cochran-
Armitage trend test. Where there was no evidence of a trend 
association, recessive and dominant models of association were 
tested using a χ 2 test. Logistic regression was used to estimate 
odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI. 
Haplotype structure was determined using the confi dence 
bounds method in <rs type="software">Haploview</rs>. 26 The expectation-maximisation 
algorithm was used to estimate haplotype frequencies. The 
overall distribution of haplotypes was compared between 
patients with CWP and pain-free controls using a χ 2 test. The 
frequency of each individual haplotype was also compared to 
the combined frequency of the other haplotypes between cases 
and controls using the χ 2 test. Haplotype inference and associa-
tion testing was conducted in <rs type="software">PLINK</rs>. 27

<p>unique industry covering areas from auto repair to fast

2004: 2). 
Mystery shopping got its start as a way to check on em-
ployee integrity and minimize theft primarily in the finan-
cial services industry. In the 1990's, fuelled by the internet, 
the mystery shopping industry experienced rapid growth 
and acceptance. Into the 2000's, the creation of software 
packages such as <rs type="software">SASSIE</rs> and <rs type="software">Prophet</rs> have revolutionized 
the industry (Michelson 1997, 2004: 6). </p>

<p>and each tube was vortexed briefly before acquiring the samples. Gallios 
Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) was used to acquire the data 
by gating on the beads. Cells were quantified using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Kaluza analysis</rs> soft-
ware (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Beckman Coulter</rs>), and the formula provided by the bead manufac-
turer was used to calculate the absolute number of cells (Life Technologies 
Corporation). </p>

<p>Bladder tissue was fixed and processed as described (Khandelwal 
et al., 2008); however, the Rab8 antibody only reacted if the follow-
ing procedure was followed. After the frozen tissue was cross-
sectioned and rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), we 
performed antigen retrieval by incubating the tissue for 7 min with 
quench buffer (20 mM glycine, pH 8.0, and 75 mM NH 4 Cl dissolved 
in PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. This was followed by a 3-min 
incubation in quench buffer containing 0.05% SDS and 0.1% Triton 
X-100. The tissue was then quickly rinsed three times with PBS and 
then three times for 5 min in the same buffer. When mounting the 
tissues, we found that enhanced image quality could be obtained if 
postfixation the tissues were rinsed with 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 
then treated for 1-2 min each with ascending concentrations of 
thiodiethanol (50, 75, and 97% [vol/vol]) dissolved in the same buf-
fer (Staudt et al., 2007). The samples were then mounted in 97% 
thiodiethanol/Tris buffer containing 0.01% (wt/vol) phenylenedi-
amine and stored at −20°C. The 97% thiodiethanol has the same 
refractive index as our immersion oil (1.1518). Although this solution 
worked well for proteins labeled with secondary antibodies, tetram-
ethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin and To-Pro3 were quickly 
leached out the samples, necessitating the use of our standard 
glycerol-based mounting medium for these markers (Acharya et al., 
2004). Images were captured using an HCX PL APO 63×/numerical 
aperture (NA) 1.3 glycerol objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) or a 
Leica STED 100×/NA 1.4 oil objective and the appropriate laser 
lines of a Leica TCS SP5 CW-STED confocal microscope (in normal 
confocal mode). The photomultipliers were set at 900-1200, and 
8-bit images were collected using four to eight line averages com-
bined with four to eight frame averages. Serial 0.25-μm z-sections 
were acquired. The images were imported into <rs id="software-0" type="software">Volocity 4D</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">PerkinElmer</rs>, Waltham, MA) and, after image reconstruction, 
exported as TIFF files. The contrast of the latter was corrected in 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">Photoshop CS5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Adobe</rs>, San Jose, CA), and the composite images 
were prepared in <rs type="software">Adobe Illustrator CS5</rs>. 
Measures of colocalization were performed using <rs type="software">Volocity</rs> soft-
ware, and Manders' colocalization coefficients were calculated as 
previously described (Khandelwal et al., 2008). Briefly, stacks of 
dual-labeled confocal sections were imported into <rs type="software">Volocity</rs>, back-
ground noise was removed using the fine (3 × 3) median noise re-
duction filter, and a scatter plot of green and red pixel intensities 
(associated with each of the two markers in question) was generated 
using the colocalization function. A constant threshold of 40 was 
applied to both channels of the image stack, and Manders' colocal-
ization coefficients for each of two markers (M X and M Y , respec-
tively) were calculated for the entire three-dimensional image stack 
using the following equations (Manders et al., 1993): </p>

<p>Bladder tissue was isolated and then fixed with 2.0% (vol/vol) glu-
taraldehyde and 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in 100 mM sodium 
cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM 
CaCl 2 for 60 min. The tissue was then cut into small pieces, washed 
with 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, cut into small blocks 
(2-5 mm in size), and then postfixed in 1.0% (wt/vol) OsO 4 and 
1.0% (wt/vol) K 4 Fe(CN) 6 , in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. 
After a wash with water, the samples were en bloc stained over-
night in 0.5% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate. The tissues were then dehy-
drated in a graded series of ethanol, and after incubation in pro-
pylene oxide, embedded in the epoxy resin LX-112 (Ladd, 
Burlington, VT) and cured 2 d at 60°C. Embedded tissue was 
sectioned with a diamond knife (Diatome, Fort Washington, PA), 
and sections, silver to pale gold in color, were mounted on Butvar-
coated nickel grids, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead cit-
rate, and viewed at 80 kV in a 100 CX electron microscope (JEOL, 
Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured using an L9C Peltier-cooled 
transmission electron microscopy camera system (Scientific Instru-
ments and Applications, Duluth, GA). Digital images were im-
ported into <rs type="software">Adobe Lightroom</rs>, and the images were processed by 
using the brightness, contrast, and clarity controls. When contrast 
was too low, adjustments to the tone curve were made to the 
whole image. Images were sharpened using a radius of 0.5, and 
luminance noise reduction was performed. The composite images 
were assembled using <rs type="software">Adobe Illustrator CS5</rs>. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> (protein flexibility analyzer) web server 
detects and displays conformational changes in 
remotely related proteins, without relying on 
sequence homology. To do so, it first applies a 
reliable statistical test to align core protein frag-
ments that are structurally similar and then clusters 
these aligned fragment pairs into 'super-alignments', 
according to the similarity of geometric transforma-
tions that align them. The result is that the dominant 
conformational changes occur between the clusters, 
while the smaller conformational changes occur 
within a cluster. <rs id="software-4" type="software">pFlexAna</rs> is available at <rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">http://bigbird.comp.nus.edu.sg/pfa2</rs>/. </p>

<p>The crystallographers who determined the WWP1 struc-
ture described in detail its comparison with E6AP (3), and 
they produced several figures depicting superpositions 
carried out manually, similar to what <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> produces 
automatically. To our knowledge, there are currently no 
other computational tools that aim to automate such 
analyses. 
Our <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> (protein flexibility analyzer) web server 
aims at automatically detecting conformational changes 
between a pair of protein structures, without relying on 
sequence homology. Specifically, it detects regions exhibit-
ing structural change, contrasted with regions exhibiting 
structural similarity. The <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> results can be viewed 
as indications of the endpoints of hypothesized molecular 
motions or mutation-induced conformational changes. 
To detect conformational changes in dissimilar proteins, 
we must first find structurally similar fragments (domains, 
sub-domains, etc.) in the proteins. <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> employs a 
statistical test to match core protein fragments that are 
structurally similar and determine the geometric transfor-
mations that align them. This statistical test of structural 
similarity has been shown to be effective in detecting many 
different types of conformational changes (4). <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> 
displays the protein structures superimposed according to 
each aligned fragment pair. The superimposed display 
highlights the discontinuity from the similar to the dis-
similar regions of the proteins and aids visualization of 
the conformational changes that occur relative to the 
aligned fragment pair used as the basis for superposition. 
See Figure 3 for a sample result. Furthermore, <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> 
clusters the aligned fragment pairs into 'super-alignments', 
according to the similarity of geometric transformations 
that align them. The result is that the dominant conforma-
tional changes occur between the clusters, while the smaller 
conformational changes occur within a cluster. 
There are many approaches for studying conforma-
tional changes. One possibility is to perform molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulation to generate alternative con-
formations from a single known protein structure (5). 
However, MD simulation is computationally intensive, </p>

<p>align the entire structures together without recognizing the 
hinge-like conformational change occurring between the 
two domains of the protein. FlexProt (14), on the other 
hand, requires the user to know the number of hinges in 
order to interpret its results. What we need in this case is 
a method that automatically detects the 'discontinuity' in 
structural similarity at the hinge due to the conforma-
tional change and matches the two domains on each side 
of the hinge separately. See Figure 2 for a comparison 
between the results from FATCAT and <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs>. In 
general, <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> aims to detect such conformational 
changes for two related, but different proteins. Further-
more, it tries to identify and group together those protein 
fragments that move in tandem. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> server takes as input two protein structures 
in PDB format, which may be uploaded or specified using 
PDB codes. The user may also specify chain identifiers or 
a restricted range of residues for each file. Finally, there 
are two optional parameters that the user may adjust. The 
parameter k is the desired number of clusters for grouping </p>

<p>Figure 1. Superposition of the structures of ubiquitin ligases WWWP1 and E6AP. The two different superpositions, produced automatically by 
<rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs>, are obtained by aligning a pair of fragments (marked in red and green) with high structural similarity. Dotted ovals annotate the parts of 
the proteins that are well aligned in the superpositions. To see the magnitude of the conformational change, note that the pose of E6AP (blue) 
remains the same in both (a) and (b). Only the pose of WWWP1 (orange) changes. </p>

<p>the aligned fragments together, and is the noise param-
eter, which determines how strictly structural similarity is 
applied. For low -values, <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> matches only frag-
ments that are highly similar. For high -values, it also 
matches fragments with weak similarity and ignores small 
differences. Based on our experiences, -values between 
0.2 and 0.4 work well for proteins with reasonably high-
sequence homology (40% or higher). For proteins that are 
even more distantly related, we find -values up to 0.8 to 
be useful as well, though this may lead to false positive 
matches in some cases. </p>

<p><rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> identifies pairs of fragments-one fragment 
from each protein-that show significant conformational 
similarity. They are listed in a table and grouped into 
clusters, according to the similarity of the geometric 
transformation that aligns the fragment pair. See Figure 3 
for an example. Two or more fragment pairs may move 
together and form a semi-rigid domain. By categorizing 
fragment pairs that are moving together versus moving 
independently, clustering helps to characterize conforma-
tional changes caused by domain movements or correlated 
motions. 
For each aligned fragment pair, <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> provides a 
static cartoon of the proteins superimposed according to

proteins with respect to the aligned regions. Jmol links are </p>

<p>To analyze the conformational changes between two 
protein structures, <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> proceeds in two main steps. 
In the first step, it identifies pairs of fragments that are 
structurally similar. These fragment pairs serve as rigid 
cores for superimposing the two proteins and detecting 
conformational changes with respect to the cores. In the 
second step, <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> clusters the aligned fragment pairs 
into 'super-alignments', according to the similarity of 
geometric transformations that align two fragments in a 
pair. The result is that the dominant conformational 
changes occur between the clusters, while the smaller 
conformational changes occur within a cluster. We now 
describe the two steps in greater detail below. 
To identify structurally similar fragment pairs, 
<rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> uses an all-against-all approach that effectively 
compares every contiguous fragment from one protein 
with that from the other. First, we match the residues of 
the two proteins by 'sliding' one protein against the other 
(Figure 4). For each sliding position, let P and P 
0 represent 
the matched residues from the two proteins, respectively. 
We generate all contiguous fragments of P and P 
0 and 
check their structural similarity by applying a reliable 
statistical test (4). Briefly, this test uses a Gaussian noise 
model to represent acceptable deviations in atomic 
coordinates between two putatively similar protein frag-
ments. Two fragments are considered statistically different 
if their coordinates deviate too much according to the 
Gaussian model. We then assign to each residue a 
flexibility score that incorporates information from all 
fragment comparisons that involve this residue. A high 
score indicates greater rigidity. Finally, each pair of 
aligned fragments must pass the following filter: the 
fragments must consist entirely of residues whose flex-
ibility scores are above a threshold, and they must be 
longer than a given minimum length. Intuitively, this filter 
ensures that such a pair of fragments and all sub-
fragments contained in them are structurally identical up 
to statistical variations. The minimum length requirement 
is imposed to avoid accidental structural matches. One 
advantage of our method is that it highlights the genuine 
conformational changes by suppressing the spurious ones 
due to noise. More details on this method and its 
advantages are available in ref. (4). Since we perform an </p>

<p>exhaustive comparison of all contiguous fragments in the 
two protein structures, our method can detect structurally 
similar fragments that are in opposite order along the 
protein sequences. 
After obtaining an exhaustive list of structurally similar 
fragment pairs, we need to resolve the conflicts among 
them. A conflict occurs if in the list of matched fragment 
pairs, a residue from one protein is matched with multiple 
residues from the other protein. In practice, we have found 
that biologically significant matches have much longer 
fragment length than the spurious ones due to accidental 
structural similarity. So we remove the conflicts in the list 
by preferring fragment pairs with longer length. 
Finally, <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> hierarchically clusters the fragment 
pairs. The idea is to treat each structurally similar fragment 
pair as a point and divide these points into k clusters so 
that the dominant structural differences occur across 
clusters. To do this, we build a similarity graph. The ver-
tices of this graph correspond to the fragment pairs 
obtained after conflict resolution. There is an edge between 
every two vertices, and the associated edge weight rep-
resents the similarity between the fragment pairs corre-
sponding to the two vertices. Here, similarity is defined as 
the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the best 
superposition when the two fragment pairs are combined. 
After constructing the similarity graph, we recursively 
remove from the graph the edge with the greatest weight 
and thus separate the most dissimilar fragment pairs, 
which represent the largest structural difference. We con-
tinue this edge removal process until the graph breaks into 
k connected components. 
The web server implementation of our method uses 
PHP for its front-end interface, C++ for back-end pro-
cessing, and a Ruby daemon to interface the front and 
back ends. The output images are generated using <rs type="software">PyMol</rs> 
(15) and interactive displays of each alignment are pro-
vided using <rs type="software">Jmol</rs> (16). </p>

<p>We illustrate the results of <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> on several repre-
sentative cases. </p>

<p>The crystal structures of the E6AP and WWP1 ubiquitin 
ligases [PDB codes 1D5F:C (2) and 1ND7 (3)] display a 
striking example of domain movement (Figure 1). 
<rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> finds six core regions of significant structural 
similarity between the proteins and successfully clusters 
them into two domains which move independently (see 
Figure 1). These images are obtained directly from the web 
server, but annotated with an arrow and dotted ovals to 
draw attention to the domains that are aligned. The 
relative movement between the domains has been char-
acterized as a 100 degree sweep with a 30 degree tilt (3). 
Superpositions, such as those shown in Figure 1, help to 
highlight the context of each protein region undergoing 
conformation change. 
Superpositions of similar regions, as shown in Figure 1, 
are ideal for visualization because they show the difference 
as a divergence from a fixed reference point. Beyond 
simply showing the context of each 'flexible' region, each 
superposition indicates a transition from similar (rigid) to 
different (flexible). </p>

<p>The ubiquitin ligases have moderate sequence identity 
(&lt; 40%), but we have tested <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> on a range of pro-
tein pairs with low sequence identity such as the isomerase 
domain of glucosamine 6P synthase [1MOQ (17)] and 
arabinose binding protein [8ABP (18)], which have 10% 
sequence identity. Figure 5 shows the alignments of 
1MOQ and 8ABP. <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> finds two independent 
domains. Each aligned domain centers around a parallel 
b-sheet buried by a-helices. In this figure, each align-
ment is rotated for viewing down the plane of an aligned 
sheet. To see the magnitude of the domain movement, 
note that the N-terminal domain of 8ABP (magenta) 
appears in the upper-right of both views, and 1MOQ 
(orange) is dramatically shifted between the two 
alignments. </p>

<p><rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> is particularly useful for proteins exhibiting 
domain moments, but applying it to proteins with more 
subtle conformational changes and without major domain 
movements can also be informative. In particular, we set 
parameter k = 1 when we expect only a single cluster 
corresponding to the aligned protein core. For example, 
Figure 6 compares two PX domain proteins [1KMD (19) 
and 1GD5 (20)]. The N-and C-termini of the two proteins 
are conserved, but the loop region in between contains 
several insertions/deletions. Most structural alignment 
methods attempt to align these two proteins by super-
imposing their entire backbones globally. While this may 
be useful for some purposes, single global alignments may 
be skewed as they include the loop region. A more 
informative view of the evolutionary impact on conforma-
tional structure is shown by aligning only the conserved 
segments. On the PX domains, <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> automatically 
finds the fragments of tightest similarity, distinct from the 
loop region, and it presents the clustered alignment result 
without skew from the inserted amino acids. </p>

<p><rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> is a new tool for protein structure comparison. 
It detects and displays conformational changes in 
remotely related proteins, without relying on sequence 
homology. Our tests show that <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> helps in anal-
yzing a wide variety of conformational changes. It can 
detect conformational changes in proteins with identical 
sequences or those with very low sequence similarity. It 
can detect dramatic domain movements as well as smaller, 
more subtle conformational changes. 
The output of <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> helps the analysis of conforma-
tional changes in several ways. <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> uses a reliable 
statistical test of structural similarity to demarcate the 
protein regions that undergo conformational changes. It 
also clusters the protein fragments that move in tandem. 
The clustering helps in finding domains comprised of frag-
ments that are discontiguous and out of order along the 
sequences, e.g. in the case of the maltose-binding protein 
(Figure 3). Visualization of such information, provided 
in <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs>'s output, helps the user to scan for hinge 
locations, active binding sites, domain movements, etc. For </p>

<p>more detailed analysis, the user may use the quantitative 
information provided in <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs>'s output, e.g. use the 
provided transformation matrix for alignment to compute 
the angle of bending at a particular hinge. pFlexAna's 
output may also help users interested in predicting 
conformational motion. They may use the information 
that <rs type="software">pFlexAna</rs> provides as a starting point and combine it 
with other methods such as targeted molecular dynamics 
(21), where an MD simulation trajectory is 'directed' from 
an inital conformation towards an alternative target 
conformation. 
pFlexAna uses purely structural information to match 
two proteins. While this is often advantageous as it does 
not rely on sequence homology, it can potentially cause 
false positive matching. For example, for proteins with 
many secondary structure elements (SSEs), it is possible 
for unrelated long alpha helices or other common motifs 
comprised of multiple SSEs to be identified as aligned 
fragment pairs. Comparing glutamine amidotransferase 
(1MOQ) with a ubiquitin ligase (1ND7) matches two pairs 
of highly similar a-helices, with RMSD values of 
0.22 Å and 1.64 Å , respectively. While such aligned pairs 
are justified based on purely structural similarity, they 
may not be biologically significant to form a basis for 
inferring conformational changes. In the future, we 
intend to filter out such false positives by incorporating 
secondary structure or sequence information during the 
matching. </p>

using SsoAdvanced PreAmp Supermix as directed by the manufac-
turer (Cat# 1725160, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) diluted 
at least 5-fold and stored at −20 • C. PreAmp was performed with 
panels of assays which include PrimePCR PreAmp assays (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA), assays culled from public databases, 
assays designed using online software tools and assays from pub-
lished manuscripts (Supplemental Fig. 1); primers were at a final 
concentration of 50 nM each. Target genes were quantified by qPCR 
using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Cat# 1725270, 
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and CFX96 or CFX384 Real-

As a no-PreAmp control, stock cDNA was used to quantify gene tar-

<p>Background: Gene expression analysis has many applications in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic care. 
Relative quantification is the most widely adopted approach whereby quantification of gene expression is 
normalised relative to an endogenously expressed control (EC) gene. Central to the reliable determination of gene 
expression is the choice of control gene. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a panel of candidate EC genes 
from which to identify the most stably expressed gene(s) to normalise RQ-PCR data derived from primary 
colorectal cancer tissue. 
Results: The expression of thirteen candidate EC genes: B2M, HPRT, GAPDH, ACTB, PPIA, HCRT, SLC25A23, DTX3, 
APOC4, RTDR1, KRTAP12-3, CHRNB4 and MRPL19 were analysed in a cohort of 64 colorectal tumours and tumour 
associated normal specimens. CXCL12, FABP1, MUC2 and PDCD4 genes were chosen as target genes against which 
a comparison of the effect of each EC gene on gene expression could be determined. Data analysis using 
descriptive statistics, geNorm, <rs type="software">NormFinder</rs> and <rs type="software">qBasePlus</rs> indicated significant difference in variances between 
candidate EC genes. We determined that two genes were required for optimal normalisation and identified B2M 
and PPIA as the most stably expressed and reliable EC genes. </p>

<p>Scaled expression levels across the remaining nine can-
didate ECs analysed (figure 1) indicated within-gene dif-
ferences in expression between tumour and normal 
tissue groups in both SLC25A23 (p = 0.040) and 
CHRNB4 (P = 0.002) but not in the remaining genes (p 
&gt; 0.05), (figure 2A). Therefore, SLC25A23 and CHRNB4 
genes were excluded from further analysis. Significant 
differences in variance of EC expression were identified 
using Levene's test (p &lt; 0.001, figure 2B). These findings 
necessitated further evaluation of each candidate EC 
gene prior to their possible use to accurately quantitate 
gene expression levels of the target genes CXCL12, 
FABP1, MUC2 and PDCD4. 
The stability of candidate EC genes was analysed using 
geNorm [8] and <rs type="software">NormFinder</rs> [35] programmes. Stability 
was further evaluated using <rs id="software-5" type="software">qBasePlus</rs> [<rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">8,36</rs>], a commer-
cially available RQ-PCR data mining package. These 
programmes were used to calculate amplification effi-
ciency-corrected relative quantities from raw fluores-
cence data. The ranking of candidate EC genes as 
determined by each of these programmes is illustrated 
in Table 3. In the case of GeNorm the variable V indi-
cating the pairwise variation (Vn/Vn+1) between two 
sequential normalisation factors (NFn/NFn+1) indicated 
that three EC genes was the optimal number of genes 
for accurate normalisation (figure 2), however, target 
genes expression did not differ significantly if two rather 
than three EC genes were used (figure 3). Use of all 
three programmes confirmed that B2M and PPIA was 
the best combination of genes for normalising RQ-PCR 
data in CRC tissues (table 3). The Equivalence test [37] 
was used to examine the expression of candidate ECs. 
All genes were equivalently expressed between the nor-
mal and tumour colorectal tissues using a fold cut-off of 
2 (figure 4). </p>

<p>superior accuracy when due consideration is paid to the 
choice of EC genes. 
Many analytical programmes for relative quantification 
have been developed, certain of which enable the identi-
fication of EC genes from a study population [37,40,41]. 
In the present study the stability of expression of candi-
date EC genes was determined using a pair-wise com-
parison model: geNorm [8] and an <rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">MS</rs> <rs id="software-6" type="software">Excel</rs> ANOVA 
based model, <rs type="software">NormFinder</rs> [35]. No effect of disease sta-
tus EC gene expression was identified in colorectal tis-
sue. Since both geNorm and <rs type="software">NormFinder</rs> are based on 
the assumption that candidate genes are not differen-
tially expressed between samples, this was an important 
first step prior to their continued use [9,10]. 
In this study GeNorm was used to identify the most 
stably expressed EC genes from our panel of candidates </p>

<p>and also provided a measure of the optimal number of 
EC genes. B2M and PPIA were identified as the most 
stable pairing. In order to achieve a pair-wise variation 
value (V) below the cut-off of 0.15 additional genes 
should theoretically be used; however this cut-off point 
is not absolute [14] and may not always be achievable 
[42]. No significant difference in target gene expression 
was observed when the top three most stable EC genes 
identified by geNorm were used confirming that using 
of a pair of genes may be more practicable given cost, 
work load and sample availability considerations. 
<rs type="software">NormFinder</rs> was designed to identify EC genes with 
the lowest stability values; these values are calculated 
based on intra-and inter-group variation. In this study 
<rs type="software">NormFinder</rs> was used to define the best combination of 
genes using tumour and normal as group identifiers in </p>

<p>the calculations. MRPL19 was selected as the most 
stable gene using these criteria; however B2M and PPIA 
were highlighted as the best combination of genes with 
even lower stability value compared to MRPL19 alone. 
<rs type="software">QBasePlus</rs> real-time PCR data manager programme was 
developed based on geNorm and qBase [36] algorithms. 
<rs type="software">QBasePlus</rs> was used to confirm our selection of the 
B2M and PPIA pairing as the best combination of ECs 
in colorectal tissue. </p>

<p>For GeNorm, lower stability values (M) indicate greater stability. In the case of <rs type="software">NormFinder</rs>, stability is calculated from inter-and intra-group variation. By 
grouping the tissues into tumour and normal the best combination of genes was identified. For geNorm stability was based on the estimation of pair-wise 
variation. <rs type="software">QBasePlus</rs> through its components, geNorm and qBase, identified coefficient of variation (CV) and stability (M) values and thereby the best 
combination of genes for normalisation only when more than one gene is used. </p>

<p>Cycle threshold (C t ) is defined as the PCR cycle number 
at which the fluorescence generated from amplification 
of the target gene within a sample increases to a thresh-
old value of 10 times the standard deviation of the base 
line emission and is inversely proportionate to the start-
ing amount of the target cDNA. <rs type="software">QBasePlus</rs> was used for 
calculation of PDCD4 expression relative to each of the </p>

<p>EC genes. It applies ΔΔC t method was used where ΔΔCt 
= (C t target gene, test sample -C t endogenous control, 
test sample) -(C t target gene, calibrator sample -C t 
endogenous control, calibrator sample). Relative quanti-
ties were corrected for efficiency of amplification and 
fold change in gene expression between groups was cal-
culated as E-ΔΔCt ± s.e.m. Where more than one endo-
genous control are used, fold change estimates were 
calculated using the geometric mean of EC quantities 
relative to the calibrator sample which could be the 
minimum, maximum or a named sample or an average. 
Stability of the EC genes expression was evaluated 
with two freely available statistical models, geNorm and 
<rs type="software">NormFinder</rs>. It is further validated with <rs type="software">qBasePlus</rs>. Sta-
tistical analysis was carried out with <rs id="software-10" type="software">Minitab</rs>® <rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">15</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">Mini-tab Ltd.</rs>, Coventry, UK). Anderson-Darling normality test 
was applied and parametric tests were used where 
appropriate. The equivalence test was used to assess the 
equivalently of expression of the candidate genes 
between tumour and normal tissues. One-way ANOVA, 
two-sample t-test, Levene's test and Spearman and Pear-
son correlations were used to determine association and 
comparisons between groups. P values &lt; 0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant. </p>

<p>tured in monolayers, the two-fold serial dilutions of Chinese 
crude drugs and 100 TCID 50 NDV were added to the cell 
plates, respectively, using three different methods: 
Pre-addition of the drug: Baicalin solution was first added 
to CEFs at 100 µl per well (four wells per concentration). 
After incubation for 4 hr, the baicalin solution was removed, 
cells were washed twice with PBS, and 100 µl of the virus 
solution was added to each well. 
Post-addition of the drug: The virus solution was added 
to the CEFs first. After incubation for 2 hr, baicalin solu-
tion was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS, and 
baicalin solution was added to the wells (four wells each 
concentration). 
Simultaneous-addition of the drug and virus after mixing: 
Each concentration of baicalin solution was mixed with the 
virus solution, incubated for 2 hr at 37°C and then added to 
the CEFs (four wells for each concentration). At the same 
time, the NDV control group (virus only), cell control group 
(DMEM only) and the black group (no cells) were estab-
lished [32]. 
All CEF plates were placed in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 
37°C. After 72 hr when the NDV control group showed the 
appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE), the CEF viability 
was measured using the MTT assay [26]. The mean cellular 
A570 values were used as indices of anti-viral activity. Ba-
icalin was considered to have significant anti-viral activity 
when the A570 value of the Chinese crude drug group was 
significantly higher than that of the virus control group was 
[14]. 
The virus inhibitory rate was calculated based on the 
formula [10]: Virus inhibitory rate=(the highest Ā570 value 
of baicalin group −Ā570 value of the virus control group)/ 
(Ā570 value of the cell control group −Ā570 value of the 
virus control group)×100%. 
Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis (FACS): The CEFs 
were inoculated in 6-well culture plates at 37°C in a hu-
mid atmosphere of 5% CO 2 until they were cultured into a 
monolayer. A 100 TCID 50 virus solution was added to the 
CEFs. After incubation for 2 hr at 37°C, the virus solution 
was removed, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and 
the maximal safe concentration of the baicalin solution was 
added (three wells for each concentration). At the same time, 
the NDV control group (virus only) and the cell control 
group (DMEM only) were established. All CEF plates were 
placed in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C for 72 hr until the 
NDV control group had the appearance of CPE. 
Each group was collected by trypsinization, washed 
twice with PBS, resuspended in one time binding buffer at a 
concentration of 1 × 10 6 cells/ml and subjected to Annexin 
V-FITC/PI staining. The samples were analyzed by <rs type="software">FACS</rs> 
and <rs type="software">Cell Quest</rs> Research Software [4]. 
Statistical analysis: Data were expressed as mean± stan-
dard error (SE), and Duncan's multiple range test was used 
to analyze the difference among the Chinese crude drug and 
control groups. Differences between means were considered 
significant at P&lt;0.05. </p>

<p>an ultrasound system (Antares, Siemens, Brazil); longitudinal, 
transverse, and oblique scans of the 5 abdominal regions were 
made. A total volume of 20 mL of liquid from the 5 regions were 
considered positive for seroma, and an ultrasound-guided punc-
ture was performed for drainage of the seroma. 
Preoperative and postoperative digital photographs were taken 
at least one month after the operation and every six months 
thereafter using a Nikon Coolpix P500 digital camera (12.1 Mpx, 
36X optical zoom, Tokyo, Japan). The follow-up period ranged 
from six to twelve months. 
Statistical analysis of the results was performed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">MedCalc</rs> 
software ver. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.6.2.0</rs> (Mariakerke, Belgium). The results are ex-
pressed as mean+standard deviation. Wilcoxon's rank sum test 
was used for comparisons of same-group paired data. A value 
of P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. With small sample sizes 
in groups, only very strong differences between groups can be 
detected. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± standard

statistical software package (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA</rs>). 
One-way analysis of variance or paired Student's t-tests were 
used for comparisons between groups. P&lt;0.05 was considered 
to indicate a statistically significant difference. </p>

<p>mRNAseq libraries for sequencing were generated from 1 to 1.5 
mg of high quality total RNA, as assessed using the Agilent 2100 
Bioanalyzer. RNA was purified using poly-T oligo-attached mag-
netic beads. Libraries were made according to the manufacturer's 
directions for the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, RS-
122-2101). Resulting short fragment libraries were checked for 
quality and quantity using the Bioanalyzer. Equal molar libraries 
were pooled, requantified and sequenced as 100 bp paired read 
on the Illumina HiSeq, 2000 instrument using <rs id="software-9" type="software">HiSeq Control</rs> 
Software <rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">1.5.15</rs>. Following sequencing, Illumina Primary Analy-
sis version RTA 1.13.48 and <rs id="software-11" type="software">Secondary Analysis</rs> <rs corresp="#software-11" type="version-number">version CASAVA-1.8.2</rs> were run to demultiplex reads for all libraries and 
generate FASTQ files. </p>

<p>To create a reference for expression analysis, paired end sequence 
files from all P. flava experimental time points were pooled 
(605,821,125 pairs totaling 122,164,225,000 bp) and assembled 
using Trinity, <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">version r2013-02-25</rs>, (Grabherr et al., 2011), with 
default parameters. We vector clipped and contaminate filtered 
the resulting assembly with <rs id="software-13" type="software">SeqClean</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-13" type="version-number">version 2011-02-22</rs>, (Seq-
Clean, 2011). The resulting transcriptome reference contained 
527,715 sequences, with an average length of 1,022, and N50 of 
1,961, 208,773 of these sequences contain an ORF of at least 60 
amino acids. All sequences were used for expression analysis 
with sequences from the same Trinity "component," roughly 
equal to a gene, treated as a single gene. 
To maximize the utility of this transcriptome assembly, 
sequences were annotated with the best BLASTx (Camacho et al., 
2008) hit to Swissprot (UniProt, 2015) and NCBI's NR database, 
using an e-value cutoff of 0.001. We also identified PFAM (Finn 
et al., 2014) domains present in P. flava transcripts using 
<rs id="software-14" type="software">hmmscan</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-14" type="version-number">version 3.1b1</rs>, from the <rs id="software-15" type="software">HMMER package</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-15" type="creator">Eddy</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-15" type="version-date">2011</rs>) 
with an e-value cutoff of 0.01. In addition, we annotated these 
transcripts with tmhmm, version 2.0c, (Krogh et al., 2001) <rs id="software-17" type="software">signalP</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-number">version 4.1</rs> (Petersen et al., <rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-date">2011</rs>), and <rs id="software-18" type="software">ncoils</rs> (Lupas et al., <rs corresp="#software-18" type="version-date">1991</rs>). 
We identified putative transcription factors based on PFAM 
domain hits using a list from transcriptionfactor.org. For tran-
scripts with multiple isoforms, annotations were collapsed to the 
gene level as determined by Trinity. </p>

<p>To identify differentially expressed genes, single end reads from 
each time point were aligned to the transcriptome using Bowtie2 
(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with default parameters. Align-
ments were quantified using Samtools (Li et al., 2009). Isoform 
counts were summed to generate a "per gene" count. Differential 
expression analysis and normalization was performed using the 
R package <rs id="software-19" type="software">DESeq2</rs> (Love et al., <rs corresp="#software-19" type="version-date">2014</rs>). All time points were con-
trasted with the zero hour (0 hr) time point. Data used for the 
gene expression analysis have been deposited in the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE70295. </p>

<p>points, and having a hit to the Swissprot protein database were 
identified. These genes were hierarchically clustered on the dis-
tances of the Pearson correlation of the log2 fold change, using 
the complete linkage method to find similar clusters (Figs. 5 and 
6, 7, 8). Significantly differentially expressed genes (P &lt; 1e-5) 
that had transcription factor domains were clustered on the dis-
tances of the Pearson correlation of the log2 fold change, using 
Ward's minimum variance method to find similar clusters (Fig. 
9). All heatmaps were created using the R package <rs id="software-20" type="software">pheatmap</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-20" type="creator">Kolde</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-20" type="version-date">2013</rs>). </p>

<p>Gene Ontology (GO) (Gene Ontology, 2015) terms were assigned 
to each P. flava gene based upon homologous PFAM domains 
and significant Swissprot hits. These terms were used to impute 
functional categories of differentially expressed genes and calcu-
late categorical enrichment. The GO slim terms used were from 
the generic GO slim terms list available at the Gene Ontology 
Web site. GO term enrichment was performed using the R pack-
age <rs id="software-21" type="software">topGO</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-21" type="creator">Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-21" type="version-date">2010</rs>). To examine higher-
level GO terms, significantly enriched (P &lt; 0.01) GO terms were 
mapped to select higher-level GO terms using GO.db. These select 
GO terms were then mapped to the significantly differentially 
expressed genes (P &lt; 1e-5) (Fig. 10). </p>

<p>less than 0.07, 0.08-0.20, and more than 0.20, as suggested by Pe-
schaud et al. [20], but the survival rates of the groups with LNR of 
0.08-0.20 and over 0.20 were not considerably different, so the pa-
tients were finally divided into two groups: One with LNR of less 
than 0.07 and the other with a LNR of 0.07 or greater. 
The statistical analysis was conducted with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">12.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA), and the survival curve was prepared us-
ing a Kaplan-Meier analysis. The univariate analysis and the mul-
tivariate analysis of prognostic factors were performed using the 
log-rank method and the Cox proportional hazard ratio, respec-
tively. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically 
significant. </p>

<p>ABSTRACT. The prevalence of Yersinia enterocolitica (Y. enterocolitica) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was examined in 151 pet animals in-
cluding 108 rodents, 39 rabbits and four sugar gliders from 13 pet stores in the Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. Y. enterocolitica serogroup O:3 
biotype 3 negative for the Voges-Proskauer reaction (O:3/3 variant VP-) was isolated from five Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) 
raised at the same pet store. These pathogenic Y. enterocolitica isolates carried the virulence genes, yadA, ail and virF, and were shown to 
be clonal by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with NotI digestion. This is a first report of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica O:3/3 variant VP-in 
pet Djungarian hamsters in Japan.

<p>are statistically expressed in terms of means and standard 
deviation. Analysis of variance was used for analysis of 
quantitative values, and the Bonferroni post hoc test was used 
for comparisons among groups. Differences were considered 
significant at P,0.05. The Prism software package (ver-
sion 5.02; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad Software Inc</rs>, La Jolla, CA, USA) was 
used to perform the statistical tests. </p>

<p>We used <rs type="software">Stata</rs> syntax (freely available on request) to generate Ofcom 
Scores for each food in the database, and adjusted the scores to fall on a 
scale from 1 to 100 where 1 is the least healthy and 100 is the most 
healthy. 
Second, we chose the NVS, which was developed to inform food 
assistance programmes for populations who are at high risk of under-
nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. The NVSs are based on quantities 
of energy, protein, fat and eight micronutrients measured per 100 g (or 
relevant, food basket-specific quantity) of food to evaluate the relative 
nutritional quality of foods. We calculated the scores for each food in the 
database using an Excel file (freely available on request). 
We ran pair-wise non-parametric Mann-Whitney U comparisons for the 
scores (both Ofcom and NVS) of each category of food, using <rs type="software">Stata</rs> 
software. We applied the Bonferroni adjustment to determine the 
appropriate P-value indicating the significance of our results. Since we 
ran 132 pair-wise comparisons for 12 categories of food, the original 
P-value of 0.05 was reduced to 0.000378, and only the comparisons with 
P-values lower than this were considered as significant. </p>

<p>cells were stained with 18 μL of anti-CD203c-PE and 
CD63-FITC antibodies (Beckman Coulter, Paris, 
France) and incubated for 25 min at 4°C. Following 
lysis of red blood cells (RBCs) with 2 mL cold isotonic 
solution (154 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3 supple-
mented with 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2), samples were 
centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C; cells were then 
washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 
before being resuspended in 300 μL of cold PBS and 
subsequently analyzed. The surface expression of 
CD203c and CD63 on basophils was analyzed by 
flow cytometry (Navios, Beckman Coulter, Hialeah, 
FL, USA). Basophils were gated according to their 
granularity on side scatter and expression of CD203c 
(Fig. 1a). The percentage of CD63-positive cells 
within the total basophil population was calculated as 
shown in Fig. 1b. Data were analyzed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Kaluza 
analysis software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Beckman Coulter</rs>). 
After the optimal concentrations of fMLP and 
anti-FcεRI antibody were found, the same procedure 
was applied on the rest of the samples after incuba-
tion of 100 μL of whole blood with RPMI medium (as 
negative control), RPMI medium containing fMLP at 
a concentration of 5 × 10 
−5 M, and anti-FcεRI anti-
body at a concentration of 3 μg/mL in separate tubes. </p>

<p>Flow cytometric analysis of surface CD11b, active 
CD11b, and CD88 expression on neutrophils 
Whole blood was drawn into EDTA tubes 
(Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson) before and after the 
hemodialysis procedure with high-and low-flux 
dialyzers, respectively. Blood (150 μL) was distrib-
uted in polystyrene tubes and mixed with 2 mL cold 
isotonic solution to lyse the erythrocytes. After 
5 min, the tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g 
at 4°C, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells 
were washed with PBS. The tubes were divided into 
three groups: the unstimulated cells, the cells stimu-
lated with increased temperature (+37°C), and the 
cells stimulated with IL-8 (CXCL8) (Research &amp; 
Diagnostics Systems, Abingdon, UK). RPMI 1640 
medium (200 μL) mixed with 10% fetal calf serum 
was added to all the tubes. IL-8-stimulated cells were 
stimulated with a final concentration of 100 ng/mL 
IL-8 (22). The unstimulated cells were incubated on 
ice, while the stimulated cells were incubated at 37°C 
for 30 min. The tubes were washed with PBS, 
and cells were resuspended in 100 μL of cold PBS. 
Antibodies were added to the relevant tubes-anti-
CD11b-FITC (Beckman Coulter; 20 μL) and anti-
CD11b-PE (activated form, clone CBRM1/5, 
BioLegend Inc., San Diego, CA, USA; 20 μL), as 
well as corresponding isotype controls (IgG1). The 
tubes were incubated for 30 min at 4°C. The cells 
were washed with PBS, resuspended in 350 μL of 
cold PBS, and subsequently analyzed. Data acquisi-
tion was conducted by flow cytometer, and data were 
analyzed using the <rs type="software">Kaluza analysis software</rs>. 
Neutrophils were gated according to their size and 
granularity on forward and side scatter as shown in 
Fig. 1c. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 
CD11b 
+ cells and percentage of active-CD11b 
+ cells 
were measured within region G, according to the 
gates set by the respective isotype controls. For 
detection of CD88 expression, 150 μL of blood was 
added to polystyrene tubes, RBCs were lysed, and 
cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 100 μL 
of PBS, and incubated with 20 μL anti-CD88 anti-</p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Scatter plots were prepared using <rs id="software-2" type="software">GraphPad 
Prism 5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA</rs>), 
representing the range with whiskers and the median 
as a middle line. Statistical analysis was done in 
<rs type="software">GraphPad Prism 5</rs>. As the study population was 
not normally distributed, comparison between the 
groups was performed by the nonparametric 
Kruskal-Wallis test. Significant differences between 
groups were analyzed using the post hoc Wilcoxon 
matched-pairs signed-rank test. A P value of &lt;0.05 
was considered significant. </p>

<p>Using <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> software, Chi-square was performed to com-
pare the groups. </p>

<p>sizes calculated (h 2 ). Partial correlations (r and eta) controlling for 
smoking status were used to assess associations within student status 
and to compare associations across student status. Across-group com-
parisons of associations were tested using Fischer's r-to-z transforma-
tion. Data were weighted for comparison of student and non-student 
groups. All analyses were conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">13</rs>. </p>

<p>Sample size 
As this was the first study of respiratory health status of 
coal-based sponge iron plant workers, no information 
was available on which to base the sample size calcula-
tion. Instead, a web-based sample size calculator, 
<rs type="software">Creative Research Systems</rs>, 
16 was used to calculate the 
sample size, using the following assumptions/informa-
tion: confidence level (95%), margin of error (5%) and 
population size (total 662 coal-based sponge iron plant 
workers, this information was received from the factory 
directors in Barjora). A random sample of 258 such 
workers was required, assuming a response rate of 95%. 
A numbered list of all 662 workers was created (worker 
1, worker 2, worker 3 and so forth). A web-based rando-
miser, <rs type="software">Research Randomizer</rs>, 
17 was used to generate 1 </p>

<p>Electrical test system. A PXI bus test system was constructed to provide high stable 
powers for the sensors and to precisely measure the collecting currents from pA to nA. 
The test system based on PXI bus was consisted of a 14-Slot Chassis (NI PXI-1044), a 
controller module (NI PXI-ExpressCard8360), five digital multimeter modules (NI 
PXI-4071), and three power modules (NI PXI-4132). The three power modules 
provided voltages needed for the electrodes (Fig. 1c). Two of the power modules were 
connected in series to provide 0-150 V voltage for extracting electrodes of the 
sensors, and the other power module provided 0-100 V voltage for collecting 
electrodes. The digital multimeter modules with shielded cables are capable of 
acquiring the collecting currents from pA to nA for five sensors at the same time. All 
acquired data were recorded to a computer through a <rs type="software">LabVIEW</rs> program linked to 
MXI interface. </p>

simulator' implemented for <rs type="software">STATA</rs> by Cappellari and Jenkins (2003). 
6 As a robustness check we have also performed for each country 12 separate Probit regressions 
one for each type of linkage. Results in terms of sign and significance of the estimators of 
multivariate and binary Probit are very similar. These results are available upon request from

<p>Subjects 
The cine MRI images used in this study were selected 
from records obtained to evaluate deglutitive tongue 
move ments in patients with open bite and Class II maloc-
clusions. 
18,19 This study was initiated after obtaining 
institutional approval from Gulhane Military Medical 
Academy's Ethics Committee (1491-373-07). Images of 
36 patients with normal overjet (1 -3 mm) were selected. 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">G*Power</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">v3.1.3</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Franz Faul</rs>, Universitat Kiel, 
Germany) was used to determine the power of the sample 
size. 
20 A sample size of 36 patients was considered suf-
ficient to provide more than 60% power for detecting 
significant differences with an effect size of 0.30 between 
groups at a 0.05 significance level. 
Two groups were formed according to the presence of 
anterior open bite (at least −2 mm). The open bite group 
(OBG) included 18 patients (14 girls and 4 boys) with a 
mean age of 14.5 ± 2.7 years and mean overbite of −4.9 ± 
1.9 mm. The control group (CG) comprised 18 patients (11 
girls and 7 boys) with a mean age of 16.4 ± 0.9 years and 
mean overbite of 1.9 ± 0.7 mm. Cephalometric analyses </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed with <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> for 
Windows (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 15</rs>, IBM <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, </p>

<p>Chemical structures were retrieved either from PubChem (https:// 
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed in March 2012) or ChemSpider (http:// 
www.chemspider.com/, accessed in March 2012) databases using chemical names. 
Chemicals were removed if their structures could not be found. Each dataset was carefully 
curated according to previously established guidelines (Fourches et al., 2010). Briefly, 
counterions were removed, whereas specific chemotypes such as aromatic and nitro groups 
were normalized using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">ChemAxon Standardizer</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v.5.3</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">ChemAxon Budapest, Hungary</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://www.chemaxon.com</rs>). The presence of duplicates, i.e., identical compounds reported 
more than once in the same dataset, is known to lead to over-optimistic estimations of the 
predictivity for developed QSAR models. However, the analysis of such records also gives 
an estimate of the dataset quality: if activity data for the same compound are consistent, the 
overall data quality is high; if there is a large deviation in experimental values between 
different records of the same compound, the quality is, obviously, low. Thus, after the 
structural standardization, the duplicates were identified using <rs type="software">ISIDA Duplicates</rs> (Varnek et 
al., 2008) and <rs type="software">HiT QSAR</rs> (Kuz'min et al., 2008) software and carefully analyzed. If the 
experimental properties associated with two duplicative structures were identical, or highly 
similar, then one compound was chosen at random and deleted. However, if their 
experimental properties were significantly different, we deleted both records from the 
dataset. During the curation of human skin permeability dataset, we found 17 pairs of 
duplicate structures and two sets of triplicates as shown in Table S3. The permeability 
values for duplicative records were almost identical (logKp variation ~ 0.01 LU) except 
those for butanoic acid that had a variation higher than ca. 0.4 LU. Thus, the LogKp value 
for all 17 compounds was averaged and the duplicative records were removed so that only 
one permeability coefficient was used for a chemical compound. </p>

<p>Hierarchical Cluster Analysis-The clustering of a chemical dataset consists of 
merging compounds into distinct clusters of chemically similar molecules [see (Downs and 
Barnard, 2003; Mercier, 2003) for a review of the most popular clustering approaches used 
in computational chemistry]. In this study, we have employed the Sequential Agglomerative 
Hierarchical Non-overlapping (SAHN) method implemented in the <rs id="software-3" type="software">ISIDA/Cluster</rs> program 
(<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr.</rs>) (Varnek et al., 2007). Briefly, each compound represents one 
cluster at the start. Then, the m compounds are merged iteratively into clusters using their 
pairwise Euclidean distances stored in a squared (m * m) symmetric distance matrix. The 
two closest objects (molecules or clusters) are iteratively identified and merged to form a 
new cluster, the distance matrix being updated with the re-computed distances separating the 
newly formed cluster and the others, according to the user-specified type of linkage </p>

<p>(complete linkage in this study). The process is repeated until one cluster remains. The 
parent-child relationships between clusters result in a hierarchical data representation, or 
dendrogram. In particular, we used <rs type="software">ISIDA/Cluster</rs> to obtain the heat map (see Results 
section) of the proximity matrix. </p>

<p>Dragon Descriptors-The following types of descriptors were generated using <rs id="software-5" type="software">Dragon 
software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">v.5.5.</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Talete SRL, Milan, Italy</rs>): 0D constitutional (atom and group counts), 1D 
functional groups, 1D atom-centered fragments, 2D topological descriptors, 2D walk and 
path counts, 2D autocorrelations, 2D connectivity indices, 2D information indices, 2D 
topological charge indices, 2D eigenvalue-based indices, 2D topological descriptors, 2D 
edge-adjacency indices, 2D Burden eigenvalues, 2D binary fingerprints, 2D frequency 
fingerprints, and molecular properties. The detailed discussion for these descriptors can be 
found elsewhere (Todeschini and Consonni, 2000). </p>

<p>SiRMS Descriptors-2D Simplex Representation of Molecular Structure (SiRMS) 
descriptors (Muratov et al., 2010) (representing numbers of unique tetratomic fragments 
with fixed composition and topological structure) were generated by the <rs type="software">HiT QSAR</rs> 
software (Kuz'min et al., 2008). At the 2D level, the connectivity of atoms in a simplex, 
atom type, and bond nature (single, double, triple, or aromatic) have been considered. 
SiRMS descriptors account not only for the atom type, but also for other atomic 
characteristics that may impact biological activity of molecules, e.g., partial charge, 
lipophilicity, refraction, and an atom ability for being a donor/acceptor in hydrogen-bond 
formation (H-bond). For atom characteristics with continuous values (charge, lipophilicity, 
and refraction) the division of the entire value range into definite discrete groups has been 
carried out. The atoms have been divided into four groups corresponding to their (i) partial 
charge A≤−0.05&lt;B≤0&lt;C≤0.05&lt;D, (ii) lipophilicity A≤−0.5&lt;B≤0&lt;C≤0.5&lt;D, and (iii) 
refraction A≤1.5&lt;B≤3&lt;C≤8&lt;D. For H-bond characteristic, the atoms have been divided into 
three groups: A (acceptor of hydrogen in H-bond), D (donor of hydrogen in H-bond), and I 
(indifferent atom). The usage of sundry variants of differentiation of simplex vertexes 
(atoms) represents the principal feature of the SiRMS approach (Kuz'min et al., 2007). 
Detailed description of <rs type="software">HiT QSAR</rs> and SiRMS can be found elsewhere (Kuz'min et al., 
2008; Muratov et al., 2010). </p>

<p>Random Forest-Random Forest models were constructed according to the original RF 
algorithm (Breiman, 2001) using the <rs id="software-8" type="software">CF software</rs> <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">version 2.12</rs> (Polishchuk et al., 2009). RF 
is an ensemble of single decision trees. Outputs of all trees are aggregated to obtain one final 
prediction. Each tree is grown as follows: (i) a bootstrap sample is produced from the whole 
set of N compounds to form a training set for the current tree. Compounds that are not in the 
training set of the current tree are placed in the out-of-bag (OOB) set (size of ~ N/3); (ii) the 
best split by CART algorithm (Breiman et al., 1984) among the m randomly selected 
descriptors from the entire pool in each node is chosen; (iii) each tree is then grown to the 
largest possible extent; there is no pruning. The predicted classification values are defined 
by majority voting for one of the classes. Thus, each tree predicts values for only those 
compounds that are not included in the training set of that tree (for OOB set only). Since RF 
possesses its own reliable statistical characteristics (based on OOB set prediction) which 
could be used for validation and model selection, no cross-validation was performed 
(Breiman, 2001). Thus, the final model is chosen by the lowest error for prediction of the 
OOB set. The local (tree) applicability domain approach (Artemenko et al., 2011) was used 
for all RF models developed in this study. </p>

<p>DERMWIN-The <rs id="software-9" type="software">Dermal Permeability Coefficient Program (DERMWIN</rs>) is a module 
available in the EPI Suite package developed by the <rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention Toxics and Syracuse Research Corporation.</rs> and available at <rs corresp="#software-9" type="url">http://www.epa.gov/oppt/ exposure/pubs/episuitedl.htm.</rs>. The <rs id="software-10" type="software">DERMWIN</rs> <rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">v.2.02</rs> estimates chemicals' dermal 
permeability coefficient using the following equation 1 (USEPA, 2004): </p>

<p>where K o/w is the octanol/water partition coefficient and MW is the molecular weight of the 
chemical. Human skin permeability dataset (dataset D) was imported to <rs type="software">DERMWIN</rs> as 
SMILES strings, and logKp was calculated and compared to the predictions of our models. </p>

<p>The <rs id="software-12" type="software">DERMWIN</rs> module available as part of the <rs corresp="#software-12" type="creator">EPI suite software</rs> has been employed in 
several recent studies (Fong and Tong, 2012; Fong et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013) for 
evaluating skin permeability. For this reason, we decided to compare our models with that 
implemented in this software. <rs type="software">DERMWIN</rs> uses a linear equation that relates the 
permeability coefficient with the chemical's octanol/water partition coefficient and 
molecular weight. However, statistical characteristics of this model suggested that this 
correlation was not adequate to predict human permeability. Although our consensus model 
12 had a lower coverage of chemical space than <rs type="software">DERMWIN</rs> (77% vs. 100%), it 
significantly outperformed DERMWIN in predictivity (Q 2 ext = 72% vs. 43%, respectively) 
(see Table 1). When the AD restriction was removed and the predictive accuracy of the 
models was evaluated using the same set of compounds (143 compounds), the comparison 
was in favor of our model (Q 2 ext = 71% vs. 66%, respectively) (see Table 3). </p>

<p>We have built statistically significant and externally predictive QSAR models of skin 
permeability that can be used to predict the permeability of untested compounds through the 
skin. Comparison of the developed consensus model with <rs type="software">DERMWIN</rs> software showed that 
our model significantly outperformed DERMWIN in predictivity (Q 2 ext = 72% and 43%, 
respectively) but at the expense of some lost in coverage (77% vs. 100%); when applied to 
the same set of compounds as used for DERMWIN (ignoring the AD for our models) the 
performance of our model is still higher (Q 2 ext = 71% vs. 66%). The compiled datasets and 
all the models developed in this study have been made publicly available at the Chembench 
Web Portal (http://chembench.mml.unc.edu). </p>

<p>estimation [14]. Data (mean, CIs) are presented 
below for interest even though the study was not 
powered to detect an effect of the intervention. 
Questionnaire feasibility was determined via partici-
pant acceptability, mean duration for completion 
(minutes), and standardised response means (SRM), 
a measure of the sensitivity of each questionnaire to 
detect change. SRM was calculated as mean change 
in scores or values divided by the standard deviation 
in change scores [15]. The SRM provides the relative 
magnitude of mean change compared with the var-
iability of change, with higher SRM values indicat-
ing greater sensitivity. BMI and waist circumference 
measurements were converted to SDSs using UK 
1990 growth references [16]. For selection of a pri-
mary outcome for the multi-centre trial (based on 
the ability of BMI, waist circumference, and BIA to 
predict DXA), multiple linear regression modelling 
was used, starting with a full model and using back-
wards selection, to identify which variables were 
predictors of DXA fat mass after adjusting for age 
and gender. Model assumptions were checked (nor-
mally distributed residuals and constant variance) 
and, when necessary, variables were log transformed 
to improve model fit. The models that best predicted 
baseline DXA (those with the most significant pre-
dictors and the highest R 2 value) were then applied 
separately to the 6-and 12-month DXA results in 
order to see how well the models predicted fat mass.

<p>Forty patients admitted to our clinic between January 
and December 2011, who underwent liver biopsy with a di-
agnosis of CHB, were included in this cross-sectional study. 
The inclusion criterion was age over 18 years. The exclu-
sion criteria were co-infection with hepatitis C virus or 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), alcohol abuse (40 
g/day for men and 20 g/day for women), biopsy-proven 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or any immunological liver 
disease. The decision to perform liver biopsy was based on 
the EASL HBV guidelines (3). Approval for the study was 
granted by the local clinical research ethics committee, 
and informed consent was obtained from each patient. 
The baseline characteristics of the patients and their 
laboratory results, including alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), platelet count, 
and HBV DNA, were collected from the computerized hos-
pital database. Blood samples were obtained from the pa-
tients after informed consent on the same day as the liver 
biopsy, and were stored at -80°C until the procedure was 
completed. M30 values were measured using an M30 ELISA 
kit (Peviva; Bromma, Sweden) according to the manufac-
turer's recommendations. 
The severity of fibrosis was assessed as mild (F0 and F1), 
moderate (F2 and F3), or advanced (F4 and F5), and the his-
tological activity index (HAI) was classified as mild (1 -5), 
moderate (6 -8), or severe (9 -12). 
Forty healthy controls were also included in the study 
for comparison with the patient group's laboratory param-
eters, including M30, ALT, AST, and platelet count. All of the 
controls completed a questionnaire to determine whether 
they had any chronic illness that could affect the results, 
and digital data from our hospital were used to evaluate 
the presence of chronic hepatitis and possible etiologic fac-
tors, such as viral hepatitis or HIV.

<p>therapist recruited from the hospital, 7 were in their first year of clinical experience, 8 in their second year and 6 in their third 
year. Their training institution, university or vocational school, was not taken into account. Overall in our study group, the 
lapse of time from learning of basic techniques of ROM measurement ranged between 1 year, for second year students, to 
6 years, for physical therapists in their third year of clinical practice. All participants performed ROM measurements on the 
same volunteer, a healthy young male with no past history of orthopedic disorders of his right knee. 
The methods and procedures for our study were approved by the Mejiro University Institutional Review Board (approval 
number: 15-013). All participants, and the volunteer, received a full explanation of the study and provided their informed 
consent. 
Prior to conducting the full study, we completed a pilot study to confirm the accuracy of knee ROM measurements 
obtained using an electrogoniometer (SG150, Biometrics Ltd., UK), which was used as the criterion value for the evaluation 
of the measurement error of the universal goniometer. A standardized procedure was used to position the electrogoniometer 
for the recording of knee joint ROM positions. The electrogoniometer was attached to the right leg using double-sided 
tape, with the knee flexed to 60°. The proximal point of attachment was localized 1 cm from the lateral epicondyle of the 
femur, along a line connecting the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur. The distal point of attachment 
was localized 1 cm from the head of the fibula, along a line connecting the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus. The 
bony landmarks used as a reference for the localization of the electrogoniometer were identified by palpation and marked. 
A thin string was attached with tape between both pairs of landmarks (i.e., greater trochanter and lateral epicondyle of the 
femur; head of the fibula and lateral malleolus). The thin string was used as a guide to attach the electrogoniometer. Once 
the electrogoniometer was placed and secured, an elastic wrap was used to prevent slipping of the electrogoniometer during 
measurements, as well as to hide its position from the participants performing measurements using a universal goniometer. 
Reflective markers were then placed over the bony landmarks, namely the greater trochanter, lateral epicondyle of the femur, 
head of the fibula, and lateral malleolus to visualize their positions on digital images captured obtained by a two-camera 
system (B-CAM, DKH, Japan). Passive knee ROM was measured by one experimenter, from full extension to maximum 
flexion, with the experimenter taking care to maintain the knee motion in the sagittal plane, avoiding adduction/abduction and 
internal/external rotation motions of the hip as much as possible. The measurement was recorded by the two-camera system 
with the signals between the cameras and the electrogoniometer synchronized using a trigger switch. The knee joint position 
data obtained from the electrogoniometer and the imaging data captured by the cameras were analyzed using a motion analy-
sis system (Frame-DIAS V, DKH, Japan). For the imaging data, the knee joint angle was defined as the angle formed by the 
line connecting the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle and the line connecting the head of the fibula and the lateral 
malleolus. Agreement between the imaging and electrogoniometer data was evaluated by simple linear regression, using 
the imaging data as the dependent variable and the electrogoniometer data as the independent variable. The level of agree-
ment between the electrogoniometer and imaging data was high at knee flexion angles of 20° to 90° (y=0.960x, R 2 =0.998, 
p&lt;0.001). Therefore, we used this range of knee motion for the main experiment. Statistical analyses were performed with 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM</rs> <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS Statistics</rs> software (ver. <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">23</rs>). 
For the main experiment, each participant performed two consecutive measurements of passive knee flexion ROM, and 
the limb was returned to its original position between measurements. For all measurements, the electrogoniometer was 
attached by one experimenter, using the standardized procedures, with its position hidden from participants by the elastic 
wrap. The electrogoniometer was connected to a data logger (PH-7010, DKH, Japan), providing a real time display of 
measurements to the experimenter, with signals saved at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz for off-line analysis. Audio feed-
back of threshold knee positions of 60° and 75° was provided to the volunteer through stereo earphones. An audio signal 
was provided when knee ROM exceeded 60° and disappeared when the ROM exceeded 75°. The volunteer used the audio 
feedback to simulate knee flexion restrictions. On the first measurement trial, upon hearing the audio feedback (i.e., 60° of 
knee flexion), the volunteer would say that 'the knee will not bend any further" and resist the force being applied to flex the 
knee by the participant. In the second measurement trial, the volunteer would say the same and resist motion at the cessation 
of the audio feedback (i.e., 75° of knee flexion). These scenarios were used to simulate a pre-to post-intervention change in 
ROM, as might be found in practice. 
All measurements were performed using a metal universal goniometer. This goniometer had a handle 30 cm in length 
and angle marks with 1° increments. The measurement landmarks were the greater trochanter, the lateral epicondyle of the 
femur, the head of the fibula, and the lateral malleolus. The angle formed by the line connecting the greater trochanter and 
the lateral epicondyle of the femur and the line connecting the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus was measured by 
the participants in 1° increments. Measurements were performed using participants' usual technique, with no instructions 
provided regarding confirmation of localization of landmarks by palpation, the technique for passively flexing the knee, or 
the method used to position the goniometer on the leg. As soon as the participants completed their measurement, they were 
instructed to announce "done" and to report the measurement to the experimenter. The experimenter marked the end of the 
trial using an external 'event' trigger (IS3, DKH, Japan) input into the data logger. This event marker was used to synchronize 
the signal from the electrogoniometer with the end-position measured using the universal goniometer. The angle provided 
by the electrogoniometer was used as the criterion reference value, with the measurement error of the universal goniometer 
quantified as the difference between the measure stated by the participant and the reference value recorded using the elect-
rogoniometer. The time required to complete the measurement was the time from the start of the trial, including palpation of </p>

<p>bony landmarks, to the time when the participant announced "done". 
The following variables were used in the analysis: level of proficiency, defined as the number of years since receiving 
basic instruction in goniometry measurement; measurement error; and measurement time. The means and standard deviations 
(SD) of the measurement error and measurement time were calculated for the proficiency level (1-6 years). Reproducibility 
of the end-point of knee ROM by the volunteer was evaluated for the first (60°) and second (75°) trials by calculating the 
mean and SD of the values recorded by the electrogoniometer. The absolute measurement error was calculated as the differ-
ence between the ROM measure of the electrogoniometer and the measure reported by the participants. The mean, SD and 
95% confidence interval (CI) of the absolute error was calculated for each proficiency level. Split-plot analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of proficiency level on the absolute measurement error and measurement time as 
dependent variables. A Bland-Altman analysis was performed to evaluate the presence or absence of systematic bias in the 
ROM measurements obtained using a universal goniometer. The differences between the measurements obtained with the 
electrogoniometer and the universal goniometer were plotted along the y-axis, with the mean of both measurements plotted 
along the x-axis. The mean difference (md), SD of the md (SD dif ), and 95% CI of the md were calculated to identify systematic 
(fixed) errors. A simple linear regression analysis was performed to identify possible proportional bias. The magnitude of the 
random error in measurement was evaluated by calculating the MDC at the 95% CI level (MDC 95 ) as follows: MDC 95 =1.96 
SD dif . All statistical analyses were performed using <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">IBM</rs> <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS Statistics</rs> software (ver. <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">23</rs>). </p>

<p>Medical records and multimodal imaging, including color 
fundus photography (CFP), red-free photography (RF), fundus 
autofluorescence (FAF), near-infrared reflectance scanning 
laser ophthalmoscopy (NIR), and SD-OCT was performed on 
all the patients. CFP and RF were performed with a TRC-50IX 
flood-illuminated fundus camera (Topcon Medical Systems, 
Oakland, NJ, USA). FAF was performed with either the 
Spectralis HRA þ OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, 
Germany) or the Topcon TRC-50IX fundus camera. SD-OCT 
imaging with corresponding NIR images was performed on the 
<rs type="software">Spectralis</rs>. OCT scans taken before the acquisition of eye-
tracked Spectralis scans were assessed qualitatively but not 
included in the quantitative analysis. The SD-OCT protocol 
used in all eyes comprised 208 horizontal raster line scans over 
the area of interest, ranging from 19 to 49 B-scans per eye, with 
each scan spaced 115 to 250 lm apart, and automatic real-time 
averaging set between 4 and 23. 
To study the origin and progression of plateaus, the most 
recent SD-OCT with this signature was identified. Then, serial 
eye-tracked B-scans of the region of interest were tracked back 
to baseline. In cases in which the scanning protocol varied 
during the course of follow-up, the B-scan closest to the area of 
interest was matched manually and extracted for analysis. 
These extracted SD-OCT images were then stacked, aligned, 
and saved as a video file using the Fiji distribution (''Fiji is just 
Image J,'' http://fiji.sc; in the public domain) 22 for the 
qualitative analysis of the progression of the lesion (see 
Supplementary Video). At each time point, the plateau 
appearance on SD-OCT was correlated to the appearance in 
CFP, NIR, and FAF. 
Three patients had en face OCT and OCT angiography 
(OCTA) imaging with 3 3 3-mm macular cubes (RTVue XR 
''Avanti''; Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA). The review software 
(ReVUe, Version 2015.1.0.90; Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA) 
displays flow signals superimposed in red on a cross-sectional 
structural SD-OCT image. </p>

<p>A 308 3 208 SD-OCT volume (143 scans, 30-lm spacing, 
automated real-time averaging [ART] ¼ 25) was captured along 
with red-free and near-infrared reflectance scanning laser 
ophthalmoscopic images. Tissue punches were postfixed by 
osmium tannic acid paraphenylenediamine to accentuate 
extracellular lipid and embedded in epoxy resin (PolyBed 
812; Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). 28 Sub-micrometer-
thick (0.8 lm) sections at 25-to 30-lm intervals were stained 
with 1% toluidine blue for polychromaticity, scanned with a 
340 objective, and reviewed and photodocumented with a 360 
oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture ¼ 1.4) and digital 
camera (XC10; Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA). Images were 
adjusted for exposure, contrast, and sharpness (<rs id="software-3" type="software">Photoshop

USA) software. Unpaired t-test was used to compare clinical 
data and questionnaire outcomes between patients who had 
met their surgeon on DOS and PDOS. Chi-square test was 
used to compare percentages. 
Multivariate regression model was developed to find fac-
tors predictive of the outcomes of the Question 4 (Table 1): 
"Do you feel you were properly consented for surgery?" 
Stepwise generalized linear approach to the model creation 
was used, and patient's demographics, clinical parameters 
as well as other questionnaire responses were considered 
as independent variables in the regression model. Standard 
assumptions required for the use of a multivariate regression 
model approach were tested and satisfied. Although differ-
ent data transformations were explored, a linear relationship 
between the dependent and independent variables was deemed 
to be the most appropriate. Normality of all variables was 
tested and confirmed using Q-Q plots. A correlation matrix 
was used to conclude that there was little to no multicol-
linearity and independence was confirmed. An assumption of 
homoscedasticity was determined to be met using a White test 
to measure the homogeneity of variance of the residuals. </p>

<p>Study design, evaluations, and treatment. Before study entry, 
patients were studied with a complete medical history and physical 
exam; complete blood counts and serum chemistry; CA19.9 
tumour marker; high-resolution CT scan of the abdomen, FDG-
PET scan; and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography. 
Treatment consisted of nab-paclitaxel 125 mg m 
-2 followed by 
gemcitabine 1000 mg m 
-2 administered on days 1, 8, and 15, every 
28 days for two cycles. Treatment-related toxicities were evaluated 
by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria of 
Adverse Events version 3.0. A CT scan, FDG-PET, elastography, 
and CA19.9 were used to determine tumour response after two 
cycles of treatment. Objective tumour responses were evaluated 
according to <rs id="software-1" type="software">RECIST</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 1.1</rs> criteria (Eisenhauer et al, 2009). 
EUS elastography was performed with the linear Pentax EUS 
(Montvale, NJ, USA) and the Hitachi EUB900 equipment 
(Tokyo, Japan). Representative areas of the tumour and surround-
ing normal tissues were selected for analysis. The results of the 
elastography evaluation was defined by the quotient strain ratio 
between the normal and tumour regions as previously described 
(Iglesias-Garcia et al, 2010). Patients with stable or responding 
tumours were schedule for surgical resection 6-8 weeks after the last 
chemotherapy dose. The degree of tumour regression in the surgical 
specimen was determined adapting the Ryan's classification utilised 
in rectal cancer including four categories: GRT-0, complete 
response; GRT-1, important partial response with only single cells 
or isolated cell groups left; GRT-2, partial response but large residual 
tumour, and GRT-3 low or no response and large residual cancer 
(Ryan et al, 2005). R1 resection was considered if there were tumour 
cells present p1 mm of the resection margin. Postoperative 
treatment consisted in four cycles of standard dose of gemcitabine. </p>

<p>Tissue assessments. The primary end point of the study was to 
determine the effects of treatment on tumour stroma including 
assessment of collagen content and structure and CAFs. In 
addition to study samples obtained from patients and mouse 
models, we also analysed a set of six samples from patients with 
untreated PDA and six samples from patients treated with 
conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Collagen 
analysis was assessed using collagen I primary rabbit antibody 
(1 : 100; Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) for 
1 h at 37 1C and as secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 donkey 
anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Activated 
fibroblasts were determined with double staining using vimentin, 
as total fibroblasts marker (1 : 50; Cell Signaling Technology, 
Danvers, MA, USA) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as an 
activated fibroblast marker (1 : 100; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, 
Denmark). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 
donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for vimentin and Alexa 
Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for SMA. 
Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and mounted 
with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were 
acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope TCS-SP5 
(AOBS) Leica (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with two 
magnifications Â 20 HCX PL APO CS (0.7 NA) and Â 40 HCX 
PL APO CS (1.25 NA) oil immersion objectives. Acquisition

quantification was performed with <rs type="software">Definiens Developer XD</rs> Software 
(Munich, Germany). Detected cells were classified depending on the 
ratio between mean layer intensities of both, vimentin and SMA. 
Activated fibroblasts were considered when they co-expressed SMA 
and vimentin. We determined the fibroblast density index by 
adjusting the number of cells counted to the proportion of tumour 
fibrosis observed in the specimen (adapted from Erkan et al, 2008). 
The quantification was done in two different and representative 
fields (20 steps) for each sample. In the preclinical study, 
immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against 
mouse SPARC (R&amp;D Systems, MAB942, Minneapolis, MN, USA) 
and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. The analysis was made by 'intention to treat' 
with all patients included using the <rs id="software-4" type="software">IBM SPSS Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">Version 20.0</rs> 
(IBM, Madrid, Spain). Quantitative variables pre-and post-
treatment were compared using ANOVA test, Student's t-test, and 
non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test for two 
related samples. The correlation between the outcome variables was 
tested with the Spearman correlation coefficient. In the preclinical 
study, all values are represented as mean ± s.e.m. Immunohisto-
chemistry quantifications were evaluated for significance using the </p>

<p>The quality of serosurveillance in low-and middle-income 
countries is described in an updated assessment building on 
similar exercises. 
9 Broadly, the quality of serosurveillance has 
remained constant with an increased number of antenatal clinic 
sites and nationally representative population samples, but with 
an increase in the number of countries with poorly functioning 
surveillance. 
A paper from Jamaica explains how the <rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-date">2009</rs> versions of the 
<rs id="software-10" type="software">EPP</rs> and <rs type="software">Spectrum</rs> tools have been applied in Jamaica, together 
with the country-specific data and assumptions, to assess the 
course of the epidemic and to set programme targets. </p>

<p>Looking towards the future, we expect several new develop-
ments in estimation tools. First, it is desirable that <rs type="software">EPP</rs> and 
<rs type="software">Spectrum</rs> be integrated, thereby allowing streamlining of the 
handling of demographic and ART data, and in doing so avoiding 
errors. Second, a more flexible epidemic model should be 
included in <rs type="software">EPP</rs> to improve on the current phi-shift feature, 
building on the proposals by Hogan 
16 and Bao. 
17 Many countries 
now have seen a decline in prevalence and these would be 
expected to show an increase in prevalence in future years as 
a result of either increased survival due to ART of a large 
proportion of all people living with HIV or of increased trans-
mission, or both. Third, with ART programmes expanding and 
maturing, improvements in modelling epidemics should be 
expected from the tracking of HIV-infected individuals by their 
CD4 level. Fourth, for mother-to-child transmission, the new 
WHO guidelines should be incorporated in <rs type="software">Spectrum</rs>. 
While <rs type="software">EPP</rs> and <rs type="software">Spectrum</rs> work well for countries where 
survey-derived data constitute the bulk of the surveillance data, 
they are not well adapted for countries that rely mostly on HIV 
and AIDS case reporting for HIV surveillance. Many European 
countries rely on such data and a new initiative coordinated by 
the European Centre for Disease Control hopes to develop 
estimation tools appropriate in such settings. </p>

<p>A retrospective review was performed of 111 patients with 
a diagnosis of CP/CPPS who were managed at Yonsei 
University Wonju Severance Christian Hospital between 
June 2010 and June 2012. The diagnosis of CP/CPPS was 
made by physical examination, microscopic analysis of 
urine and standard microbiological cultures, transrectal 
ultrasonography, and serum prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) measurements. Patients were included in the study 
if they had experienced pain or discomfort in the pelvic re-
gion for at least 3 months [4]. We excluded patients with 
urinary tract infection, hypoechoic lesions on transrectal 
prostate ultrasound, serum PSA levels greater than or 
equal to 4 ng/dL, a history of antibiotic treatment in the 6 
months preceding the initial visit, invasive prostate-re-
lated procedures (transurethral resection of the prostate, 
transurethral incision of the prostate, or transurethral 
needle ablation), genitourinary cancer, inflammatory bow-
el disease, active urethral stricture, prostate or bladder 
surgery, or neurologic diseases affecting the bladder. 
Depending on the number of WBCs in the EPS or VB3, 
each patient was designated into the 2 NIH subgroups dis-
cussed above. A patient was assigned to the NIH category 
IIIA group if the WBC count in the EPS was equal to or 
greater than 10 per high power field (HPF) or the WBC 
count in the VB3 was equal to or greater than 5 per HPF. 
Conversely, a patient was assigned to IIIB if the WBC count 
in the EPS was less than 10 per HPF or the WBC count in 
the VB3 was less than 5 per HPF [2]. Both groups were eval-
uated before the treatment and 6 weeks after the treatment 
by using NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index 
(NIH-CPSI) scores and the International Prostate Symp-
tom Score (IPSS). Determination of the presence or ab-
sence of the therapeutic effect was defined as when the 
CPSI score fell 6 points or more [5]. All the patients were 
treated with once-daily alpha-blockers (alfuzosin 10 g) and 
quinolone (levofloxacin 500 mg) for 6 weeks. 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">PASW</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 18.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA) was used 
for all statistical analyses. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
was used to compare the baseline scores with posttreat-
ment scores. Paired t-test and chi-square test were used to 
analyze the efficacy of treatment between groups. Trea-
tment outcome was analyzed by logistic regression, ad-
justed for age, prostate volume, IPSS, and category of 
CP/CPPS. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered stat-
istically significant. </p>

<p>We perform in silico data construction to simulate a zero-
charge, native MS spectrum based on the masses and relative 
abundances of glycans identified using targeted glycan profil-
ing, the basic principle of which has been described previ-
ously. 
35 The data construction is achieved based on the 
following 3 elements: 1) the mass of the mAb backbone; 2) the 
masses and relative abundance of the glycans identified by tar-
geted glycan profiling; and 3) extra modifications on mAb 
backbone.

<p>Sufficient explanation of this study's intent and the overall purpose was given, and voluntary consent to participate in this 
study was obtained from all of the subjects. Information on the study and written informed consent according to the ethical 
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki were provided to all subjects prior to their participation. 
The trials consisted of underwater and overground walking training. The subjects either walked on an underwater tread-
mill (HydroTrack ® Underwater Treadmill System, Conray, Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA) or walked on an overground treadmill 
(HL-1100, Healthlife, Korea). The water temperature was set at about 33 °C and the depth was fixed to reach up between the 
subjects' xiphoid process and the navel. The speed of the treadmill was limited to a maximum velocity of 2-4 m/s in both 
groups 4) . The both group consisted of 30-minute walking sessions, five times per week for four weeks. 
After the intervention, balance measuring equipment (Good Balance, Metitur, Finland) was used to quantitatively measure 
each subject's balance ability 5) . The balance test was performed by a physical therapist who had completed the course for the 
balance test method and was experienced in clinical practice for over three years. To measure balance function, the subject 
was instructed to stand on a triangle platform and maintain a symmetrical posture with the feet shoulder width apart. A visual 
fixed point was located in front of the subject to minimize head movements. The subject's arms were placed comfortably 
at the hip joints and the center of pressure (COP) was measured for 30 seconds in the standing posture with the eyes open. 
COP was measured three times and average values were calculated. The software also calculates several variables describing 
the quantitative aspects of individual's test behaviour, e.g. amount and speed of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway, 
amplitude of sway, the first moment of sway velocity (combined amplitude and velocity of the movement of the center of 
pressure), power spectrum analysis (<rs type="software">FFT analysis</rs>) etc. Low score of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway implies 
excellent balance ability. The index of balance function score ranges between 0 and 100, and a higher score implies greater 
balance ability to perform the task. A reliable and valid measurement of the functioning of posture control mechanisms is a 
prerequisite for discovering the reasons for balance problems or evaluating the effects of treatment and rehabilitation. 
The mean and SD were calculated for each variable. Before the intervention, differences in the general characteristics 
of the experimental group were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Variables were compared before and after training within 
experimental group using paired sample t-tests. The statistical analysis was conducted using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">20.0</rs> (SPSS, Chicago, IL, 
USA), and statistical significance was accepted for p values &lt;0.05 </p>

<p>. When changing from the supine to 
long sitting position, the upper limb was stretched out along 
the trunk, parallel to the torso and vertical to the bed. This 
meant that the hand position was not changed in both the 
supine and long sitting positions. 
Finger blood flows were compared between the supine 
and long sitting positions before SGB and 20 min after SGB. 
Next, we calculated the finger blood flow ratio as (the lowest 
finger blood flow in the long sitting position)/(finger blood 
flow in the supine position) both before and after SGB. We 
evaluated the difference in finger blood flow ratios before 
and after SGB. Statistical analysis of the data before and 
after SGB was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test. <rs id="software-0" type="software">Stat view</rs> for Macintosh (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 5.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>.,

<p>in stent thrombosis (ST) between sirolimus eluting stents (SES) and 
paclitaxel eluting stents (PES). However, other meta-analyses have 
found SES to be superior to PES. Therefore, to solve this issue, we 
aim to compare the clinical outcomes between SES and PES during a 
follow-up period of about 1 or more years. 
We have searched Medline and EMBASE for randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) comparing SES with PES. These RCTs have been 
carefully analyzed and then different types of ST including ST defined 
by the Academic Research Consortium (ARC), acute ST, late and very 
late ST have all been considered as the clinical endpoints in this study. A 
follow-up period of about 1 year, between 1 and 2 years as well as a 
longer follow-up period between 1 and 5 years have been considered. 
Data were retrieved and combined by means of a fixed-effect model 
because of a lower heterogeneity observed among the results. Odd ratios 
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and the pooled 
analyses were performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">RevMan</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.3</rs> software. 
Twenty-nine studies from 19 RCTs comprising of 16,724 patients 
(8115 patients in the SES group and 8609 patients in the PES group) 
satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. 
No significant differences in ST have been observed between SES and 
PES. Results were as follow: definite ST with OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.64-
1.18, P ¼ 0.36; probable ST with OR:0.72; 95% CI: 0.42-1.21, 
P ¼ 0.21; definite, probable and/or possible ST with OR: 0.94; 95% 
CI: 0.75-1.17, P ¼ 0.57; acute ST with OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.38-2.56, 
P ¼ 0.98; subacute ST with OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.41-1.25, P ¼ 0.25; 
early ST with OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.53-1.25, P ¼ 0.34; late ST with OR: 
0.72; 95% CI: 0.39-1.34, P ¼ 0.30; very late ST with OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 
0.72-1.44, P ¼ 0.92; and any ST with OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.69-1.07, 
P ¼ 0.18. Long-term ST between 1 and 5 years with OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 
0.71-1.22, P ¼ 0.60 was also not significantly different. 
No significant difference in ST has been observed between patients 
treated with either SES or PES. Hence SES and PES can both be 
considered almost equally effective. </p>

Afterward, the intrarater reliability, as well as the inter-
rater reliability of the score for each variable and sum, were 
evaluated by Cohen's unweighted k-value and Spearman' s 
rank order correlation. For the statistical distinction of the 
Kappa values, the distinction according to the guideline of 
Viera and Garrett [13] was applied (Table 3). In addition, 
the sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by the percent 
of correct treatment protocols according to the sum of the 
TLICS and the treatment actually performed on the patients. 
The validity of selecting treatment protocols according to 
this classification was also assessed. SPSS <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 13.0</rs> (SPSS </p>

<p>This is particularly true in the case of experience goods, whose quality is unobserved at the time of purchasing, and only 
becomes known after consuming and "tasting" the product. 2 Travelers, for example, would be remiss to reserve an <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> 
property without first consulting online reviews to ensure that previous guests confirm the host-reported quality. For their part, 
hosts would be equally remiss not to incorporate this fact into the pricing strategy. Here, eWOM can bridge the information 
gap between past consumers and potential consumers and help turn views into purchases. Indeed, Aerosolve, the dynamic open-
source algorithm used by <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> to provide hosts with date-specific price suggestions, prioritizes the capture of a first and second 
review via penetration pricing. The fact that a property has no reviews is a negative "feature", which puts significant downward 
pressure on the suggested price. Even in a machine-learning environment (as in the <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> case), prices provide a signal from 
which consumers can infer product quality, even as they influence the rate of information transmission via interpersonal com-
munication. 
Empirical evidence shows the positive effect of eWOM on sales for experience goods 3 (Chevalier &amp; Mayzlin, 2006; Cui, 
Lui, &amp; Guo, 2006; Duan, Gu, &amp; Whinston, 2008; Liu, 2006; Lu, Ba, Huang, &amp; Feng, 2013). Moreover, eWOM is shown to 
be particularly influential for recently introduced goods: the volume of reviews has a significant effect on new product sales in 
the early period and decreases over time (Liu, 2006; Zhu &amp; Zhang, 2010). On the other hand, extensive economic literature has 
explored the optimal pricing strategy and dynamics for new products of initially uncertain quality. Nevertheless, most signaling 
models have ignored learning from others and the question of whether and how interpersonal communication across consumers 
affects or is affected by prices. It is therefore interesting to study how a high-quality seller can take strategic advantage of 
experimentation and WOM when choosing his pricing strategy. This paper addresses these questions by providing a simple 
model in which WOM communication is combined with strategic pricing and signaling. 
Specifically, I consider a two-period model, in which a long-lived monopolist introduces a new experience good of unknown 
quality to consumers. The monopolist is privately informed about his type (either high or low), and a high-type seller is more 
likely to produce high-quality products. Consumers are short-lived and the satisfaction they receive from buying is a function of 
both objective quality and personal preference (or taste). First-period consumers can only rely on prices to infer the monopolist's 
type (and therefore expected quality). Second-period consumers, on the other hand, learn through the observation of noisy signals 
of past prices and observed quality. Notably, past prices are not directly observable, as public price information usually refers to 
the posted price, which does not accurately reflect the final transaction price because sales, discounts, and/or geographic price 
variations are not taken into account. Furthermore, consumers have been shown to have imprecise memories when it comes to 
the final price paid for the product. 4 Still, past consumers report through WOM communication the satisfaction obtained from 
the product, if purchased. Reports from past consumers are noisy signals of the observed quality as higher satisfaction can come 
either from high quality or from strong personal preference. Moreover, communication between past and present consumers 
is incomplete because social interaction remains limited by time, geography, and other constraint. 5 Nevertheless, information 
gathered through WOM communication is more precise when the fraction of consumers who bought in the past is high. 
I focus on the role of prices as signals of quality when consumers learn in equilibrium through both prices and WOM com-
munication. First, I characterize the benchmark case without WOM communication among consumers, and show that there is 
no separating equilibrium. I then show that, when allowing for WOM communication, there exists a separating equilibrium in 
which prices signal quality. Given a sample information structure, I study how the separating equilibrium responds to variation 
in the signal precision and compare consumer welfare in the benchmark and WOM case. Finally, I present model extensions. 
The main result is that WOM communication is essential for the existence of separating equilibria. Moreover, in any separating 
equilibrium, the high-quality monopolist signals quality through a low introductory price (lower than the monopoly price). 
The intuition is simple: low prices are costly, and will only be used by firms confident enough that increased experimentation 
(therefore communication among consumers) will yield good news about quality and increased future profits. The low-quality 
monopolist, on the other hand, avoids information transmission by choosing a higher price (the monopoly price), which limits 
sales and the possibility of learning through WOM. An additional implication: for the high-quality seller, the expected price 
(quantity) is increasing (decreasing) over time; whereas for the low-quality one, the opposite is true. Since the second-period 
price is a function of beliefs, it will be higher (lower) if good (bad) news is revealed in the first period when the product 
is introduced. Moreover, the (low) separating price charged by the high-quality monopolist in equilibrium decreases as the 
impact of signaling on consumers' beliefs increases: a high-quality seller must work harder to discourage the low-quality one 
from mimicking its behavior if consumers pay less attention to their peers' reports. Finally, consumers are better off with WOM 
communication. As a robustness check, I show that WOM communication and advertising can be either substitute or complement 
instruments for the firm. In particular, when allowed to use WOM, the firm will never use "money-burning" advertising as a 
signal of quality. On the contrary, when advertising is demand-enhancing, firms might use both instruments to signal quality. 
Finally, the equilibrium is robust to reporting bias by first-period consumers. </p>

<p>Methods: A total of 47 clinical mold isolates were used in this study, including Aspergillus 
and Trichophyton. All isolates were identified by phenotypic properties, such as growth 
rate, colony morphology, and reproductive structures. PCR and direct sequencing, target-
ing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the D1/D2 region of the 28S subunit, and 
the ß-tubulin gene, were performed using primers described previously. Comparative se-
quence analysis by using the GenBank database was performed with the basic local align-
ment search tool (<rs type="software">BLAST</rs>) algorithm. </p>

<p>The amplified sequences were compared with the GenBank 
(NCBI) database using the basic local alignment search tool 
(<rs type="software">BLAST</rs>) algorithm. Using a calculated percent identity score, 
specimens were assigned to a genus and species, as previously 
described [6, 7]. Briefly, a sequence was assigned to a species 
if the best matching reference sequence showed ≥ 98% homol-
ogy and the next best matching reference species showed 0.8%, 
or less, sequence homology. A sequence was assigned to the 
genus level on the basis of 95% to 98% homology to the best 
matching sequence or ≥ 98% homology with sequence entries 
for several species from the same genus. 'No identification' was 
defined as &lt; 95% homology with the best matching reference 
sequence or a sequence homology &gt; 95% with various genera. 
Discrepant results between phenotypic and sequence-based 
identification methods were resolved by repeating the sequenc-
ing and re-evaluation of the phenotypic method. </p>

<p>Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry. Mammary glands from 
normal FVB, KLuc f/+ , and KB1 f/f Luc f/+ mice and mammary tumors from 
KB1 f/f p53 f/f mice were fixed in formalin, processed, and embedded in paraf-
fin for sectioning. 5-µm paraffin sections were dewaxed and rehydrated ac-
cording to standard procedures. 
In case of staining with anti-Luc (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-CK14 (Co-
vance), microwave antigen retrieval using 10 mM Tris EDTA, pH 9, was used. 
Primary Abs were incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary Abs were applied 
after washing using 1× PBS (Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit and Cy3-conjugated 
anti-mouse; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and were incu-
bated at room temperature for 45 min. Slides were washed with PBS and 
mounted using Entellan. Imaging was performed on a DM6000 fluorescent 
microscope (Leica) with appropriate filter sets and high-resolution camera 
(C4742-80; Hamamatsu Photonics) in conjunction with Volocity acquisition 
software (version 4.0). 
In case of staining with anti-NQO1 Ab (Abcam), antigen retrieval was 
performed in 1 µM EDTA, pH 9.0, and sections were incubated overnight at 
4°C with the primary Ab. Antigen-Ab complexes were visualized using the 
VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit followed by 3,3-diaminobenzidine staining 
(DAB; Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Specimens were viewed with a brightfield and

<p>The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) captures the antidisciplinary ethos 
of the MIT Media Lab. Like the Lab, it opens new connections between 
science and design, encouraging discourse that breaks down the barriers 
between traditional academic disciplines. It explores not only the design 
of science, but also the science of design. 
With this innovative approach, JoDS intends to incite much-needed 
change in academic publishing by challenging traditional academic silos 
as well as the established publishing practices associated with them. 
The journal is hosted on an open-access, open-review, rapid 
publication platform called <rs id="software-3" type="software">PubPub</rs>, created by <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">students at the Media Lab</rs>. <rs type="software">PubPub</rs> is a collaborative publication environment with rich 
commenting features, and powerful, intuitive authoring tools. JoDS 
articles are authored directly within the <rs type="software">PubPub</rs> environment, which 
provides support for multimedia, image integration, and large data sets. 
Unlike journals that operate within a formal peer review system and 
rigid disciplinary framework, JoDS invites jargon-free communication 
across all fields of design and science, unconventional formats, and 
widespread community participation. JoDS empowers authors to engage 
in fruitful, ongoing discussion about their work with members of many 
different communities, both within and outside of their home disciplines. 
This rich, peer-to-peer approach to review provides for a much broader 
array of perspectives, new pathways forward, and emergent topics for 
further research.

<p>In silico search for binding sites in BOB.1/OBF.1 pro-

of the <rs id="software-1" type="software">Genomatrix</rs> software tool (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Genomatrix Company</rs>). </p>

<p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Qiagen) and 
reverse transcribed using moloney murine leukemia virus 
reverse transcriptase (Roche). Quantitative PCR were per-
formed using qPCR-SYBR-Green (Roche). Primers 
ordered from Biomers were designed using '<rs id="software-2" type="software">Universal

Quantification of gene regulation was performed by the 
ÁÁCp method using RPL13 as house-keeping gene. </p>

<p>Previously, the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter was analysed to 
identify regulatory elements responsible for its activity in 
B cells (34-36). In those studies, a functional cAMP 
responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/Activating 
Transcription Factor (ATF) site could be identified, 
which is crucial for the B lymphocyte specific activity of 
the promoter. In addition, a sequence related to a NFAT 
binding site was described, however without any func-
tional relevance for the B cell-specific BOB.1/OBF.1 
promoter activity. In search for possible additional tran-
scription factor binding sites using the <rs type="software">Genomatrix</rs> 
Software, we identified two combined NFAT/NF-kB 
binding sites within the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter. Both 
newly identified sites are conserved between rat, mouse 
and man, suggesting a possible functional relevance of 
these regulatory elements. In contrast to B cells, where a 
function of the predicted NFAT binding site has not been 
revealed (34), an inducible complex formation could be 
detected after P/I treatment of primary CD4 
+ T cells. 
This complex resembles that formed at the NFAT site of 
the IL2 promoter used in control experiments (Figure 2B, 
lane 2; and C, lane 2). In addition, an inducible complex </p>

<p>In order to investigate the likelihood that effect sizes were 
subjected to publication bias, the trim and fill procedure of 
Duval and Tweedie 
24 and the visual inspection of the funnel 
plot were used. The meta-analysis was performed using the 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Comprehensive Meta-analysis</rs> software, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 2.00</rs>. </p>

<p>Real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from tissues using RNA STAT-60 
(Tel-Test, Inc.), treated with DNase I (RNase-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 
and reversely transcribed into cDNA with random hexamers using the SuperScript II 
First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Primers for each mRNA were designed 
using <rs type="software">Primer Express Software</rs> (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) based on sequence data 
from GenBankTM (Table S1 and ref. 38) and were validated as described </p>

<p>(Bennett et al., 2007). Significant repression was seen in up to six 
cell tiers from the margin (Figure 3A). Importantly, staining for all 
induced Nodal target genes, including eGFP, was consistently 
stronger in a cluster of cells directly proximal to the YSL, where 
signaling originates (Figure 3A). 
To corroborate the data obtained from the sections, we used a 
direct readout of the Nodal pathway, fluorescent immunostain-
ing of whole-mount 50% epiboly embryos with an antibody 
against P-Smad2. For comparison, we also stained for P-Erk. 
Nuclear P-Smad2 staining was observed exclusively in the 
margin and, as expected, in a smaller domain than the P-Erk 
staining (Figure 3C). To quantitate the size of the P-Smad2-
positive domain, we imaged the embryos at the margin, used 
<rs type="software">MetaMorph</rs> software to generate normalized nuclear staining in-
tensities, and measured the distance of each nucleus from the 
margin in control-and SB-505124-treated embryos. P-Smad2 
staining above background was found up to five to six cell tiers 
(80-90 mm) from the margin in a steep gradient, which was 
abolished in SB-505124-treated embryos (Figures 3D, 3E, and 
S5B-S5D). The staining was strongest in the nuclei of cells near-
est the YSL. Taken together with our observations from the 
Tg(ARE:eGFP) reporter line, these data demonstrate that Nodal 
signaling occurs in five to six cell tiers from the margin, closely 
mirroring the expression of the ligands. </p>

<p>performed in 10% FBS and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washes were per-
formed in PBS/1% Triton. The following primary antibodies were used: a-P-
Smad2/3 (8828; Cell Signaling Technology) and a-P-Erk (M8159; Sigma). 
Note that because of the lack of Smad3 at blastula stages, we solely detect 
P-Smad2 with the a-P-Smad2/3 antibody. DAPI was used to stain nuclei, 
and images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. For 
quantification of P-Smad2 intensity in deep cells, <rs id="software-1" type="software">MetaMorph</rs> Software 
(<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>) was used to generate P-Smad2 to DAPI ratios from at 
least three single optical slices per embryo, in three individual DMSO or SB-
505124 treated, 50% epiboly embryos. Care was taken not to select mitotic 
or overlapping nuclei or nuclei from the enveloping layer. To measure the dis-
tance of a nucleus to the margin, a line was drawn laterally at the vegetal edge 
of the margin, and the distance to the nucleus perpendicular to the margin was 
measured using the <rs type="software">MetaMorph</rs> Software. To normalize the staining intensity 
for each embryo, the average ratio of an area further than 11 cell tiers from the 
margin (&gt;165 mm) was subtracted from each measurement. The data were 
divided in 15 mm bins, representing the average size of a deep cell at 50% epib-
oly (unpublished data; Dubrulle et al., 2015). The averages of the binned data 
for each cell tier, comparing DMSO and SB-505124 treatment, were used for 
testing for statistical significant differences using paired t tests with a 95% 
confidence interval. </p>

<p>Abstract 
Background: Pain relief during labour is one of the major concerns in obstetrics; severe labor pain causes fear of 
the next pregnancy, and interferes with the mother's family relationship. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effects of Entonox during labor on reducing the 
need for pethidine (Meperidine) and fetal-maternal complications. 
Methods: This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on pregnant women who were candidates 
for vaginal delivery in Educational Hospitals of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran between January 
2014 and November 2015. After entering into the inactive phase of labor, participants were randomly allocated to 
receive inhaled Entonox gas (n=200) or inhale Oxygen (n=200) as a control group. Mothers inhaled the gas at 
commencement of pain, and ceased as soon as the pain diminished, up to the end of the second stage of labor 
which was the neonate's birth. Main outcomes were pain score based on NRS (numerical rating scale), duration of 
delivery, required pethidine, maternal complications and satisfaction during labour. Chi-square and Independent 
T-test were used via <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> for data analysis and P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Results: Four-hundred pregnant women with a mean age of 26.4±5.9 years were studied. Complications such as 
nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness were reported in 25% of the Entonox group and 23% in the control 
group (p=0.640). Mean of pain severity score during labor in the Entonox and control groups was 4.5±1.2 and 
5.2±1.4, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Pethidine requirement, significantly was lower in the Entonox group (31.6±11.8 
versus 35.7±12.4; p&lt;0.001). 
Conclusion: In our study, Entonox significantly reduced pain during delivery without significant increase in 
maternal and neonatal complications. 
Trial registration: The trial is registered at the Iranian Clinical Trial Registry (IRCT.ir) with the IRCT 
identification number IRCT2015102713159N6. 
2. Material and Methods 
2.1. Research design and setting 
This double-blind clinical trial study was performed on pregnant women who were candidates for vaginal 
delivery in three main referral teaching hospitals of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran 
between January 2014 and November 2015. </p>

<p>2.9. Statistical analyses 
Statistical analysis was performed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 16</rs>. For nominal variables, chi-square test was 
used and if needed, Fisher's exact test was performed. Kolmogorov-Simonov was used to determine normality of 
distribution. For comparative dependent data, paired T-test (parametric) and if non-parametric, Wilcoxon test 
were used. For comparing the independent data, independent-samples t-test (parametric) was used and if non-
parametric, Mann-Whitney U test was used. In all measurements p-value less than 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. </p>

<p>Background: Decentralization and task shifting has significantly improved access to 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). Many studies conducted to determine the attrition rate in Ethiopia 
have not compared attrition rates between hospitals and health centers in a relatively recent 
cohort of patients. This study compared death and loss to follow-up (LTFU) rates among ART 
patients in hospitals and health centers in south Ethiopia. 
Methods: Data routinely collected from patients aged older than 15 years who started ART 
between July 2011 and August 2012 in 20 selected health facilities (12 being hospitals) were 
analyzed. The outcomes of interest were LTFU and death. The data were entered, cleaned, and 
analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 20.0</rs> and <rs id="software-1" type="software">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 12.0</rs>. 
Competing-risk regression models were used. 
Results: The service years of the facilities were similar (median 8 and 7.5 for hospitals and health 
centers, respectively). The mean patient age was 33.7±9.6 years. The median baseline CD4 count 
was 179 (interquartile range 93-263) cells/mm </p>

<p>Data were entered, cleaned, and analyzed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 20.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">IBM Corporation</rs>, Armonk, NY, USA). Each questionnaire was 
given a unique identification number for entry to simplify 
data cleaning. Tables, graphs, and different statistical sum-
mary measures were calculated based on the nature of the 
variables and their distribution. The time-to-event method 
was used to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up (LTFU) </p>

<p>or death after initiation of ART across independent variables. 
Because of the competing outcomes of death and LTFU, the 
cause-specific Cox models commonly used for time-to-event 
analysis would yield biased estimates. Therefore, the multi-
variate analysis and estimation of the cumulative incidence 
of LTFU and mortality were performed using competing 
risk regression models taking the other events of interest as 
the competing event. The data were entered into <rs type="software">Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences</rs> software, saved as <rs id="software-4" type="software">Stata</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 8SE</rs>, and exported to Stata statistical software (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Stata Corporation</rs>, Release 12, College Station, TX, USA). The 
regression analysis and cumulative incidence of LTFU or 
death was conducted using <rs id="software-5" type="software">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">version 12.0</rs>. We decided a 
priori to include selected variables in the multivariate model. 
Missing data for each factor was modeled as a separate cat-
egory. For all statistical tests, the level of significance was 
set at a type I error of 0.05. </p>

<p>prevents Microsoft from receiving royalties from computer manufacturers on a per-
processor basis, regardless of whether Microsoft's Windows operating system was 
installed on those machines. Under this provision, a firm effectively pays twice for 
the operating system if it installs an operating system owned by a Microsoft rival-
once to the rival and once to Microsoft-but it pays only once for a computer with 
Microsoft's operating system installed. Gilbert and Shapiro (1997) characterize this 
provision as a ''penalty clause.'' It raises the costs for firms with rival operating 
systems seeking to induce computer manufacturers to adopt a competing operating 
system for some product lines, and could thus protect Microsoft's alleged monopoly 
power in operating systems. 
In the 1995 Microsoft case, the Justice Department was seeking to protect com-
petition in innovation as much as price competition. Protecting incentives for inno-
vation is a common recent theme at the antitrust enforcement agencies. Another ex-
ample occurred when two pharmaceutical producers, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, sought 
to merge in 1996. The FTC obtained a consent settlement requiring the merged firm 
(Novartis) to sell off one of the competing research and development efforts in genetic 
engineering to a third firm to protect competition in innovation. Moreover, in a new 
round of Microsoft litigation, the Justice Department is currently asking a court to 
determine whether Microsoft's integration of Internet browser software into Windows 
harms innovation and tends to create or maintain monopoly by excluding rivals selling 
browsers such as <rs type="software">Netscape</rs> (DOJ's view), or promotes innovation and competition by 
improving software design (Microsoft's position). </p>

<p>Statistical Methods 
The data were analyzed using descriptive 
and inferential statistics (t-test, paired t-test, 
ANOVA) through <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 16</rs>. Kol-
mogorov-Smirnov test was used to check 
the normality of data. 
T-test was used to compare differences of 
mean scores in actual and preferred clinical 
learning environments between males and 
females. ANOVA was used to compare dif-
ferences of mean scores in actual and pre-
ferred clinical learning environments be-
tween age, and grade point average. Paired 
t-test was used to compare differences of 
mean scores between nursing students ac-
tual and preferred clinical learning envi-
ronments. </p>

<p>removed inside the port to minimize the chance of wound 
contamination. 
The data collected included age, gender, operating time, 
length of hospital stay, second port insertion, conversion 
to open surgery and complications. The statistical analyses 
were performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 11.5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, 
IL, USA). The data was expressed as the mean ± standard 
deviation. Mann-Whitney U and t-tests were used for the 
statistical analysis. P &lt; 0.05 was accepted as statistically 
significant. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis 
Data were evaluated by one way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) followed by the 
Tukey's post hoc test. Repeated ANOVA 
were run for MWM traveled distance and 
escape latency data. Analyses were per-
formed using <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>. Significance level was 
set at p&lt; 0.05. Values were expressed as 
mean ± SEM. </p>

<p>The experiments were carried out in a multi-chamber with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) 
system housing a SPECS variable temperature STM with a base pressure of less than 
2 3 10 
210 mbar. Si (111)-(7 3 7) surfaces were cleaned by degassing samples at 
, 600uC for 12 h and then flash annealing at , 1200uC with direct current sample 
heating for 15-30 s under UHV conditions. After several hours of degassing, full-
erene (Aldrich, purity 99%) was evaporated from a Knudsen cell at 623 K onto the Si 
surfaces at room temperature. STM-images were acquired at room temperature with 
a chemically etched W tip. Positive voltage indicates that the samples were biased 
positively with respect to the tip. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were 
performed by plane-wave-based Vienna Ab-initio simulations package [<rs type="software">VASP</rs>] </p>

<p>The primary study outcome was in-hospital, 30-day, and 
1-year mortality after surgery. The second outcomes 
were postoperative complications. General complica-
tions included the following: acute cardiovascular events, 
acute respiratory events, stroke, delirium, renal disease, 
electrolyte disturbances, anemia, hypoxemia, deep wound 
infection, and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embo-
lism. We also collected data on waiting time to operation, 
duration of surgery, length of postoperative hospital stay, 
admission to intensive care, hospital costs, blood loss, and 
transfusion. 
For continuous parameters, Student's t-tests are used to 
test for differences between groups, and for discontinuous 
parameters, chi-square statistics are used to detect differ-
ences between groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analysis of all variables was used for 30-day and 
1-year mortality after surgery. The significance level was set 
at 5% (P,0.05) for all statistical tests. Data were coded and 
stored in <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> <rs id="software-0" type="software">Excel</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2007</rs> and analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Statistical

U87/shNT or U87/shPKM2 cells were treated with or without H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM, 4 h). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to ex-
amine mRNA levels of Bcl2. Data represent the means ± SD of three independent experiments. (H) U87/shPKM2 cells were 
pretreated with or without MG132 for 0.5 h, followed by treatment of H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM) for 4 h. (I) U87/shNT or U87/shPKM2 
cells were infected with a lentivirus expressing SFB-Bcl2. The cells were pretreated with MG132 for 0.5 h and then treated

PKM2 WT or ILLL were treated with or without H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM, 1 h). Pull-down of SFB-PKM2 proteins was performed with 
streptavidin agarose beads. (F-H) U87 cells were depleted of endogenous PKM2 and then reconstituted with the expression 
of rPKM2 WT or rPKM2 ILLL (F). The cells were treated with or without H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM) for 4 h (G, H). The cells were pretreat-
ed with MG132 for 0.5 h before H 2 O 2 treatment (G). (I) U87 cells that stably express SFB-Bcl2 were treated with or without 
H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM, 1 h). SFB-Bcl2 complex was precipitated using streptavidin agarose beads. A peptide competition assay was 
performed by mixing precipitated SFB-Bcl2 complex with 1.0 µg synthesized Flag or PKM2 389-405 peptides. (J, K) U87 
cells that stably express SFB-Bcl2 were infected with a lentivirus expressing HA-tagged PKM2 389-405 peptide or Flag pep-
tide and then treated with or without H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM) for 1 (J) or 4 h (K). SFB-Bcl2 complex was precipitated using streptavidin 
agarose beads (J). Expression of Flag or PKM2 peptides was examined using dot blot assay with anti-HA antibody. </p>

<p>Cells were fixed and incubated with primary antibodies, Alexa 
Fluor dye-conjugated secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 
according to the standard protocols. Cells were examined using 
a deconvolution microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) with 
a 63-Å oil immersion objective. <rs id="software-3" type="software">Axio Vision</rs> software from <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Zeiss</rs>

<p>Statistical analysis 
The average annual incidence of WRA with regard to sex, age, 
region, industry, and occupation was based on the size of the 
working population as estimated in 2006 by the Korean Minis-
try of Employment and Labor, 
19,20 and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were based on Poisson distribution. Industries and occu-
pations were classified using the eighth Korean Standard In-
dustrial Classification (KSIC), 
21 and the fifth Korean Standard 
Classification of Occupations (KSCO), 
22 respectively. 
Capture-recapture analysis was used to obtain a nearly unbi-
ased estimator (NUE) of the total number of WRA cases. 
23 To do 
this, the 4 reporting sources were stratified into 2 categories as 
follows: (1) the workers' compensation scheme (i.e. the Korea 
Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service), and (2) the other 
3 reporting sources (i.e. physicians' reports). Capture-recapture 
analysis was performed on specific industries and occupations 
when the number of overlapping reports was ≥7. Overlapping 
reports, i.e. duplicate cases, were defined as individuals who 
had identical names, dates of birth, resident registration num-
bers, and employers found in both reporting categories. 
The distribution of WRA cases based on sex, causal agent, 
WRA subtype, and reporting source were described over the 
study period, and annual trends were tested using the Cochran-
Armitage test for trend. <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., Cary, NC,

plus 10% fetal calf serum were added to wells, along with nega-
tive control (medium alone) or influenza virus antigens (5 µg/mL 
of split virus vaccine of each strain; H1N1, H3N2, B). Plates were 
incubated overnight (37°C, 5% CO 2 ) and developed the following 
day. The plates were read using the Immunoscan reader and as-
sociated software (<rs type="software">CTL-Europe</rs>). The negative control was sub-
tracted from the influenza virus-specific response. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were performed in <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 17</rs>, and

Diego, California). For all statistical tests, a P value of &lt; .05 was 
considered significant. ICS results were compared using t test. 
For the remaining results, analysis of variance (by the Kruskal-
Wallis test) with multiple comparisons testing was used. </p>

<p>Background : Cerebral ischemia is as a result of insufficient cerebral blood flow for cerebral metabolic functions. Resveratrol is a natural phytoalex-
in that can be extracted from grape's skin and had potent role in treating the cerebral ischemia. Apoptosis, a genetically programmed cellular event 
which occurs after ischemia and leads to biochemical and morphological changes in cells. There are some useful markers for apoptosis like Bcl-2, 
bax, and p53. The last reports, researchers verify the apoptosis with early markers like Annexin V. 
Methods : We preferred in this experimental study a model of global cerebral infarction which was induced by bilateral common carotid artery oc-
clusion method. Rats were randomly divided into 4 groups : sham, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), I/R plus 20 mg/kg resveratrol and I/R plus 40 mg/kg 
resveratrol. Statistical analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Sigmastat</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.5</rs> ve <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM</rs> <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">20</rs>. We considered a result significant when p&lt;0.001. 
Results : After administration of resveratrol, Bcl-2 and Annexin levels were significantly increased (p&lt;0.001). Depending on the dose of resveratrol, 
Bcl2 levels increased, p53 levels decreased but Annexin V did not effected. P53 levels were significantly increased in ishemia group, so apoptosis is 
higher compared to other groups. 
Conclusion : In the acute period, Annexin V levels misleading us because the apoptotic cell counts could not reach a certain level. Therefore we 
should support our results with bcl-2 and p53. </p>

<p>Background: The efficacy and safety of the combined treatment of refractory schizophrenia with 
antipsychotic medications and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remain uncertain. 
Aim: Conduct systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature in English and Chinese about ECT in 
the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. 
Methods: English and Chinese databases were searched for studies published prior to May 20, 2015 
regarding the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment of refractory schizophrenia with antipsychotic 
medications and ECT. Two researchers selected and evaluated studies independently using pre-defined 
criteria. <rs id="software-0" type="software">Review Manager</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.3</rs> software was used for data analysis. 
Results: A total of 22 randomized control studies, 18 of which were conducted in mainland China, were 
included in the analysis. Meta-analysis of data from 18 of the 22 studies with a pooled sample of 1394 
individuals found that compared to treatment with antipsychotic medications alone, combined treatment 
with antipsychotic medications and ECT had significantly higher rates of achieving study-specific criteria of 
'clinical improvement' (RR=1.25, 95%CI=1.14-1.37). Based on the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, the quality of evidence for this assessment of efficacy was 
'moderate'. However, the proportion of participants who experienced headache during the treatment was 
significantly higher in the combined treatment group (RR=9.10, 95%CI=3.97-20.86, based on a pooled sample 
of 517 from 8 studies) and the proportion who experienced memory impairment was also higher in the 
combined treatment group (RR=6.48, 95%CI=3.54-11.87, based on a pooled sample of 577 from 7 studies). 
The quality of evidence about these adverse events was rated as 'very low'. 
Conclusions: There are very few high quality randomized controlled clinical trials about the combination of 
antipsychotic medications and ECT in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. This meta-analysis found 
that the combination of antipsychotic medications and ECT could improve psychiatric symptoms in patients 
with refractory schizophrenia, but the incomplete methodological information provided for most of the 
studies, publication bias (favoring studies with better outcomes in the combined treatment group), and 
the low quality of evidence about adverse outcomes, cognitive impairment, and overall functioning raise 
questions about the validity of the results. </p>

<p>Tax data. Information on state and federal income and capital gains taxes is obtained from 
the NBER Tax Rates database. This contains marginal income tax rates by year and state for a 
representative household with $500,000 of wage income. 
13 The data set also reports maximum 
federal and state long-term capital gains tax rates by year and state, computed using the NBER 
<rs type="software">TAXSIM</rs> model. We obtain information on the maximum federal and state corporate marginal 
tax rates, for each year and state, from two government publications: the Significant Features of 
Fiscal Federalism, available for the period 1982-1995 (American Council on Intergovernmental 
Relations, 1982-1995) and the Book of the States, for the period 1996-2000 (Council of State 
Governments, 1996-2000). For each assigned patent in our data set, we use the ordinary income 
and capital gains marginal tax rates in the state of the initial patent assignee. For unassigned 
patents, we used the state of the primary inventor as identified by the USPTO. To measure tax 
rates faced by potential corporate buyers, we construct a weighted average of state corporate taxes 
where state weights are determined by the fraction of state patent applications in the technology 
class of the patent. </p>

<p>our study that focuses on patent litigation, because typically it is the owner of the patent who brings patent infringement 
actions. Nonexclusive licensees do not have the right to sue for patent infringement (Textile Prods. v. Mead Corp., 134 
F.3d 1481, 1485 Fed. Cir. 1998). An exclusive licensee may have standing to bring such a suit, but only under some 
restrictive contract arrangements (Resonant Sensors Inc. v. SRU Biosystems, Inc., no. 3:08-cv-1978-M). 
13 For details, see the description of the <rs id="software-1" type="software">TAXSIM</rs> program in Feenberg and Coutts (1993). The simulation and the 
resulting data are available at <rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">www.nber.org/∼taxsim/state-rates</rs>/. 
14 All our results are robust to dropping corporate tax rates or to using corporate tax rates in the state of the inventor, 
which assumes that trading of patents occurs only within states. </p>

<p>Step 1. Regress each of the variables in the vector of covariates X on P using local linear regression. In our setting, this 
involves running multiple regressions. The regressions were run in <rs id="software-5" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">10</rs> using the command lpoly. 
Step 2. Let ε X be the vector of residuals from the regression in step 1. Regress L on ε X using OLS with patent fixed 
effects in order to obtain an estimate of the vector β 0 . 
Step 3. Let ε be an estimate of the residual from the previous OLS regression. This is an estimate of β 1 P + E[(α + 
ψ i )T | P]. Regressing ε on P using local linear regression allows us to obtain a nonparametric estimate of ε( P). </p>

<p>of E[L| P] with respect to P is ε( P). The mean of ε( P) was calculated for each of these groups. The derivative of ε( P) 
was obtained by finite differencing across neighboring groups. The confidence intervals of the marginal treatment effects 
were obtained using 50 bootstrap iterations (seed = 123 in <rs id="software-6" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">10</rs>). </p>

<p>Note: Capital gains tax rates for the period 1982-2001 are obtained from the NBER <rs type="software">TAXSIM</rs> data set. Changes in 
tax rates are equal to the number of policy changes in the capital gains tax rate for the period 1982-2001. Tax Change is 
equal to the average tax change in percentage points (or growth rates) among all the changes in the capital gains tax rate 
in a state. U.S. states with zero tax changes in the state-level capital gains tax rate are states with no state level capital 
gains tax rate (e.g., Florida). The row labeled "average" is the average across U.S. states. U.S. states are ranked according 
to the number of individually owned patents granted in the state. </p>

<p>contains the responses collected from an individual (or household) in a specific 
wave. Individuals and household can be identified by their unique identifiers 
(pnr and hnr). Apart from the two main datasets the PASS SUF includes register 
datasets, datasets with weights, self-reported welfare and labour market bio-
graphies (only for a two year retrospective period) and a few others. The PASS User 
Guide (Bethmann et al. 2013) gives in-depth information on the separate datasets 
comprising the SUF and on how to work with them. 
The administrative data in PASS-ADIAB, whose structure is identical to that 
of the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB, see Antoni et al. 
2016), consist of a number of files. The main file is the individual file that contains 
the longitudinal labour market biographies of all linked respondents. In order 
to use the linked administrative data they have to be merged to the individual 
interviews from the PASS SUF prior to analysis. To do so, one merges records 
that belong to the same person identifier pnr, which is contained in the survey 
datasets as well as in the administrative individual file. This is also shown in the 
User Guide: the procedure applicable to administrative data is similar to using 
PASS's own biography dataset (<rs type="software">Stata</rs>: ibid, Example 9.4; <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>: Fuchs et al. 2015, 
Example 1.4). 
For each employment record in the individual file, basic yearly information 
on the establishment a respondent was employed at is stored in the establishment 
file. Several extension files contain additional variables on the establishment 
level as well as on worker flows (inflows/outflows) and establishments dynamics 
(entries/exits). All establishment variables can be linked to employment records 
in the individual file using the establishment identifier betnr. 
Using the person identifier pnr, researchers can add variables on technical 
aspects of the linkage procedure on the individual level. These variables as well 
as the person identifier pnr are stored in a separate linkage quality file. Figure 2 
gives an overview of the data structure of PASS-ADIAB. </p>

<p>Statistical methods 
Statistical analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 21.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM Co.</rs>., Armonk, NY, USA). One-way analysis of vari-
ance was used to compare the clinical characteristics among 
the four groups followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test for 
continuous variables. The chi-square test was used to compare 
the categorical parameters. Normal distribution of variables 
was checked by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate 
the relationships between indices of insulin secretion and sev-
eral clinical variables (body mass index [BMI], systolic blood 
pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure, UA, TC, TG, HDL-C, 
TG/HDL-C ratio, LDL-C, FPG, and fasting insulin level). The 
distributions of TG and TG/HDL-C ratio were skewed; hence, 
we conducted Pearson linear correlation using log-transformed 
values instead of the raw data. To assess independent relation-
ships between β-cell function and the clinical variables, a mul-
tiple linear regression analysis was performed. Standardized 
coefficients (β) were determined after adjusting for age, BMI, 
SBP, UA, smoking status, and alcohol ingestion. Data were ex-
pressed as mean±standard deviation. A P values of &lt;0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>Bacterial pathogen study on Era1-silenced plants under drought 
Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (denoted as strain B75) and 
Xanthomonas translucens pv. translucens (denoted as strain B74) 
were incubated at 28 °C for 72 h on modified Wilbrink's media 
and a single colony was selected and grown in nutrient broth for 
16 hours at 28 °C. An aqueous suspension of 10 
9 colony-forming 
units ml 
-1 were inoculated by syringe infiltration on the flag leaf at 
the 3-leaf stage, and the plants were incubated in the greenhouse. 
Sterilized water was used as the negative control for inoculation 
treatments. The bacterial pathogen inoculation was done at 7 dpi 
with BSMV Era1 or BSMV 0 . In a pilot study, it was determined 
that the strains used exhibit a compatible interaction with wheat 
cv. UC1041 (data not shown). Seven days after inoculation with 
X. translucens, the leaf lesion area was quantified using digital image 
analysis using <rs id="software-0" type="software">ASSESS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">American Phytopathological Society</rs>, St. Paul, MN, USA). The experiment was arranged in a 
completely random design. There were 24 individual treatments (3 
bacterial inoculants × 2 water stress conditions × 3 silencing types) 
and each of these treatments was replicated 24 times. Statistical 
analysis was carried out using the general linear model of the <rs id="software-1" type="software">SAS</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">9.1</rs> statistical package (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC, USA). Data were 
subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for finding 
the effect of drought and Era1 silencing on disease, followed by a 
comparison of the means according to a Duncan's multiple range 
test at P &lt; 0.05. </p>

<p>obtained from information from the patients' families (age when any criteria of NINCDS-
ADRDA had appeared) from 67 present AD cases (60.5 8 10.1 years; range 44-81) was used 
for analysis. An accurate age of onset, with an error less than 1 year, was not obtained from 
the remaining 144 patients, and these were excluded from the analysis regarding the age of 
onset. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after the procedures had 
been fully explained in detail to each patient and his/her family. The present study was 
carried out in compliance with the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki 
and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Juntendo University School of Medi-
cine. 
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral white blood cells using a QIAamp DNA 
Blood Maxi kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). For the selection of SNPs, tag SNPs for PGBD1 
[ r 
2 1 0.8, minor allele frequencies (MAF) 1 0.05] were chosen from the International HapMap 
Project database (release 27, Phase II + III, February 2009, on NCBI B36 assembly, dbSNP 
b126) using the TAGGER algorithm with a successful TaqMan probe design. Additionally, a 
reported missense SNP, rs3800324 (G 1 A, Gly244Glu) showing a MAF 1 0.05 within a Japa-
nese population, was also chosen as a candidate SNP for PGBD1 from the dbSNP database 
(http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). Thus, the following 4 SNPs were investigated for 
PGBD1 : rs2142731, rs3800324, rs3800327, and rs2142730 (the 'rs' notation in front of each 
SNP represents the identification from the US National Center for Biotechnology Informa-
tion SNP cluster within the dbSNP database; http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). All of 
these SNPs were analyzed using TaqMan technology (Assay-by-Design TM ). Excluding the 
missense SNP rs3800324, all other SNPs were intronic tag SNPs (genomic map and struc-
tures of the human PGBD1 gene, including the location of the SNPs, were shown in our pre-
vious study [19] ). All investigated SNPs were typed using TaqMan technology with an 
ABI7500 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA). All probes and primers were 
designed by the Assay-by-Design service for Applied Biosystems. Polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) was done with the standard PCR MasterMix reagent kit using a 4-l volume. Addi-
tionally, to ensure the quality of the results, we confirmed the SNPs from a few randomly 
chosen individuals using a direct DNA sequencing method to check for errors in the TaqMan 
method. All genotypes determined by direct sequencing were in agreement with the geno-
types obtained by the TaqMan method for all investigated SNPs. Detailed information on 
PCR conditions and primer pairs is available upon request. APOE genotypes for all samples 
were determined according to a previous report [20] . 
Differences in age between healthy controls and patients were examined using two-
tailed Student's t test, and the 2 test was used to examine differences in gender distribution. 
For the case-control association study, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing of the 
SNPs was done using SNPAlyze V7.0 Pro (Dynacom, Chiba, Japan). The HWE tests were 
carried out for all loci in patients and controls. Differences in genotypic and allelic frequen-
cies were evaluated based on the case-control design using 2 analysis. Linkage disequilib-
rium (LD), denoted as D ', was calculated from the haplotype frequency using the expecta-
tion-maximization algorithm. The LD block was also identified using <rs type="software">SNPAlyse</rs> software 
when D ' was greater than 0.75. Case-control haplotype analysis was also performed using 
<rs type="software">SNPAlyse</rs> software. Permutation analysis was used to determine the empirical significance 
and to calculate the p values based on 10,000 replications. The global p values represent the 
overall significance using the 2 test when the observed versus expected frequencies of all 
haplotypes are considered together. Individual haplotypes were tested for association by 
grouping all other haplotypes together and applying the 2 test with 1 d.f. All p values re-
ported are two-tailed. Statistical significance was defined at p ! 0.05. </p>

<p>We performed power calculations using the Power Calculator (http://www.sph.umich. 
edu/csg/abecasis/CaTS/). Power was calculated under the prevalence of 0.05 using an addi-
tive or a multiplicative model, based on allelic frequencies of the associated markers ranging 
from 0.22 (rs2142731) to 0.44 (rs3800327), with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.057 
(rs2142731) to 1.305 (rs2142730) for the SNPs investigated and an alpha level of 0.05. 
To analyze interactions between SNPs in PGBD1 and APOE genotypes, logistic regres-
sion analysis was performed using HealthSketch version 2.5 (Dynacom). The probability (P c ) 
of an individual being a case rather than a control is assumed to be affected by a set of SNPs, 
according to the logistic model. For example, logit(P) = b 0 + b 1 x 1 + b 2 x 2 for a single SNP. Here, 
we use a coding scheme x 1 = -1, 0, 1 and x 2 = -0.5, 0.5, -0.5 for genotypes homozygous for 
major alleles, heterozygous, and homozygous for minor alleles (for APOE , 4 was assumed 
to be the minor allele, and 2 and 3 were assumed to be major alleles simultaneously), re-
spectively, to represent an additive effect with x 1 and a dominant/recessive effect with x 2 . The 
weights were estimated with the maximum likelihood method and tested by comparison 
with the null hypothesis logit(P c ) = b 0 (constant). We performed a stepwise forward selection 
procedure with two purposes: the first was to test the relationships among multiple SNPs in 
PGBD1 and the APOE genotype, and the second was to confirm the interaction among the 
SNPs if a significant association with p ! 0.05 was shown with individual logistic models. 
Multiple regression analyses were performed to estimate the relationship among the age of 
onset, APOE status, and the 4 SNPs using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS software</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">ver. 17.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">IBM, Chi- cago, Ill., USA</rs>). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 12.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">StataCorp</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2012</rs>; StataCorp LP, College 
Station, TX, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to characterise 
the cohort. Surgery was used as the denominator for all the 
analyses as there were 38 women who had undergone two separate 
procedures as part of their treatment (repeat surgeries for 
complications were excluded). In addition, it was possible that 
age, comorbidity and ASA grade could change over time in an 
individual woman. All eligible surgeries were included to calculate 
the crude or unadjusted Intra-op complication rate (CR) and for 
the Post-op CR analysis was limited to those with both hospital-
and patient-reported data. To assess how each potential predictor 
affected the CR individually, univariable logistic regressions were 
performed separately for all predictors. For Intra-op complications, 
the independent variables included age, the presence of comorbid-
ities (yes/no), type of comorbidities, BMI (continuous variable and 
categorical-underweight, normal, overweight, obese and morbidly 
obese), ASA grade (1-4), previous abdominal surgery (yes/no), 
grade of operating surgeon (consultant, sub-specialty trainee, 
general obstetrics and gynaecology trainee), surgical approach 
(laparotomy/laparoscopy), surgical complexity (1-5) and final 
diagnosis (ovarian, uterine, cervix, vulva and benign). For Post-op 
complications, two additional variables-duration of surgery (in 
hours) and EBL (o500 mls, 500-1000 mls, 41000-2500 mls, 
42500 mls) were included. 
To create a risk prediction model for both the Intra-op and 
Post-op CRs, useful predictors were identified in a multivariable 
logistic regression model by running a stepwise regression with </p>

<p>where there are a total of n Gaussian functions (that is, transitions), i, each with an 
area of a i (cm À 1 s À 1 ) and centroid frequency n i (s À 1 ). dR is the relative s.d. of the 
nanocrystal radius and n g (s À 1 ) is the bandgap frequency of the bulk material. Best 
fits of a i , n i and dR were calculated using the least squares method. Initial guesses 
for n i values were determined from the minima of the 2nd derivative of the 
spectrum or maxima of the 4th derivative of the spectrum (see detailed description 
in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs 15-21). Values of a i and dR 
were unbounded, but n i was typically bound to ±50 meV of the initial guess. All 
calculations were performed using an automated <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> script. The values of a i 
were converted to absolute oscillator strengths (f 1 ) with the following formula 54 : </p>

<p>The statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">16.0</rs> for 
Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). All the tests were 
two-tailed, and statistical significance was set as P,0.05. </p>

<p>Details of each call were captured on a standardised 
form and entered into a <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> <rs id="software-0" type="software">Access</rs> database. 
These included demographics, enquiry type, relation-
ship of caller to patient and motivation for calling. For 
each call, up to three generic medicines relating to the 
question were recorded and categorised by the 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification 
system of medicines. 
19 Of the five ATC levels, we exam-
ined medicine classes at the ATC3 level, which labels 
medicines according to their pharmacological subgroup 
(eg, antihistamines-systemic), as well as at the ATC5 
level, which identifies the chemical substance (eg, chlor-
pheniramine). Caller location was identified by postal 
code and grouped by state/territory and Accessibility/ 
Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA), a measure of the 
remoteness of areas from service centres.

population ratio was determined by dividing percentage </p>

<p>Quantitative analysis 
We conducted a retrospective quantitative analysis on all 
paracetamol-related calls. Comparisons between paraceta-
mol and 'rest of calls' were performed using a χ 
2 test for 
categorical data. Each call was originally coded for 1 of 25 
enquiry types. These were collapsed into seven question 
categories: 'efficacy' (indications for use, medicine com-
parisons, effectiveness for specific conditions or symp-
toms); 'interaction'; 'other safety' (side effects or cautions 
for use), 'administration' (dose, administration, formula-
tion or storage issues); safety in 'pregnancy and/or lacta-
tion'; 'logistics' (availability or cost) and 'miscellaneous'. 
Enquiry types were compared by patient age groups and 
other life stages, for example, during pregnancy or breast 
feeding. Concurrent medicines included in paracetamol 
calls were also compared by age groups and a special 
population, pregnant women. A two-sided p-value &lt;0.05 
was considered significant. The data were exported to 
SPSS Statistics <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">V.21</rs> for analysis (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM Corp.</rs>. SPSS Statistics 
for Windows, 23 edn. New York: IBM Corp, 2015). </p>

<p>Gradient gel electrophoresis of plasma samples 
The HDL particle diameter was determined 
according to the method described by Perusse et al 
(20), by gradient gel electrophoresis using 4 to 25% 
polyacrylamide. After the gels had been 
equilibrated at 120 V for 60 min, electrophoresis 
was performed for each gel containing the serum 
sample diluted 1:2 with sample buffer (consisting 
of 40% sucrose, 0.06% EDTA-2Na, and 0.01% BPP), 
to a volume of 20 µL. Each gel also contained 
thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, and lactate 
dehydrogenase as reference standards of known 
diameter. The gels were then electrophoresed at 
15 V for 15 min, followed by migration at 70 V for 
20 min, at 75 V for 16 h, and finally at 125 V for 8 
h. The gels were then stained for lipid overnight 
with Sudan Black, and for reference standards 
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 45 min. They 
were then decolorified with ethanol and kept 
immersed in acetic acid. The decolorified gels 
were then scanned with an image scanner (Epson 
GT-6500: Seiko Epson Corporation, Nagano, 
Japan) and analyzed using an image processing 
and analysis program for Macintosh (<rs id="software-0" type="software">NIH Image</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">1.61</rs>: <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>, United States). 
Migration distances were determined. The HDL 
particle diameter was then calculated by 
comparing the mobility of the sample with that of 
the three calibrated standards on each gel. A 
higher integrated HDL size indicated a greater 
proportion of "large" HDL particles, whereas a low 
HDL size suggested an increased prevalence of 
"small" HDL particles. Inter-and intra-assay 
coefficients of variation for the integrated HDL size

<p>Microvessel areas (MVAs) in subcutaneous xenograft 
tumors were determined by light microscopy/optical image 
analysis after immunostaining xenograft tumor sections with 
anti-CD31 as described previously [10]. The three most 
highly vascularized areas in areas of tumors near the tumor-
normal tissue interface were selected. Photographs of CD31-
immunopositive vessels in tumor sections were taken under 
a light microscope, and the cross-sectional areas of CD31-
immunopositive structures (i.e., microvessel areas) were 
quantified by capturing images, converting them to grey 
scale, and analyzing CD31-stained areas using <rs type="software">NIH Image 
Analysis</rs> software after setting one consistent intensity 
threshold for all slides. CD31-positive areas were expressed 
as pixels squared per high-power field and were measured 
for all tumors. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regres-
sion analyses were used to evaluate the association between regular 
low-UTI and frequency of UTI-ab and bladder cancer risk. Odds 
ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were adjusted for the following, potentially confounding, factors: 
age at UBC diagnosis/at time of completing questionnaire (in 
years), smoking status (categorical variable: never smokers, former 
smokers, current smokers (i.e., those who had not stopped in the 
year prior to the year of UBC diagnosis (for patients) or filling out 
the questionnaire (for controls)), cumulative smoking exposure in 
terms of pack-years of cigarettes, use of aspirin and ibuprofen/ 
brufen (yes/no), and education (categorical variable). Additional 
analyses were conducted to determine whether the associations 
differed for non-muscle invasive and muscle-invasive bladder 
cancer, age at onset of UTI (below or above sex-specific median 
age), menopausal state at onset UTI (using a threshold of 51 years 
as proxy), and smoking status (never vs ever). All analyses were 
stratified for gender. A (two-sided) P-value of less than 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were per-

<p>Bacterial strains, RNA preparation, library construction, and sequenc-
ing. E. coli K-12 MG1655 (GenBank accession no. NC_000913.2) and 
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028S 
(GenBank accession no. CP001363.1) were grown in LB medium to log 
phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD 600 ] of~0.5). Cells were harvested by 
centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min, and total RNA was extracted from bacte-
rial pellets using Tri reagent (ABI) and cleaned using Qiagen RNeasy 
columns. Genomic DNA was removed by DNase treatment, and 16S and 
23S rRNAs were eliminated using the MICROBExpress kit (ABI). Direc-
tional (i.e., strand-specific) RNA-seq libraries were prepared to maintain 
strand information (39) and were assayed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system 
(Agilent) for quality. Each library was loaded onto a single lane of a flow 
cell and sequenced using the Illumina GA II platform (35 cycles) at the 
Yale Center for Genome Analysis. Raw sequencing reads have been de-
posited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (accession no. SRA047329.1), 
and Artemis-ready files are available on request. 
Mapping of sequencing reads and quantitative PCR. Sequencing 
reads were mapped using the software program <rs type="software">MAQ</rs> (40) onto the pub-
lished E. coli (NC_000913.2) and Salmonella Typhimurium (CP001363.1) 
genomes, allowing up to two mismatches per read. The number of reads 
mapped to each nucleotide position on each strand was obtained by pars-
ing the <rs type="software">MAQ</rs> pileup file using a custom Perl script, as previously described 
(18). The expression levels of genes were estimated by identifying the 
maximum number of reads that mapped to the sense and antisense 
strands of annotated open reading frames (ORFs). Background expres-
sion levels were calculated for 53 genes (see Table S6 in the supplemental 
material) that were not expressed in a previous microarray-based study in 
exponential-phase E. coli in LB (41). Microarray data were downloaded 
from the Oklahoma University E. coli Gene Expression Database (http: 
//genexpdb.ou.edu/main/). Read depths for these genes ranged from 0 to 
19. Based on these, we used a cutoff of 20 reads to designate an asRNA as 
expressed. 
For qPCR validation of expression levels, E. coli was grown in LB 
medium, and RNA was extracted as described above. After DNase treat-
ment, cDNA was prepared from 1 g of RNA using an iScript kit (Bio-
Rad). Four loci (cdd, ldcC, napF, and ompA) were selected for qPCR, 
which was performed using SYBR green on a LightCycler instrument 
(Roche). To assess the similarity between expression estimates from Illu-
mina sequencing and qPCR, we calculated the Pearson correlation coef-
ficient between log-transformed maximum read depth and the qPCR cy-
cle threshold (C T ), applying a one-tailed test of significance (see Fig. S1 in 
the supplemental material). 
For qPCR validation of asRNAs, three independent E. coli samples 
were grown in LB and RNA was extracted, as described above. After 
DNase treatment, cDNA was prepared from 500 ng of RNA and asRNA-</p>

<p>specific primers using a SuperScript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitro-
gen). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 50°C for 30 min, followed by 
enzyme inactivation at 70°C for 15 min. qPCR was performed on a Mas-
tercycler instrument (Eppendorf), and the intraclass correlation among 
the replicate C T values obtained for each sample was determined using the 
irr package in the software environment R v2.8.0 (see Fig. S2). 
Identification of antisense TSSs. After RNA-seq reads were mapped 
to the respective genome, the antisense strands of all protein coding genes 
were scanned using a custom Perl script to identify regions with a read 
depth of at least 200. These genes were then manually inspected in Artemis 
to determine the positions of upshifts in coverage to identify putative TSSs 
(30) (Fig. 1). Antisense TSSs that were located at the 5= ends of three 
protein-coding genes (ybaN and STM14_1994 in Salmonella, and yneJ in 
E. coli) were excluded from further analysis because they potentially rep-
resent the TSSs of the divergently transcribed adjacent genes. 
Identification of ؊10 promoter elements. DNA binding of the 70 
transcription factor is mediated by a promoter region that consists of two 
short motifs positioned approximately 10 and 35 bp upstream of the TSS 
(42). The Ϫ10 element is particularly indispensable and has a core se-
quence with the 6-bp consensus TATAAT (43, 44). This motif is highly 
degenerate, however, since promoter elements often have imperfect 
matches to the consensus and can be located anywhere in a window rang-
ing from approximately 4 to 18 bp upstream of the TSS (44). Therefore, to 
identify potential Ϫ10 elements associated with antisense TSSs, we 
searched this 15-bp window for any hexamers that matched at least 4 of 
the 6 bp in the consensus sequence including the two most highly con-
served positions, A2 and T6 (23). This approach could potentially miss 
some legitimate Ϫ10 elements because many documented promoters are 
too divergent to satisfy these criteria (45). 
To produce a null expectation for the observed frequency of Ϫ10 
elements, we generated 1,000,000 sets of randomly sampled antisense po-
sitions in each genome and determined the fraction of sites in each set that 
contained a Ϫ10 element satisfying the criteria described above. 
Analysis of nucleotide sequence divergence and polymorphism. 
Patterns of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism were analyzed to 
infer whether promoter regions regulating asRNA expression are subject 
to functional constraint. To calculate levels of nucleotide sequence diver-
gence, protein-coding gene sequences containing identified antisense 
TSSs were extracted from the genome sequence of either E. coli 
(NC_000913.2) or Salmonella (CP001363.1) and aligned with ortholo-
gous sequences from the other species. Codon-based nucleotide align-
ments were generated by aligning translated amino acid sequences using 
the software program <rs id="software-8" type="software">MUSCLE</rs> <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">v3.7</rs> and then converting them back to 
nucleotide sequences (46). Divergence values were calculated using third 
codon positions only, which are largely synonymous and thus less suscep-
tible to selection acting on the sense-strand-encoded amino acid se-
quence. Alignment gaps were excluded from divergence estimates. 
Average divergence levels between E. coli and Salmonella were calcu-
lated based on the distance to the antisense TSS. To test the hypothesis that 
purifying selection acts to constrain sequence evolution in antisense pro-
moter regions, the divergence data were partitioned into two categories: 
(i) an antisense promoter region consisting of the TSS along with 50 
upstream and 10 downstream nucleotides on the antisense strand and (ii) 
the rest of the surrounding protein-coding gene. A paired t test was im-
plemented in R v2.8.0 to compare levels of nucleotide divergence between 
these two partitions. In addition, divergence data within the antisense 
promoter region were visualized using a sliding-window analysis with a 
window size of 9 bp and a step size of 1 bp. 
The above comparison between E. coli and Salmonella was repeated 
using E. coli and its more closely related congener Escherichia fergusonii 
(NC_011740.1). In addition, a similar analysis was performed using the 
number of segregating sites in multiple alignments generated from com-
plete genome sequences of 41 strains of E. coli (see Table S7 in the supple-
mental material). Note that this set of genomes included some isolates 
that are taxonomically placed in the genus Shigella based on their patho-</p>

<p>genic properties but are phylogenetically nested within E. coli (47). Only 
genes that were present in at least 10 of the strains were included in this 
polymorphism analysis. 
To provide a basis of comparison for the patterns of nucleotide diver-
gence and polymorphism observed in antisense promoter regions, we 
identified TSSs for a set of highly expressed protein-coding mRNAs (max-
imum read depth of at least 200) in E. coli and Salmonella (67 and 55 loci, 
respectively). For this set of control loci, we extracted gene sequences 
along with associated 5= regions extending 200 bp upstream of the iden-
tified TSS from the same sets of genomes described above. Nucleotide 
alignments were performed in <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs>, and sequence divergence and 
polymorphism values were calculated as described above, except that 
there was no filtering based on codon position for upstream noncoding 
sequences. Genes with unalignable upstream regions were excluded from 
the analysis. 
For both interspecific and intraspecific comparisons, putative or-
thologs were identified as pairs of genes that returned top hits in reciprocal 
searches between a pair of genomes with <rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">NCBI</rs> <rs id="software-10" type="software">tBLASTn</rs> <rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">v2.2.24</rs> (48). All 
analyses were conducted with custom Perl scripts utilizing BioPerl mod-
ules (49). </p>

<p>I have recently suggested a political compromise of 
subjecting employer payments for health insurance to the 
payroll tax (Feldstein 2017) rather than the income tax. 
Doing so would produce revenue of about $135 billion this 
year, reducing the overall deficit by that amount and adding 
it to the Social Security Trust Fund. The increase in the size 
of the Trust Fund would postpone the time when the Trust 
Fund would be depleted, requiring either a substantial cut 
in Social Security benefits or a significant increase in taxes 
to pay the benefits. 
More generally, subjecting health insurance benefits to 
either the income tax or the payroll tax would raise revenue 
without increasing marginal tax rates and would therefore 
not reduce incentives to work or to invest. 
An alternative to eliminating a few deductions and 
exclusions would be to put an overall limit on the amount 
that a taxpayer can benefit from such tax expenditures. 
That might be politically easier to enact since no group of 
taxpayers would feel that they were being singled out to 
lose their deductions. A few years ago, Dan Feenberg, 
Maya MacGuineas, and I (2011) proposed such a plan, 
allowing each individual to benefit from the full range of 
tax expenditures but limiting the resulting tax reduction to 
two percent of that taxpayer's adjusted gross income. 
Simulations using the <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">NBER</rs> <rs id="software-0" type="software">TAXSIM</rs> model projected 
that such a cap would have raised $278 billion in 2011. A 
two percent cap would also cause substantial simplification 
by inducing more than 35 million taxpayers to shift from 
itemizing their deductions to using the standard deduction. </p>

qPCR was conducted as for rat retina, except that mouse sequence-specific 
primers for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the housekeeping

planned to become pregnant after dis-
charge. We randomized the patients by as-
signing to the case and control groups al-
ternately in the order of their admission. 
Patients were evaluated at one and four 
months after operation and after starting 
medical treatment by office visits and tele-
phone inquiry for severity of their endome-

tients did not have any other medical or

treatment, liver function tests, serum urea, 
creatinin, lipids and plasma glucose were 
checked.

<p>We used single turnover kinetics experiments under 
saturating enzyme conditions ([E] &gt; [S] &gt;&gt; K d ) to obtain 
a rate constant (k max ) that is not influenced by product 
release or product inhibition. This is important because 
TDG exhibits very slow product release and strong 
product inhibition, which dominates k cat values 
determined using steady-state kinetics (19,32,33). 
Experiments were collected at room temperature (23 
C) 
in HEMN.1 buffer (0.02 M HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 
2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 M NaCl). Experiments were initiated 
by adding concentrated TDG to buffered substrate, 
followed by rapid mixing. At various time points, 
aliquots were removed, quenched with 50% (v:v) 0.3 M 
NaOH and 0.03 M EDTA, and heated at 85 
C for 
15 min to cleave the DNA backbone at enzyme-produced 
abasic sites. The fraction product was determined by 
HPLC (21,24). The data were fitted to Equation (1) 
using nonlinear regression with <rs type="software">Grafit</rs> 6 (34): </p>

<p>We also determined the maximal rate of product forma-
tion using kinetics experiments as described above, but 
with saturating substrate conditions ([S] &gt;&gt; K d , and 
[S] &gt;&gt; [E]) (22,33). The data were fitted to Equation (2) 
using nonlinear regression with <rs id="software-12" type="software">Grafit</rs> <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">6</rs>: </p>

<p>Equilibrium binding of TDG to DNA was studied by fluor-
escence anisotropy using a QuantaMaster 40 
spectrofluorometer (PTI), monitoring the fluorescence 
of sulphorhodamine (Texas Red, or TR) conjugated to 
the 5 
0 -end of the non-target strand (Figure 2). Previous 
studies show the benefits of using X-rhodamine or 
sulphorhodamine for monitoring protein nucleic acid 
interactions by fluorescence anisotropy (35-37). TDG 
was titrated into HEMN.1 buffer (above) that contained 
TR-labeled DNA, supplemented with 1% glycerol and 
1 uM BSA. The DNA concentration was maintained at a 
fixed value throughout the titration by adding concentrated 
enzyme in buffer that also contained DNA. After each 
addition of TDG, the sample was incubated for at least 
2 min before data collection to ensure binding was at equi-
librium. This was confirmed by observation that the anisot-
ropy was constant for at least 5 min (for some data points). 
Anisotropy data were collected in T-format, where one 
PMT is connected directly to the sample compartment 
(no monochromator) with wavelength selection provided 
by a 628-nm band pass filter (Semrock, Inc.). The excitation 
wavelength was 590 nm (3-nm band pass) and the 
single-emission monochromator was set to 615 nm (5-nm 
band pass). Wavelength selection for the monochromators 
was enhanced with 586 and 624 nm band-pass filters 
(Semrock, Inc.) for excitation and emission, respectively. 
The equilibrium dissociation constants for TDG binding 
to TR-labeled DNA were determined by fitting the fluor-
escence anisotropy data to appropriate models using 
<rs id="software-5" type="software">DynaFit</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">4</rs> (38,39). The models and <rs type="software">DynaFit</rs> scripts used 
for data fitting are given in the Supplementary Data. The 
fitted parameters included dissociation constants for one or 
two binding sites on the DNA, and anisotropy values for 
free DNA (r D ) and for 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with TDG 
(r ED and r EED ). In many cases, the data clearly indicate two 
nonequivalent binding sites. Model discrimination was also 
informed by the probability value of the Fisher's F-statistic, 
obtained from data fitting, where P &lt; 0.05 is considered 
significant. The reported parameters are derived from 
global fitting of at least two independent binding experi-
ments. We determined the equilibrium dissociation 
constant for TDG binding to unlabeled DNA using equi-
librium competition anisotropy experiments, where TDG 
binding to TR-labeled 16U 
F 11 was monitored in the 
presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled DNA. 
<rs type="software">DynaFit</rs> was used for global fitting of the data to a 
model involving one or two TDG binding sites for the </p>

<p>unlabeled DNA and two binding sites for TR-labeled 
16U 
F 11. A benefit of using <rs type="software">DynaFit</rs> for the data presented 
here is that data fitting does not require an analytical 
equation, which could involve assumptions that are not 
compatible with experimental restraints. Indeed, the 
standard model for two nonequivalent binding sites 
assumes the species being monitored (DNA) is present at 
much lower concentration than the dissociation constant. 
This is not feasible for monitoring TDG binding to 
16U 
F 11, because the minimal DNA concentration needed 
for sufficient sensitivity in the anisotropy experiment 
(0.5 nM) approximates the dissociation constant 
(K d1 = 0.6 nM, see below). </p>

<p>adequacy of collecting rights into single ownership as a response to the underuse problems 
caused by an anticommons could be overcome, other problems remain. In practice "it is easier to 
fragment than to reconvene fragmented property" (Parisi, Schulz, and Depoorter 2004; Heller 
2008: 213). As Heller pointed out, collecting rights from an anticommons into usable private 
property bundles is often brutal and slow, and both markets and governments may fail to do so 
(Heller 1998; Heller and Eisenberg 1998). For example, "[l]and is much easier to break up than 
to put back together." Eminent domain is one way to unlock the value frozen in gridlocked land, 
"but it's a crude solution" (Heller 2008: 110, 111). 13 Obviously, it is even harder to solve the 
cross-border anticommons tragedy at the international level resulting from fragmented sover-
eignty, as Adam Smith observed in 1776 in The Wealth of Nations: "The navigation of the Danube 
is of very little use to the different states of Bavaria, Austria and Hungary, in comparison of what 
it would be if any of them possessed the whole of its course till it falls into the Black Sea"(Smith 
1789: book 1, chapter 3, paragraph 8; Buchanan and Yoon 2000; Heller 2008: 182, 183). 14 
The above points seem also true of the anticommons in knowledge. Both markets and govern-
ments may find it difficult to dissolve barriers to knowledge production assembled under priva-
tization. For example, one program can infringe many different software patents at once. <rs type="software">Linux</rs>, 
the kernel of the GNU/Linux operating system, may have infringed as many as 283 different U.S. 
software patents (Stallman 2005). A company that developed a treatment for Alzheimer's disease 
found it could not bring it to market unless it bought access to dozens of patents and "[a]ny single 
patent owner could demand a huge payoff; some blocked the whole deal" (Heller 2008: xiii). A 
final point to remember is that in this emerging new era of technocapitalism, 15 even if these for-
midable obstacles to consolidation can be overcome, the intellectual monopoly created will likely 
be detrimental to the diversity and dynamics of knowledge development, replacing the "tragedy" 
of the anticommons with the "Sargasso Sea" of monopoly. </p>

<p>Abstract The emergence of profit-based online platforms related to the Sharing 
Economy, such as <rs type="software">BlaBlaCar</rs> and <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs>, provides new means for end users to create 
an income from their possessions. With this opportunity, participants have to make 
strategic economic decisions despite limited formal expertise and information. Decen-
tralization (using digital technologies) and reputation (using user reviews) are the core 
mechanisms chosen by these platforms to mitigate these limitations and to work 
efficiently as online matchmakers. We test the performance of these two mechanisms 
by studying the allocative efficiency (in terms of value and volume of transactions) of 
simulated marketplaces under different types of motivation from the participants and 
control from the platforms. As a result, we find an inverted-U relationship between the 
decision-making leeway available to the participants and the platform's allocative 
efficiency. From the participants' perspectives, too much freedom or too many barriers 
lead to market failures affecting specific participants: low-end consumers are banned 
from the marketplace while high-end providers experience lower levels of activity. As 
governance advice for these platforms, we show the limitations of promoting these 
platforms on the sole motive of monetary rewards. </p>

<p>The Internet has dramatically changed the production and distribution of consumer goods 
and services. Users have seized these new opportunities to bypass well-established busi-
nesses for production and trade. In this research, we focus on those online platforms that give 
anyone an opportunity to share their possessions for profit -such as <rs type="software">airbnb</rs>.com, <rs type="software">blablacar</rs>. 
com and <rs type="software">turo</rs>.com. These platforms operate in a grey area between traditional marketplaces 
(supplied by formal firms) and the not-for-profit part of the Sharing Economy (Belk 2014). 
Consequently, specific forms of market governance have to be found in order to provide an 
efficient platform that would embed both profit motive and the willingness to share. 
Due to its rapid growth, this sector has been largely scrutinized in the media and in the 
academic literature. Codagnone et al. (2016) provide an extensive literature review show-
ing how the potential of these platforms is widely assumed to be correlated with regulatory 
matters. In the same line, Frenken (2017) sketches three potential futures of sharing based 
on different institutional decisions by the markets, governments and the public. Here, we 
take a different approach by showing how economic governance at the platform level alone 
can provide predictions of the potential successes and failures of the platforms. By doing 
so, we question the ability to provide economic governance by relying only on interme-
diation technologies. We show that the online platforms of the profit-based sharing 
economy are not neutral technologies. Only specific forms of governance over the 
transactions can help the platform to meet the expectations of the sharing economy to 
benefit all participants. The focus on internal governance supplements the widely discussed 
external factors of platform success and failure, e.g., the different levels of government 
regulation, the competition with other platforms or incumbents, and their social legitimacy. 
Our interest in this issue comes from the emergence of a hybrid form of governance 
between intermediation and community building. On the one hand, these platforms define 
themselves as 'intermediaries', creating an apparent proximity with other online interme-
diaries such as <rs type="software">eBay</rs>.com, <rs type="software">Craigslist</rs> or <rs type="software">Facebook</rs>, because of a strong technological 
integration with the Web 2.0 (including social networks and user reviews) (Belk 2014). 
The main difference between intermediaries and merchants is the distribution of control 
between the platform and the participants (Hagiu 2007). While the merchants keep full 
control over the sale (e.g. pricing, quantities), intermediaries only control the affiliation to 
their platform, taking the form of a two-sided platform connecting independent sellers and 
buyers. On the other hand, by putting forward the idea of sharing, these platforms position 
themselves in a moral system interested in social welfare (Botsman and Rogers 2011). 
Assuming that learning and enforcing morality is the result of both individual attributes and 
social relations (Hodgson 2014), decentralized platforms do not provide the structure for 
this kind of social enterprise. For instance, we can observe this ambiguity in the governance 
of <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs>, in which the platform emphasizes its role of intermediary by describing itself as 
"a trusted community marketplace" 
1 rather than a company or a merchant. Yet, on 
September 8th 2016, Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> addressed an email 
to the entire community of users entitled "Discrimination and Belonging". 
2 The core of the </p>

<p>to 'indivisible', to the extent that once acquired, the utility or functions provided by these 
goods cannot be changed gradually. In addition, they are 'mid-grained', meaning that 
"there will be relatively widespread private ownership of these goods and that these 
privately owned goods will systematically exhibit slack capacity relative to the demand 
of their owners" (Benkler 2004: 276). Accommodations and cars are examples of shareable 
goods that can be found on platforms such as <rs type="software">airbnb</rs>.com (renting accommodation), 
<rs type="software">blablacar</rs>.com (ridesharing) and <rs type="software">turo</rs>.com (car sharing). On all these platforms, 
individuals can share their under-utilized possessions with other individuals in a peer-to-
peer system. Other examples include household goods (such as bikes, power tools or 
ladders) that can be rented on <rs type="software">neighborgoods</rs>.org or parking spaces on <rs type="software">justpark</rs>.com. 
According to Rachel Botsman, 
3 a platform belongs to the 'sharing economy' when: 
(1) the under-utilized assets are used more efficiently by users who specifically value 
access over ownership; and (2) the platform owner / designer and the participants 
exhibit values such as transparency, respect or belonging. Botsman does not limit the 
sharing economy to the profit-based platforms: under-utilized assets can be traded for 
monetary or non-monetary benefits. By focusing our own research on platforms using 
monetary transactions, we want to understand the behavioral interplay between mon-
etary incentives (sharing for a price) and non-monetary incentives (e.g. sharing for the 
public good) that emerge on these platforms. </p>

<p>By focusing on the individual participants rather than the platform, we need to adopt a 
performance measure that will reflect this perspective (instead of plaform market shares 
or winner-take-all competition). We do so by adopting the concept of "allocative 
efficiency" (Gode and Sunder 1993, 1997). In its most generic form, "allocative 
efficiency is the ratio of the actual to the potential gains from trade" (Gode and Sunder 
1997: 603). The upper bound of the "potential gains" is reached when the participants 
can make all the transactions they desire, either as suppliers when they share their 
possessions, or as customers by accessing the shared goods. Concretely, on the demand 
side, <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> is functioning efficiently if the guests find a room when they desire to 
travel or <rs type="software">BlaBlacar</rs> is efficient when there is a seat available for one's desired journey. 
On the supply side, both the revenue and the efficient utilization of our shareable 
possessions are impacted if an <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> host or a <rs type="software">BlaBlaCar</rs> traveler cannot find a buyer. 
From the public good perspective, such a failure can be seen as proof that profit-based 
platforms cannot provide the basic level of service required by Universal Service 
obligations (Slee 2016) or provided by incumbent firms (Cusumano 2015). 
To achieve allocative efficiency, these marketplaces rely on decentralized governance 
using platform rules and complex peer-to-peer mechanisms designed to facilitate and 
control the transactions. However, both sides are affected by information scarcity, due 
not to the opportunism of the participants, but because of the difficulty to assess the exact 
content of the transaction (Benkler 2004). Usually, such uncertainty is reduced by encour-
aging the homogenization of products (norms, expectations of distribution channels or 
externalization of components) and the homogenization of tastes (marketing and confor-
mity). In a peer-to-peer market, the variety of products and tastes might be overwhelming 
(Lu and Kandampully 2016), making it very difficult (1) for the buyers to assess the quality 
of each product, and (2) for the sellers to assess the size of the demand. If it is not possible to 
change the level of information or the degree of heterogeneity, versioning is the solution 
(Shapiro and Varian 1999): the pricing should reflect the heterogeneity by proposing 
different levels of price for different matches. Bhargava and Choudhary (2004) discuss 
how a menu of differentiated services (such as "freemium") improves the allocative 
efficiency in a market characterized by heterogeneous users. However, if the versions are 
not clearly differentiated, efficiency diminishes due to the cannibalization of higher 
versions by lower versions. Marketing strategies can be used to magnify the product 
differentiation (for instance, by promoting exclusive or private access to specific categories 
of users), creating artificial search frictions. The interplay of search frictions and product </p>

<p>We present our model as an online platform for accommodations (such as <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs>): 
the customers are 'guests' who want to find a 'host' for a night at a given location. 
Below, we describe the model in three blocks / sub-sections: </p>

<p>In more detail, we learned from the literature on user reviews that reviews contribute to 
reputation building and are being used as a proxy rather than a fair source of information. 
For instance, Fradkin (2014) analyzed search data from <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> and shows that potential 
customers filter the listings based on objective variables (mostly the location and maximum 
price) before browsing the remaining listings and evaluating more subjective characteristics 
(including the number and text of reviews). Such a distinction can be found in the model of 
an online market with a self-selection bias of user reviews built by Li and Hitt (2008). In 
their model, they distinguish two classes of attributes: the 'search attributes', which can be 
inspected before the transaction, and the 'experience attributes', which are specific to each 
customer based on its experience of the product. 
Our model follows a similar approach with substep 1 using objective information 
and substep 2 being more subjective. We have two objective search attributes available 
for the guests to make a decision during substep 1: b g is the available budget of the 
guest g, and for each host h ∈ H, the guest can observe the price p h, t , i.e., the price 
requested to reserve the accommodation owned by h during night t. Using these 
attributes, during substep 1, all the guests sequentially try to find a host whose price 
is below their budget constraint and within a certain price range (r). The price range r 
gives us the opportunity to create some variations inside the scenarios, by looking at the 
effect of guests deviating more or less from their budget. For simplicity, r is the same 
for every guest inside a simulation. At the end of substep 1, for each guest g, H g is the 
subset of hosts from hosts H who are not yet booked and whose prices are below the 
budget b g , but not lower than b g − r: </p>

<p>&amp; Price Strategy: Zervas et al. (2017) point up how <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> has affected a specific 
segment of the hospitality industry, the lower-end hotels. Hotels offering business 
services do not suffer from the emergence of this platform. Guttentag (2015) 
observes that <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> is attractive to the low end of the market and covers a demand 
that is unattractive for the incumbents of the hospitality industry. <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> provides 
accommodations cheaper than hotels. Our understanding is that saving money is a 
strong motivation on these platforms: </p>

<p>platform owners can use strategically their market environment to crowd out or crowd in 
participation on their platforms (Frey and Jegen 2001). Using the literature on two-sided 
matching, obtaining information about the motivations of users can be useful ex ante to 
create the behavioral conditions represented by the scenarios. In the same line, information 
about the user characteristics (such as their budget and quality in our model) can also give 
an opportunity to the platform owner to limit the entry of participants who will systemat-
ically be excluded. By studying a few simple governance instruments in our model 
(tolerance and price range), we have shown that these instruments have non-linear and 
strongly interdependent effects. Designing these instruments of governance is difficult, 
which can explain the numerous changes and experiments performed by the platforms, as 
well as the misalignment between the motivations of the designers and those of the 
participants, as observed by Bellotti et al. (2015). 
From the participant perspective, our results echo the work of Lauermann et al. 
(2017) showing that decentralized mechanisms can achieve allocation efficiency 
even when the participants ignore the exact market condition (including their own 
characteristics), provided that the search frictions are small. To diminish the search 
friction, the platform should use all the governance mechanisms (monetary, non-
monetary and informational) at its disposal (Boudreau and Hagiu 2009; Phelps 
et al. 2008). For instance, Gode and Sunder (1997) face a similar problem when 
their double auction system cannot prevent the allocative inefficiency resulting 
from the displacement of intramarginal traders by extramarginal traders (who do 
not value the goods as much as the intramarginal traders). As a solution, they 
sketch an alternative market governance that almost mimics the mechanism of 
centralized assortative matching (e.g., bids and asks closer to actual constraints, 
delayed decisions queuing in a clearing house). In the same line, Anderson and 
Renault (1999) use search costs to explain the emergence of "tourist traps", i.e., 
options with similar characteristics and largely overpriced, because "buyers do not 
shop around". Different mechanisms can be tested to achieve such results. In 
addition to the non-monetary instruments proposed above and following the 
lessons from the two-sided market literature, the platform can regulate the behav-
iors monetarily by subsidizing the underactive participants using fees collected 
from their overpriced counterpart. The platform can also modify how the infor-
mation is displayed, for instance, to alter the tolerance and the price range of the 
participants. In fact, <rs type="software">Airbnb</rs> uses such a mechanism in the search ranking of 
accommodations. </p>

À3 M, 10 
À4 M, 10 
À5 M and 0 M. Freshly prepared 
5azaC-dR or GuaUre-dR was added to separate 10 ml 
cell cultures and incubated at 37 
C for 7 h. They were 
exposed to colcemid for 40 min (during the last 40 min 
of 7 h drug exposure) to inhibit microtubule formation 
and arrests cells in metaphase. Cells were then harvested 
by standard methods and slides were prepared. After over-
night aging at 60 
C, slides were GTG banded and 50 
metaphase cells were scored at each drug concentration 
in each of 2 separate experiments for any evidence of fra-
gility. Each cell was counted and all chromosomes were 
evaluated for elongation or breaks. Metaphases were 
captured using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Bandview</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Applied Spectral Imaging, Carlsbad, CA, USA</rs>). </p>

<p>To analyze RNA present in sucrose gradient fractions, each 
fraction was treated with 100 g/ml proteinase K (Roche) 
in the presence of 1% SDS and 10 mM EDTA for 30 
min at 42 
• C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction 
and ethanol precipitation. RNA pellets were resuspended 
in formamide and separated on 1.5% agarose gels contain-
ing 1.3% formaldehyde (34). RNA was transferred to ny-
lon membranes (Hybond N, GE Biosciences) and RNA 
was visualized by methylene blue staining. Individual RNA 
species were detected by Northern hybridizations using 
32 P-
labeled oligonucleotide probes as described (35). Sequences 
of hybridization probes used in this study are listed in Sup-
plemental Table S2. Hybridizations were analyzed using a 
Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager and <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageQuant</rs> software

data were extracted as mean and standard deviations (SDs). 
All depression scales' means and SDs at the beginning of 
treatment and after treatment in two groups were combined. </p>

<p>Data analysis and statistics. Flow cytometry data were an-
alyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star). A two-tailed, unpaired or 
paired Student's t test was performed on log-transformed 
data using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Prism</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad</rs> Software). P-values are rep-

<p>a mean was obtained by quantitative morphometry with automated image 
analysis (<rs id="software-2" type="software">Image-Pro Plus</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">Version 5.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Media Cybernatics, Houston, TX</rs>). 
Dark green-stained collagen fibers were quantified as a measure of fibrosis 
in Masson trichrome-stained sections. The collagen volume fraction (CVF) 
and perivascular collagen area/luminal area (PVCA/LA) were analyzed by 
quantitative morphometry with automated image analysis (<rs id="software-3" type="software">Image-Pro Plus</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">Version 5.0</rs>). CVF was calculated as reported previously (19). Perivascular 
collagen was excluded from the CVF measurement. To normalize the PVCA 
around vessels with different sizes, the perivascular collagen content was 
represented as the PVCA-to-LA ratio. 
Interstitial and perivascular fibrosis were evaluated by Picrosirius red 
staining. Sections were stained with 0.5% sirius red (Sigma) in saturated picric 
acid for 25 min. Collagen was stained red. 
Myocardial frozen sections (5 mm) were stained with Oil Red O (Sigma) for 
10 min, washed, and then counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s. A Nikon 
microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) was used to capture the Oil Red O-stained 
tissue sections. 
Hydroxyproline analysis. The collagen content of myocardial tissue was 
determined by hydroxyproline assay (20). Tissue hydrolysate was detected by 
use of an ELISA kit (F15649; Westang Bio-Tech, Shanghai, China). Data were 
expressed as micrograms collagen per milligram dry weight, with the as-
sumption that collagen contains an average of 13.5% hydroxyproline (21). 
Immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin sections underwent immunohisto-
chemistry by a microwave-based antigen retrieval method. The sections were 
incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen I, anti-collagen III, 
anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and anti-interleukin (IL)-6 antibodies 
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight and then with a matching biotinylated 
secondary antibody for 30 min at 37°C. Negative controls were omission of the 
primary antibody. The stained sections were developed with diaminobenzidine 
and counterstained with hematoxylin. The results were viewed under a con-
focal FV 1000 SPD laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Japan). 
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared with the TRIzol 
reagent (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR was performed using the 
following primers: b-actin, forward 59-AGA CCT TCA ACA CCC CAG-39 and 
reverse 59-CAC GAT TTC CCT CTC AGC-39; brain natriuretic protein, forward 
59-GGG CTG TGA CGG GCT GAG GTT-39 and reverse 59-AGT TTG TGC TGG

and IL-6, forward 59-ACC ACT TCA CAA GTC GGA GG-39 and reverse 592ACA 
GTG CAT CAT CGC TGT TC-39. Reactions were carried out on a real-time PCR 
thermocycler (IQ5 Real-Time PCR cycler; Bio-Rad), using SYBR green as 
fluorescence dye. Relative expression analysis involved the 2 
2 △△CT method. 
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was as described previously 
(22). We used antibodies against TRB3 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), collagen I, 
collagen III, TNF-a, IL-6 (Abcam), phospho (p)-extracellular signal-regulated </p>

<p>plaque-forming units of an adenovirus harboring TRB3 gene (TRB3-siRNA) or 
a control empty virus (vehicle). Adenovirus transfer was repeated in 2 weeks. 
According to our present and previous studies (23), TRB3 level was increased in 
HF diet-fed and high fructose-fed rats. Previous studies have shown that insulin 
resistance was a hallmark of obesity (24) and metabolic syndrome (25). In light 
of the interaction between TRB3 and insulin resistance, we also investigated the 
effect of TRB3-siRNA on HF diet-induced cardiac injury. Four weeks after the 
first adenovirus injection, rats were killed. The heart was excised and weighed.

<p>Between May 2004 and June 2009, there were 1,123 patients 
with chronic ear infections, of which 13 cases involving facial pa-
ralysis were investigated. The details described in our database 
included age at presentation, gender, affected side, associated 
symptoms, air-conduction and bone-conduction pure tone audi-
ometry, and assessment of facial nerve function using the House-
Brackmann grading system (Table 1). 
Temporal bone CTs of these patients were also reviewed. Bony 
defects in the facial canal, and combined bony defects in the cra-
nial base and bony labyrinth were analyzed. The preoperative 
and postoperative medications included antibiotics and cortico-
steroids in all but one patient who had complete facial paralysis 
managed conservatively. The type of surgery, operative findings, 
pathology, and the postoperative facial nerve functions were re-
viewed. A final assessment of facial nerve function was performed 
one year postoperatively. 
All temporal bone CTs and operation records for 254 middle 
ear cholesteatoma patients were reviewed to evaluate for radio-
logic sensitivities on facial canal, labyrinth and cranial fossa de-
hiscences in middle ear cholesteatomas. Using the temporal bone 
CT, we evaluated for facial canal dehiscence, the presences of 
combined labyrinthine fistula and cranial base defects. The size of 
facial canal dehiscence was based on operative reports. 
The differences in prevalence of bony labyrinth and cranial 
base defects between facial paralysis patients and nonfacial pa-
ralysis patients were examined using the Fisher exact test. Differ-
ences in facial canal dehiscence size between facial paralysis pa-
tients and nonfacial paralysis patients were compared using the 
Mann-Whitney U-test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered 
to be statistically significant. GraphPad InStat <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3</rs> (GraphPad Soft-</p>

<p>Cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Briefly, 
the cell lines were plated in 96-well plates (3,000 per well), 
and allowed to grow for 24, 48, and 72 hours, then assessed by 
a colorimetric assay using MTT solution (10 mg/mL) at 570 
nm. Cell invasion ability assay was performed using transwell 
invasion chambers coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences, San 
Jose, CA, USA). Cells were suspended in FBS-free medium 
and added to the upper chamber, while the medium containing 
10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After 24 hours 
of incubation, the cells remaining on the upper membrane 
were removed with cotton wool, whereas the cells that had 
invaded through the membrane were stained with metha-
nol and 0.1% crystal violet, imaged, and counted using an 
inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cell migration 
ability was assessed by performing wound healing assays. 
Cells were cultured to 100% confluence, and wounds were 
generated using pipette tips. The cells were then cultured for 
24 or 48 hours and the wound closure was assessed by Scion 
Image Software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">Scion Image Beta</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">4.03</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Scion Corporation</rs>,

data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). 
Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t-test. 
The correlation between miR-381 and Twist1 expression was 
analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. P,0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying inhibitory 
effects of miR-381 on proliferation, invasion, and migration

Using <rs type="software">TargetScan</rs> and <rs type="software">miRanda</rs> tools online, we screened 
several invasion-and migration-related genes by RTq-PCR, </p>

<p>Risk of bias was assessed using one of two approaches, 
depending on study design. For RCTs, the seven-category 
Review Manager risk of bias tool was used (RevMan ver-
sion 5.2; <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">The Cochrane Collaboration</rs>, Oxford, UK), with 
risk assessed as either high, unclear or low according 
to criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions 31 . For non-RCTs, the 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) 32 was used, in accor-
dance with previously published methodology 33 . Briefly, 
the NOS allots a maximum of nine points based on the 
representativeness of the intervention and control groups, 
ascertainment of intervention, absence of outcomes at 
study start, comparability of groups based on study design 
and analysis, blinded assessment/record linkage to confirm 
outcomes, sufficient length of follow-up and sufficiently 
low withdrawal rate. </p>

<p>all studies reported the endpoint using the same units or 
scale. Alternatively, the standardized mean difference 
(SMD), which assumes that differences in the standard 
deviation reflect differences in measurement scales, was 
used as the effect measure when different studies reported 
the same endpoint using different scales or units. 
For continuous variables not reported as mean(s.d.) 
values, these statistics were derived from the reported data 
using published methodologies or approaches outlined 
in the Cochrane Handbook 31 . For continuous variables 
reported as median (range), the mean(s.d.) values were 
calculated according to methods published by Hozo and 
colleagues 35 . Data presented as the geometric mean (95 
per cent c.i.) of log-transformed data were converted 
to mean(s.d.) on the raw scale using the methodology 
of Higgins et al. 36 . For further details, see Appendix S1 
(supporting information).

<p>The integrated chronic disease management (ICDM) model was introduced as a response to the 
dual burden of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in South Africa, one of the first 
of such efforts by an African Ministry of Health. The aim of the ICDM model is to leverage HIV pro-
gramme innovations to improve the quality of chronic disease care. There is a dearth of literature 
on the perspectives of healthcare providers and users on the quality of care in the novel ICDM 
model. This paper describes the viewpoints of operational managers and patients regarding quality 
of care in the ICDM model. 
In 2013, we conducted a case study of the seven PHC facilities in the rural Agincourt sub-district in 
northeast South Africa. Focus group discussions (n ¼ 8) were used to obtain data from 56 purpos-
ively selected patients 18 years. In-depth interviews were conducted with operational managers 
of each facility and the sub-district health manager. Donabedian's structure, process and outcome 
theory for service quality evaluation underpinned the conceptual framework in this study. 
Qualitative data were analysed, with <rs id="software-1" type="software">MAXQDA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">2</rs> software, to identify 17 a priori dimensions of 
care and unanticipated themes that emerged during the analysis. 
The manager and patient narratives showed the inadequacies in structure (malfunctioning blood 
pressure machines and staff shortage); process (irregular prepacking of drugs); and outcome (long 
waiting times). There was discordance between managers and patients regarding reasons for long 
patient waiting time which managers attributed to staff shortage and missed appointments, while 
patients ascribed it to late arrival of managers to the clinics. Patients reported anti-hypertension 
drug stock-outs (structure); sub-optimal defaulter-tracing (process); rigid clinic appointment system 
(process). Emerging themes showed that patients reported HIV stigmatisation in the community 
due to defaulter-tracing activities of home-based carers, while managers reported treatment of </p>

<p>The transcribed FGDs and interviews were thematically analysed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">MAXQDA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">2</rs> software. A combined deductive and inductive 
approach was used for data analysis. The deductive analysis was 
based on the pre-identified themes focusing on the in-depth inquiry 
of the dimensions of care in the ICDM model. Inductive analysis 
was undertaken for an emerging theme that was not anticipated at 
the outset and not included among the 17 dimensions of care cov-
ered in the topic guide. The data were coded by S.A. and verified by 
the co-authors through the reading and re-reading of the quotes. 
A code book was developed based on recurring pre-identified 
themes and emerging themes. Reliability of the coded data was veri-
fied through discussions of inconsistent codes among co-authors 
until agreement was reached. </p>

<p>Cell lines and culture conditions. A human tongue squamous 
cell carcinoma cell line, SAS, was obtained from the Health 
Science Research Resources Bank (Sendai, Japan) and main-
tained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) contain-
ing a high concentration of glucose (4500 mg/L) with 100 units/ 
mL penicillin and 100 lg/mL streptomycin, supplemented with 
10% FBS, at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. 
Establishment of SAS-Fucci cells. Fucci plasmids (CFII-EF-
mKO2-hCdt1 [30/120]) and CFII-EF-mAG-hGeminin [1/110]) 
were provided by the Riken Bio-Resource Center through the 
National Bio-Resource Project of the Ministry of Education, 
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan. Packaging 
plasmids (pLV-IVSV-G and pLV-HELP) (LENTI-Smart; Invi-
voGen, San Diego, CA, USA) and Fucci plasmids were trans-
fected into 293T cells (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). 
Supernatants were added to SAS cells, which were then cul-
tured in serum-free medium for 72 h in the presence of 8 lg/ 
mL infection reagent, Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). To purify 
double-transduced cells, green fluorescent cells were first iso-
lated using a MoFlo XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, 
CA, USA) at ice-cold temperature. One week after the first 
cell-sorting procedure, red fluorescent cells were isolated. After 
the two-step sorting, six clones were isolated, and one clone 
showing strong fluorescence in both colors was designated as 
SAS-Fucci cells. This experiment was approved by Genetically 
Modified Organisms Safety Committee of Tokyo Medical and 
Dental University (2012-006C3). 
Time-lapse imaging. Time-lapse images of monolayer cells 
were acquired at 1-h intervals for 72 h on a BIOREVO BZ-9000 
fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Images of 
spheroids were acquired at 1-h intervals for 72 h using an 
FV10i-LIV confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, 
Tokyo, Japan) in an agar-spread culture dish containing growth 
medium. During imaging, cells and spheroids were kept at 37°C 
in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO 2 . For 
quantitative analysis, fluorescent areas were measured using the

Flow cytometry analysis. All samples were fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde to detect DNA contents and the fluorescence 
intensity of monomeric Azami Green (mAG) or monomeric 
Kusabira Orange 2 (mKO2). After washing in PBS, cells were 
stained with PBS containing 10 lg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min. Samples were analyzed </p>

<p>Motivation: Cell tracking is an important method to quantitatively 
analyze time-lapse microscopy data. While numerous methods and 
tools exist for tracking cells in 2D time-lapse images, only few and 
very application-specific tracking tools are available for 3D time-
lapse images, which is of high relevance in immunoimaging, in 
particular for studying the motility of microglia in vivo. 
Results: We introduce a novel algorithm for tracking cells in 3D 
time-lapse microscopy data, based on computing cosegmentations 
between component trees representing individual time frames using 
the so-called tree-assignments. For the first time, our method 
allows to track microglia in three dimensional confocal time-lapse 
microscopy images. We also evaluate our method on synthetically 
generated data, demonstrating that our algorithm is robust even in 
the presence of different types of inhomogeneous background noise. 
<rs id="software-20" type="software">ct3d</rs><rs corresp="#software-20" type="url">http://www.picb.ac.cn/patterns/Software/ct3d</rs>Capturing the motility of cells using time-lapse microscopy has 
become an important approach to understanding processes such 
as the cell cycle (Harder et al., 2009), neuronal division and 
migration (Norden et al., 2009), immune response (Cahalan and 
Parker, 2008) or the development of cancer (Ianzini et al., 2009). 
Based on phase-contrast, confocal or two-photon microscopy, such 
live cell imaging protocols are now commonly established and 
corresponding equipment is commonly available. This has triggered 
the need for computational methods to quantitatively analyze time-
lapse microscopy data. In this context, identifying individual cells 
and tracking their identities over time is one of the basic ingredients 
for computational analysis. Hence, cell tracking algorithms have </p>

While the red cell remains in resting state, the green cell is activated through

animation of the same data. </p>

<p>is based on comparing histograms. On the contrary, our approach is 
morphological in the sense that it attempts to identify overlapping 
regions in two images by finding an optimal tree assignment. 
Using cosegmentation has potential further applications in 
location proteomics beyond the cell tracking problem investigated 
in this article. Tree assignments as a generalization of bipartite 
matchings were introduced and applied by the last author 
recently (Mosig et al., 2009), and were recently shown to 
be computationally hard in general (Canzar, Elbassioni and 
Klau, personal communication, 2010). Applying tree assignments 
to component trees for obtaining cosegmentations is a novel 
contribution in this work. In fact, cosegmentations promise to 
be useful in other bioimaging (and eventually image processing) 
applications beyond cell tracking. One straightforward application 
where cosegmentation is of high relevance are protein colocalization 
studies. Studying colocalization has recently become of relevance 
through the availability of corresponding two-or multi-label 
fluorescence microscopy (Schubert et al., 2006; Zinchuk and 
Zinchuk, 2008) or in situ hybridization (Boettiger and Levine, 2009; 
Carson et al., 2009) techniques. 
We implemented our algorithm in the publicly available <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> 
software package, which is accompanied by the <rs type="software">at3d</rs> graphical 
user interface. In terms of applying our algorithm, this article 
focuses on evaluating the performance of our cosegmentation-based 
approach for 3D cell tracking, leaving colocalization studies as a 
future direction. Cell tracking performance is evaluated both on 
two-photon live cell imaging data displaying zebrafish microglia 
in vivo, and on synthetically generated data that allow to determine 
the algorithm's accuracy based on the ground truth the synthetic data 
were generated from. </p>

<p>This score is also known as the Jaccard-Index or the Tanimoto Score. An 
important observation is that these weights are restricted to the interval [0,1]. 
For the solution of the tree assignment, this means that in a sense also the 
number of segments identified will be maximized. For weighting schemes 
yielding unbounded values over the real numbers, large and very highly 
scored segments might 'overshadow' many small good assignments in the 
solution. 
For computing all weights between any pair of vertices in two given trees, 
we implemented a fast algorithm utilizing the fact that 0-weighted vertex 
pairs do not require a variable in the linear program, along with the property 
that ω a,b = 0 implies ω a ,b = 0 for all descendants a of a and b of b. This 
leads to a speedup of an order of magnitude compared to a naive way of 
computing all pairwise weights. 
Turning 
tree 
assignments 
into 
cosegmentations: 
assume 
A ={(a 1 ,b 1 ),...,(a K ,b K )} is a tree assignment between the component trees 
of two images I and J. Then, the areas γ(a 1 ),...,γ(a K ) refer to pairwise 
disjoint segments in I, and can hence be considered as a segmentation of 
I. Correspondingly, the areas δ(b 1 ),...,δ(b K ) induce a segmentation of J; 
note that the segments γ(a i ) and δ(b j ) necessarily overlap, as they require a 
non-zero weight to be included in an optimal tree-assignment. 
Consensus segmentation and bipartite matching: when determining a 
segmentation of frame i, we are confronted with two competing options; 
one segmentation P i resulting from the cosegmentation of frames i−1 and i, 
the other one, Q i , from the cosegmentation of frames i and i+1. We resolve 
this by computing a consensus segmentation. We generally use P i as the 
starting point of a consensus segmentation. Any segment in Q i that does not 
overlap with any segment P i is supplement to P i to obtain the consensus 
segmentation P i . This ensures that cells entering the scene in frame i can be 
identified in frame i (rather than frame i+1). 
Filtering results: as for most segmentation and tracking approaches, the 
results obtained from the steps described above has a tendency toward 
overdetection, i.e. detecting segments that result from image noise rather than 
cells. To filter out those segments, we utilize life span filtering, i.e. we filter 
out all cells whose identity can be traced across less than a certain minimum 
number of frames. This cell filter, along with several other ways to eliminate 
cells with unsuitable size or volume features, follows corresponding features 
of the <rs type="software">Celltrack</rs> software (Sacan et al., 2008) for 2D cell tracking; for 
<rs type="software">ct3d</rs>, they are implemented in the graphical user interface of the <rs type="software">at3d</rs> tool 
shown in Figure 4. </p>

<p>Fig. 4. Screenshot of <rs type="software">at3d</rs>, which is designed for exploring cell tracking 
results and extracting motility parameters. It also supports features for 
correcting overdetection and oversegmentation. Cells can be selected and 
removed either individually or by filtering based on different criteria such as 
size or life span. </p>

<p>• Alternative matching schemes: one class of cell tracking approaches 
is based on computing bipartite matchings between segmentations of 
individual time frames. As bipartite matchings may not capture events 
such as cell division or cell fusion, recent works such as Padfield et al. 
(2009) introduced alternative matching schemes that are more flexible. 
Truly generalizing bipartite matchings, tree assignments can be seen 
as such alternative matching scheme. They are particularly interesting 
for cell tracking, as they may capture events such as cell division, 
cell fusion or cells entering the scene. See Supplementary Video 4 
for synthetic data displaying a simplistic simulation of a cell division 
tracked by <rs type="software">ct3d</rs>. </p>

<p>We implemented component trees, tree-assignments and the complete cell 
tracking algorithm, in <rs type="software">C++</rs> using lp_solve 1 for solving both the tree 
assignment and the weighted bipartite matching (integer) linear programs, 
all of which is compiled in the <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> command line tool. Cell tracking 
results can be further explored using <rs type="software">at3d</rs>, which allows the user to select 
and extract specific cells identified by the cell tracking procedure, and derive 
their motility parameters such as velocity and deformation. The <rs type="software">at3d</rs> tool is 
implemented using the <rs type="software">qt</rs> framework for graphical user interfaces. Input and 
output of image series is designed to be compatible with other visualization 
software, most notably <rs id="software-74" type="software">v3d</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-74" type="creator">Peng et al.</rs>., 2010) for producing rendered 
visualizations of the output. </p>

<p>We evaluated our algorithm on two types of data. First, we applied 
it to an in vivo time-lapse sequence of 3D two-photon images of 
zebrafish midbrain, displaying the motility of microglia; second, we 
applied <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> to synthetically generated data for quantifying the 
accuracy of our cell tracking results. 
Evalutation on in vivo data was accomplished by comparison 
with manually annotated trajectories of specific microglia in three 
datasets. Note that manual annotation is limited to trajectories, 
whereas boundaries of the cell volumes are almost impossible to 
obtain in 3D, beside systematic problems with manual annotations 
(Huth et al., 2010). Hence, we additionally created synthetic ground 
truth data to further evaluate the performance of our method. We 
followed the procedure used in Dufour et al. (2005), generating 
(noise perturbed) elliptical objects of average intensity I o above 
Poisson distributed background noise of intensity I b . In addition 
to the procedure from Dufour et al. (2005), we created perturbed 
images with different types of background inhomogeneities, as 
shown in Figure 5: in a second set of data, we introduced a 
multiplicative vignetting effect to the data, following the vignetting 
model by Kang and Weiss (2000) under different focal lengths f 
and off-axis illumination parameters α. In a third set of data, we 
introduced an additive linear gradient along the x-axis of different 
slopes β. Each time series consists of 20 time frames, each of size 
200×200×40 pixels. On these data, we ran <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> with size cutoffs 
θ min = 500 and θ max = 5000, and a single-node cutoff of 200 pixels. 
In the resulting sequences, all cells whose identity could be traced 
through the complete sequence were kept, while all other cells were 
discarded using the <rs type="software">at3d</rs> tool. </p>

<p>Our results on the synthetically generated image sequences 
are summarized in Table 1 and indicate that <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> is highly 
robust against different types and intensities of background 
inhomogeneities. The results suggest that <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> has a tendency 
to identify components slightly (about 10%) larger than the actual 
objects, as can also be seen in the sample output in Supplementary 
Video 3. This is a natural consequence of pruning the component 
trees, where the vertex that would perfectly represent an object is 
unlikely to be part of the pruned tree. This effect can be reduced by 
smaller choice for the single-node cutoff parameter σ at the cost of 
higher computation time. 
Running times varied between roughly 4 and 6 min, with an 
average of 303.42 s, for completely tracking one dataset. The </p>

<p>Fig. 5. Sections of synthetically generated images-Left: 2D section (top) of 
an image perturbed background vignetting following the Kang-Weiss model 
(Kang and Weiss, 2000). The dashed box indicates the position of the 1D 
section displayed in the lower part. Right: same setting with the background 
perturbed by an additive linear gradient. In both instances, <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> yields 
reliable tracking results (see Table 1). </p>

<p>majority of running time was spent on constructing the component 
trees and computing the overlap weights (14.23 s on average per 
time frame), whereas each tree assignment required less than one 
second on average; the pruned component trees typically comprised 
a few dozens of vertices. 
As a reference algorithm to compare against the performance of 
<rs type="software">ct3d</rs>, we computed a segmentation of each time frame using the 
active contour approach by Chan and Vese (2001), 
2 which is a well-
established and state-of-the-art representative of the large family of 
level set methods. As shown in Table 1, this method works highly 
accurate in the absence of background inhomogeneity while getting 
less reliable with increasing levels of background inhomogeneity, 
as can be expected due to the involvement of a global background 
model. </p>

<p>Figure 6 shows a result obtained from our tracking algorithm on a 
time series of microglia images measured as described above. We 
reduced resolution by half, so that the resulting width and height 
varied between 146 and 250 pixels, while the depth ranged between 
14 and 66 layers for each time frame; each time series comprised 
30-80 time frames. Gray scale resolution was reduced from 16 bit 
to 8 bit. We applied <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> using parameters θ min = 200, θ max = 
10 000 and a single-node cutoff of 200 pixels; the resulting pruned 
component trees contained 69 vertices on average, ranging between 
40 and 168 vertices. Running times varied between roughly 2 and 
10 min, with 471 s on average. 
Under the given experimental protocol, the phenomenon of 
overdetection, i.e. the recognition of segments that are not microglia, 
is inevitable. This is due to the limited specificity of the apoE-
GFP gene, which is also expressed in cells other than microglia 
in the surrounding tissue, often at comparably high levels as in 
microglia. Yet, <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> identifies microglia as segments that can be 
visually distinguished from non-microglia segments by a human 
observer due to their characteristic shape or motion patterns. The </p>

<p>To assess the quality of tracking results, we derived the number of identified cells, the voxel recall, i.e. what percentage of all ground truth object voxels was recovered in the 
tracking result, as well as the error rate defined as the ratio between the cardinality of the symmetric difference between tracking result and ground truth and the total number 
of voxels in the ground truth dataset. Left columns: each dataset displayed three cells with different intensities I o above different levels of noise I b , displaying different types of 
background inhomogeneities (see text). Middle columns: the three cells were correctly recovered under all settings by <rs type="software">ct3d</rs>. Right columns: segmentation using the active contour 
approach by Chan and Vese (2001) is highly reliable in the absence of background inhomogeneity. With increasing level of inhomogeneity, voxel recall decreases, while the error 
rate increases. Supplementary Figure 1 displays some of the results summarized here. </p>

<p>graphical user interface of the at3d tool (see Fig. 4) allows to 
manually eliminate false positive cells from tracking results by 
different filtering and visual selection functions similar to those 
provided by <rs type="software">Celltrack</rs> for 2D time-lapse sequences. The at3d 
tool also allows to manually correct for the occasionally observed 
events of oversegmentation, i.e. one microglia being recognized as 
two segments. 
We used <rs type="software">at3d</rs> to eliminate non-microglia from all six datasets 
and correct oversegmentation in individual frames. We were able to 
reconstruct trajectories of all relevant microglia that can be visually 
identified in the original datasets; only one dataset was affected by 
a sudden 'frameshift', i.e. the sample changing its distance to the 
camera in the z direction, leading to interrupted trajectories at the 
corresponding time frame. In few other cases, the trajectory of a 
microglia was interrupted in individual frames, which we could 
correct using <rs type="software">at3d</rs>. Examples of the final results are given in 
Supplementary Videos 1 and 2. 
In order to quantitatively evaluate the quality of <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> results 
on in vivo microglia data, we compared <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> trajectories with 
manual annotations. To this end, we selected four microglia from 
four different datasets and annotated their trajectories manually 
using the 3D polyline markup feature of the <rs type="software">v3d</rs> software. The root 
mean square distance between the <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> and the manual trajectories 
turned out to be 2.9 voxels, 5.5 voxels, 2.6 voxels and 5.4 voxels, 
respectively, in the four different datasets. These deviations can be 
considered relatively small in relation to the cell diameters, which 
were measured as 22.8, 22, 19.6 and 44.3 voxels, respectively. 
We also applied the active-contour approach from Chan and Vese 
(2001) to the datasets. Identifying the the four microglia in our 
annotated evaluation dataset required intensive tuning of the four 
major parameters. In fact, we could not identify a single set of 
parameters that works across all datasets. A parameter set tuned 
for a specific dataset worked comparably well on the respective </p>

<p>We have presented a novel approach to tracking cells in 3D 
time-lapse microscopy image sequences, based on the concepts 
of component trees and cosegmentation. We demonstrate that this 
approach is robust against the numerous challenges imposed by 
images measured in an in vivo environment, and allows to identify 
microglia and their motion patterns in zebrafish neural tissue 
when combined with the <rs type="software">at3d</rs> annotation tool. In a quantitative 
evaluation, we show that our approach is robust against different 
types of background inhomogeneities. This suggests that <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> and 
<rs type="software">at3d</rs> are potentially useful for in vivo imaging studies investigating 
other aspects than just microglia motility. In its current formulation, 
our cosegmentation approach relies on the assumption that the area 
occupied by an object overlaps between two consecutive time points. 
While this may not be satisfied in all cell tracking problems [e.g. 
when tracking centrosomes (Jaensch et al., 2010)], it is a reasonable 
assumption for many immunoimaging-related studies. 
To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that 
can identify and track microglia in live cell imaging time series. 
In most cases, obtaining reliable trajectories still requires manual 
post-processing of the output. The most notorious difficulties 
certainly are the complex morphology-their deformation patterns, 
irregular shapes and interaction with the surrounding-as well as 
the unspecificity of the fluorescent markers available. In this light, 
our approach constitutes significant progress in the sense that it has 
sufficient sensitivity to separate microglia form their surrounding. 
Yet, a fully automated approach remains a major and certainly 
non-trivial challenge. A first step in this direction might be the 
combination with level-set based approaches as utilized for 2D cell </p>

<p>Fig. 6. Top: visualization of trajectories obtained by manual annotation (blue 
lines) with trajectories obtained using <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> (orange lines) for microglia in 
activated state, see (a) and (b), as well as resting state, see (c) and (d). 
Bottom: quantitative comparison of trajectories obtained by <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> and the 
active contour approach from Chan and Vese (2001). In general, <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> could 
identify the annotated cells in all time frames (columns # Frames). The 
root mean square distance to the annotated trajectory measures a fraction 
of the diameter of the annotated cell (columns cell and RMS), while the 
Chan-Vese algorithm missed varying numbers of cells or failed completely 
(last column). For the Chan-Vese results, a parameter set was optimized for 
dataset (a). This parameter set (µ = 1, ν = .5, λ 1 = .2, λ 2 = 5) was also applied 
to datasets (b) to (d). While for dataset (a), the result is comparable to <rs type="software">ct3d</rs>, 
the annotated cell was identified in only 29 out of 49 time frames in (b). In 
datasets (c) and (d), the annotated cell could not be identified at all using 
these parameters. See Supplementary Figure S2 for further illustrations. </p>

<p>tracking by Nath et al. (2006) that might yield more accurate cell 
boundaries in some cases. Yet, <rs type="software">ct3d</rs> promises to be a key tool 
for further studying open questions regarding microglia, such as to 
determine if and how glia and microglia share the task of finding 
and removing apoptotic neurons from the vertebrate brain (Peri and 
Nüsslein-Volhard, 2008). 
Beside the direct relevance for in vivo time-lapse microscopy, our 
study indicates that our morphological approach to cosegmentation 
is both practical and of relevance in bioimaging. Consequentially, 
it appears a natural approach to apply cosegmentation to protein 
colocalization studies, which have attracted considerable attention </p>

<p>Study Protocol 
In EM residency program, all residents evaluate each 
of their rotations. We obtained data for this study using 
an Internet-based electronic evaluation tool, <rs type="software">E*Value</rs> 
(Minneapolis, Minnesota), which solicits and collects resident 
evaluations every 4 weeks. Data were de-identified and 
examined in aggregate so as to not attribute any evaluation 
score to an individual. 
The new team-based staffing model was implemented on 
June 24, 2012, the beginning of an academic year. Evaluations 
submitted by residents rotating in the ED between November 
14, 2011, and June 23, 2012, were considered pre-intervention 
evaluations. Residents are assigned to the ED on 4-week block 
rotations; a total of eight 4-week blocks were included in the 
pre-intervention period. Three 4-week block rotations (June 24 
to September 16, 2012) following institution of the new staffing 
model were considered a washout period to minimize effects 
introduced by staff members' adjustment to the change and the 
"July phenomenon," the tendency toward increased errors and 
decreased hospital efficiency at teaching hospitals at the start 
of the academic year. 
6 Evaluations completed during the eight 
4-week blocks between September 17, 2012, and April 28, 
2013, were considered the post-intervention group. 
Additionally, we determined the number of patients seen 
by each resident in the pre-intervention and post-intervention 
periods using a reporting function available through the study 
site's electronic patient tracking system <rs id="software-1" type="software">FirstNet</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Cerner</rs>, 
North Kansas City, Missouri). Resident work hours were 
retrieved via an electronic physician shift scheduling software

<p>intervention and post-intervention. The mean Likert scale 
scores for evaluations completed by the residents and PPH 
were calculated. We determined mean differences and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between both 
periods among all residents using paired sample t-tests. 
<rs id="software-4" type="software">Statistician</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">xlQA</rs>, Melbourne, Australia) was used for

<p>Figure 2 | Experimental set-up and timing. (a) The copper target is held at 19 K, liquefying the deuterium that is filled into the central cavity. A drive laser 
is incident on a 2-mm-diameter Al pusher, launching a shock wave along the axis. A probe laser irradiates a Si 3 N 4 foil, pumping the 2,005 eV Si Ly-a 
transition. X-rays scattered in the forward and backward directions are spectrally dispersed with highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystals whose 
direct view of the laser-plasma is prevented by Ni shields. (b) Cross section of the target reservoir across the thickness of the target. The target is sealed 
with aluminium on the front surface and a transparent quartz rear window to allow the VISAR beam to probe shock evolution. (c) Schematic of laser beam 
timing showing the shock drive beam (red) of 2-6 ns preceding a 2-ns probe pulse. The probe is delayed by 10-20 ns, depending on drive intensity, to allow 
the shock front to advance into the x-ray spectrometer view. Shorter delay times yielded higher shock pressures. (d) <rs type="software">HYDRA</rs> simulations of mass density 
evolving as a function of space and time, with a lineout at the x-ray probe time of 20 ns. The compressed D 2 peak (r Shock ¼ 0.54 g cm À 3 ) has traversed into 
the spectrometer field of view at t ¼ 20 ns when we make the x-ray measurement. The high-density peak lagging the D 2 shock front is due to the aluminium 
pusher, but is shielded by the x-ray window. </p>

<p>Figure 3 shows a VISAR streak record along with the extracted 
shock velocities for high-power laser drive conditions. Also 
shown are simulation results from <rs type="software">HYDRA</rs>, a radiation-
hydrodynamics code widely used for modelling inertial confine-
ment fusion and laser-plasma experiments 43 . <rs type="software">HYDRA</rs> accurately 
reproduces the measured late-time shock velocities when 
scattering is performed. Stray light from the drive beam is 
visible for 2 ns early in the streak. Shock breakout from the Al 
pusher into D 2 occurs near the end of the drive beam where a 
discontinuous fringe shift is visible. As the shock decays, a drop in 
signal amplitude is visible in the raw data, since reflectivity falls 
as shock pressure and ionization decrease. The peak velocity 
immediately following shock breakout from the pusher is 
22 km s À 1 with pressures near 50 GPa, which decays to 
14 ± 1 km s À 1 and 15 þ 3.5/ À 4.5 GPa at 21 ns, the centre of 
the 2-ns-long x-ray probe. </p>

<p>Figure 5 shows the 135°backscattered spectrum from another 
shot using a 4-ns laser drive, and a probe beam delay of 15 ns. 
<rs type="software">HYDRA</rs> calculations using an intensity profile matched to the 
velocity measurements shown above predict pressures of 16 GPa 
and compressions of 3.2 þ 0.2/ À 0.4, producing target conditions 
very close to those achieved in the plasmon scattering case. The 
ratio of elastic to inelastic scattering is strongly dependent on the 
ionization of the target; with increasing average ionization, 
the inelastic scattering contribution from free electrons grows 
relative to the remaining elastic signal. Fits are shown in 
Fig. 5a for ionizations Z ¼ 0.1-0.5 and a best fit is achieved for 
n e ¼ 2.4 Â 10 22 cm À 3 . This corresponds Z ¼ 0.15±0.08, in good 
agreement with the plasmon data. At these conditions, the 
scattering parameter is a ¼ 0.63. 
For non-collective scattering, the theoretical models used to 
describe the bound-free contribution can have a significant effect 
on the inelastic spectrum. In the present case where weakly bound 
electrons in the compressed deuterium occupy states near the 
continuum, continuum depression plays a particularly important 
role. To minimize any ambiguity introduced by this model 
dependence, we have compared our results, which use a Stewart-
Pyatt (SP) model 45 for ionization potential depression, with a set 
of calculations using the Eckert-Kröll (EK) 46 model. The resulting 
curves are shown in Fig. 5b, with the SP model in red and the EK 
model in blue. The contribution to the spectrum from bound-free 
scattering are shown separately as dashed curves, illustrating 
that the primary difference comes through the shift of the 
EK feature towards E 0 . We attribute this to a much higher 
value of continuum depression calculated by the EK model, 
DE EK ¼ 10.2 eV compared with DE SP ¼ 2.1 eV for SP. We note 
that in both cases a best fit is found for an ionization state 
of Z ¼ 0.15 (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 and Supplementary 
Methods). We conclude that, for very similar experimental drive 
conditions, plasmon and Compton scattering provide nearly 
identical ionization states; this is significant because the sensitivity 
of plasmon spectra and Compton scattering spectra to bound-free 
models and structure factors is very different. This finding 
indicates that contributions from bound-free scattering and 
interband transitions are accounted for by our data analysis and 
that interband transitions play a minor role in the interpretation 
of the data. </p>

<p>results showed that Na had a large effect on our 
outcomes, the same analyses were performed for 
continuous Na scores divided into quartiles. 
The course of HRQoL and disease-specific health 
status (separate models for each scale) according to 
the four personality groups was analyzed using linear 
mixed effects models (i.e. covariance pattern model 
with an unstructured error variance matrix and max-
imum likelihood estimation). This technique uses 
data efficiently by also including incomplete cases in 
the analyses. as a result of this, bias is limited and 
statistical power is preserved. Time was analyzed as 
a regular categorical predictor with three levels (i.e. 
three time points). Sex, age, time since diagnosis, 
treatment, disease stage, comorbid conditions, part-
nership and educational level and depression levels 
were entered as covariates into the models, based on 
a priori assumptions/hypotheses. Sociodemographic 
and clinical characteristics were analyzed as time-
invariant predictors (i.e. baseline characteristics were 
used). Depression scores were analyzed as continu-
ous time varying predictors. In order to correctly 
interpret all model parameters, all continuous vari-
ables have been grand-mean centered. 
Finally, a sub analyses using linear mixed-effects 
models was performed on the general subscale global 
health status/QoL over time stratified by Na divided 
into quartiles.

<p>cool until DNA was extracted from them at the genetics 
facility at the University of Colorado. 
Total genomic DNA was extracted from needle tissue 
using the hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) 
extraction procedure of Doyle &amp; Doyle (1987 ). The primers 
of Demesure et al . (1995) were used to amplify the second 
intron of nad1 from the mitochondrial genome. The poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) contained, in a 15-µ L reac-
tion volume, 50 m m KCl, 10 m m Tris-HCl, 0.01% gelatin, 
3 m m MgCl 2 , 200 µ m of each dNTP, 0.5 U of Taq poly-
merase, 200 n m of each primer and 20 ng of template 
DNA. The amplification cycle consisted of an initial 3-
min denaturation at 94 ° C followed by 45 cycles of: 1 min 
denaturation at 94 ° C, 1 min annealing and 2.5 min exten-
sion at 72 ° C, with a final 10-min extension at 72 ° C. The 
annealing temperatures employed a touchdown temper-
ature profile, with four cycles at each of a descending 
series of temperatures (63 ° C, 61 ° C, 59 ° C and 57 ° C); the 
following 39 cycles used an annealing temperature of 
55 ° C. The 2.2-kb fragment was digested with Rsa I, and 
visualized by silver staining (Klinkicht &amp; Tautz 1992) 
after electrophoresis on a 5% denaturing acrylamide gel. 
The cleaved fragments of the amplified DNA were 
assigned numbers: 1 was assigned to the smallest frag-
ment and other fragments were labelled sequentially with 
increasing size. 
Frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes were treated as allelic 
frequencies at a single locus for statistical purposes. F ST was 
used to describe the variation among populations and 
was calculated using biosys (Swofford &amp; Selander <rs corresp="#software-14" type="version-date">1981</rs>). 
The homogeneity of haplotype frequencies was tested 
using a row-by-columns test of independence, which 
employs χ 2 . Because some of the sample sites had 
small sample sizes, we grouped the samples into the 
geographical regions listed in Table 1 for the calculation 
of χ 2 . </p>

<p>2007), with a 63× oil immersion lens (NA 1.4) coupled to a microscope 
incubator, maintaining standard tissue culture conditions (Okolab), using a 
pulsed (sub-10 ps, 40 MHz) supercontinuum (430-2,000 nm) light source 
(SC 450; Fianium Ltd.). Desired excitation wavelength (typically 470 nm 
for FLIM of GFP variants and 440 nm for D1ER cameleon FRET) was tuned 
using an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTFnC-VIS; AA Opto-Electronic). 
Desired emission was collected using 510/42 and 470-490 bandpass 
filters for GFP variants and D1ER cameleon accordingly and detected by 
a fast photomultiplier tube (PMC-100; Becker &amp; Hickl GmbH). Lifetimes 
for each pixel were recorded using TCSPC circuitry (SPC-830; Becker &amp; 
Hickl GmbH), keeping count rates below 1% of the laser repetition rate 
to prevent pulse pile-up. Images were acquired over 20-60 s, with a typi-
cal flow rate of 5 × 10 
4 photons sec 
1 , while detector speed saturation 
(pile-up effect) is not observed below 10 
6 photons sec 
1 in this instru-
ment. The data were processed using <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPCImage</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Becker &amp; Hickl GmbH</rs>) 
fitting the time-correlated photon count data obtained for each pixel of 
the image to a monoexponential decay function, yielding a value for life-
time on the picosecond scale. 
After filtering out autofluorescence (by excluding pixels with a fluor-
escence lifetime that was out of range of the roGFP probes, i.e., longer than 
2,800 ps), mean fluorescence lifetime of single cells or beads was estab-
lished. The value obtained represented the redox as sensed by roGFPiE in 
vivo/in vitro or FRET efficiency of D1ER cameleon (inversely proportional 
to Ca 
2+ concentration). Each data point is constituted by the average and 
SD of measurements from at least 10 cells or beads. Unless indicated oth-
erwise, the images shown are of a representative experiment reproduced 
at least twice. </p>

<p>We have developed <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs>, a program to con-
struct multiple protein sequence alignment using 
probabilistic consistency. <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> improves 
alignment quality by using pairwise alignment 
hidden Markov models (HMMs) with multiple match 
states that describe local structural information 
without exploiting explicit structure predictions. 
Parameters for such models have been estimated 
from a large library of structure-based alignments. 
We show that (i) on remote homologs, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> 
achieves statistically best accuracy among several 
leading aligners, such as <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> and 
<rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs>, albeit the average improvement is small, 
in the order of several percent; (ii) a large collection 
(.10 000) of automatically computed pairwise struc-
ture alignments of divergent protein domains is 
superior to smaller but carefully curated datasets 
for estimation of alignment parameters and perfor-
mance tests; (iii) reference-independent evaluation 
of alignment quality using sequence alignment-
dependent structure superpositions correlates well 
with reference-dependent evaluation that compares 
sequence-based alignments to structure-based 
reference alignments. </p>

<p>Valuable information regarding position-specific residue 
usage and conservation can be extracted numerically from a 
multiple sequence alignment for various applications. 
A classical method for constructing a multiple alignment 
aligns sequences progressively, as exemplified by the program 
<rs type="software">ClustalW</rs> (7). Guided by a tree or a dendrogram that reflects 
the similarities among sequences, a progressive method 
makes a series of pairwise alignments for neighboring seq-
uences or pre-aligned sequence groups. In this way, similar 
sequences are aligned prior to divergent sequences. However, 
progressive methods do not correct errors made in each pair-
wise alignment step. While similar sequences can be aligned 
with acceptable quality, progressive methods using general 
amino acid substitution matrices have limited success in obtain-
ing high-quality alignments for divergent sequences (8). 
Two main techniques are utilized to correct or minimize 
mistakes made in the progressive alignment process. One is 
iterative refinement of the alignment after the progressive 
steps (9-11), e.g. by repeatedly dividing the aligned sequences 
into two groups and realigning the groups. The other tech-
nique, pioneered by the program <rs type="software">T-COFFEE</rs> (12), makes 
a consistency measure among a set of pairwise sequence 
alignments before the progressive alignment steps. Such 
consistency-based scoring functions are superior to scoring 
functions based on general amino acid substitution 
matrices (12). 
Improving pairwise sequence alignments is a key to 
provide high-quality starting materials for a consistency 
measure. The most common technique of constructing a 
protein pairwise alignment utilizes a substitution matrix of 
amino acids and a dynamic programming algorithm with 
gap penalties (13,14). Commonly used substitution matrices, 
such as the BLOSUM or PAM series matrices (15,16) 
are derived from large-scale analysis of relatively similar 
sequences. Other matrices have been derived from distant 
homologs based on structural alignments (17,18), and they 
are more suitable for aligning divergent sequences. Several 
studies have also shown that real or predicted local structural 
information can be used to improve pairwise alignment 
quality (19,20). </p>

<p>Another approach to constructing a pairwise alignment 
relies on a hidden Markov model (HMM) (21,22). In a simple 
HMM for global pairwise alignment, aligned residue pairs 
are modeled by a hidden match state, while insertions and 
deletions are modeled by two hidden states that generate 
unmatched residues in either of the two sequences (22). In 
addition to being able to find an optimal alignment, a pairwise 
alignment HMM can be used to estimate the posterior pro-
bability of any residue in the first sequence being aligned 
to any residue in the second sequence (22). These residue 
match probabilities have been used in <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> (23), a 
multiple sequence alignment program based on probabilistic 
consistency. 
In this study, we aim to improve alignment quality 
by using: (i) more complex pairwise alignment HMMs that 
incorporate local structural information and (ii) better 
estimation of HMM parameters from a large set of structural 
alignments of divergent domain pairs from SCOP database 
(24). We show that these two techniques improve both 
pairwise alignments and probabilistic consistency-based 
multiple sequence alignments in reference-dependent and 
reference-independent tests. </p>

<p>alignment using the program <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> (26). Alignments with 
coverage (fraction of aligned region to the length of the 
shorter sequence) less than 0.6 were removed. The remaining 
alignments were divided into four datasets corresponding 
to four sequence identity bins: &lt;10, 10-15, 15-20 and 
20-40%. The method for calculating sequence identity that 
takes into account unaligned regions is described in 
Supplementary Data. To apply cross validation training and 
testing, we divided the domain pairs in each identity bin 
into four subsets at the SCOP fold level, so that no domains 
belonging to the same SCOP fold were shared by any two 
subsets. We estimated HMM parameters using alignments 
in three subsets and tested the programs on representative 
domain pairs of the remaining fourth subset. This procedure 
was performed four times corresponding to four ways of 
partitioning into training and testing datasets. To obtain 
representative alignments from a subset for testing, we 
randomly selected one domain pair from each SCOP fold 
in that subset. The number of domain pairs in each training 
dataset is larger than 10 000 (Supplementary Table S1). </p>

<p>Description of HMM structures. The standard pairwise 
alignment HMM has three hidden states emitting residues: 
a single match state 'M' emitting residue pairs, an 'X' state 
emitting residues in the first sequence and a 'Y' state emitting 
residues in the second sequence (Figure 1b) (22). This model 
structure is named HMM_1_1_0 (the format of HMM names 
is described below and in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). 
The novelty of our complex HMMs is the introduction of 
more match states based on <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> structural alignments, 
which have aligned core blocks (structurally superimposable, 
shown in uppercase letters) and unaligned regions (struc-
turally not superimposable, shown in lowercase letters) </p>

<p>(Figure 1a). Residue pairs in aligned core blocks can be 
modeled by a match state ('M'). If the two unaligned regions 
in between two core blocks have different and non-zero 
lengths, they can be modeled using a different 'match' state 
('U', for unaligned) (Figure 1c) and 'X' or 'Y' state. This 
is done by evenly splitting the unaligned residues in the 
sequence with the shorter unaligned region into two 
segments, placing them beside the two adjacent core blocks 
and separating them by a single stretch of gap symbols. In 
this way, transitions between 'X' and 'Y' do not occur. 
The residue pair emission probabilities of these artificially 
forced matches in unaligned regions ('U') are expected 
to be different from those in the core blocks ('M'). This 
model (HMM_1_1_1) has two distinct match states: 'M' 
and 'U' (Figure 1a and c). 
Furthermore, the residue matches in aligned core blocks 
can be modeled by several distinct match states based on 
the local structure information of the first sequence, for 
instance, secondary structure types (Figure 1d). Since residue 
usage and substitution patterns can vary for different local 
structural environments, the three match states according to 
secondary structure types have different sets of emission 
probabilities of 400 residue pairs. Secondary structure types 
were assigned using program <rs type="software">DSSP</rs> (27) for SCOP domains. 
The model that incorporates three secondary structure types 
('H': helix, 'S': strand and 'C': coil) of the first sequence 
and unaligned match state ('U') is named HMM_1_3_1 
(Figure 1d). Similarly, multiple match states can be intro-
duced based on several solvent accessibility categories, or a 
combination of solvent accessibility categories and secondary 
structure types. Solvent accessibilities of residue sidechains 
were calculated by program <rs type="software">NACCESS</rs> (28). Three solvent 
accessibility categories were used based on our previous 
studies (29). The model that incorporates three solvent 
accessibility categories and unaligned match state is named 
HMM_3_1_1. Combination of three solvent accessibility 
categories and three secondary structure types results in 
nine classes of match states for the core blocks (model 
HMM_3_3_1). 
Each HMM model is named in the format 
'HMM_solv_ss_u', where 'solv' is the number of solvent 
accessibility categories, 'ss' is the number of secondary 
structure types, and 'u' is 1 if unaligned regions are modeled 
with an additional match state. Some statistics about the five 
HMMs, such as the number of hidden states, the number of 
parameters and time complexity, are listed in Supplementary 
Table S2. </p>

<p>folds. The parameters were estimated from weighted 
counts of observed transitions and emissions in <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> 
alignments (22). 
The supervised learning method was also used to estimate 
model parameters from pairwise alignments in BAliBASE2.0 
(30), from which <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> derived its HMM parameters 
with a different approach (23). These alignments also have 
core blocks assigned (uppercase letters). However, local 
structural information is not available for every sequence. 
Therefore, from BAliBASE2.0 pairwise alignments, we 
derived parameters only for models HMM_1_1_0 and 
HMM_1_1_1 that do not have local structure-dependent 
match states. </p>

<p>We have developed a progressive multiple sequence align-
ment program implementing our HMMs (<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs>, 
standing for MUltiple alignment with Multiple MAtch state 
models of Local Structure). It applies a probabilistic consis-
tency scoring function similar to the one in <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> (23). 
First, a tree is built-in a fast way based on a k-mer count 
method (10). An initial alignment is built progressively 
guided by the tree with a simple sum-of-pairs scoring func-
tion. A second tree is then built with a UPGMA method 
based on sequence identities calculated from the initial 
alignment. We then apply the probabilistic consistency stra-
tegy as described by Do et al. (23). For each sequence pair, 
we calculate the match probabilities of residue pairs using 
one of the HMMs. These probability matrices are subject to 
consistency measure, which involves multiplications of the 
matrices (23). Finally, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> progressively aligns the 
sequences guided by the second tree using the consistency-
based scoring function. 
To properly balance alignment speed and accuracy, we 
have also applied a two-stage alignment strategy similar to 
the one used in our program <rs type="software">PCMA</rs> (32). In the first stage, 
highly similar sequences are progressively aligned in a fast 
way without consistency scoring. The scoring function in 
this stage is a weighted sum-of-pairs measure of BLOSUM62 
scores (16). If two neighboring groups on a tree have an 
average sequence identity higher than a certain threshold, 
they are aligned in this fast way. The result of the first 
stage is a set of pre-aligned groups that are relatively diver-
gent from each other. In the second alignment stage, one 
representative sequence is selected from each pre-aligned 
group, and these representative sequences are subject to the 
more time-consuming probabilistic consistency measure. 
Then the representatives are aligned progressively according 
to the consistency-based scoring function. Finally, the pre-
aligned groups obtained in the first stage are merged accord-
ing to the alignment of the representatives to obtain the final 
alignment of all sequences. </p>

<p>To test multiple sequence alignment programs, we used the 
same representative SCOP pairs selected for pairwise align-
ment tests (Supplementary Table S1). For each domain, we 
added up to 24 homologs, which were obtained from PSI-
BLAST searches (1) with five iterations and an E-value 
cut-off of 0.0001. We removed highly similar sequences 
(&gt;97% identity) and sequence fragments (coverage less 
than half of the query) before randomly selecting up to 24 
homologs. This procedure is similar to the one used to 
build the PREFAB database (10). Similar to pairwise align-
ment tests, the 4-fold cross validation approach is applied 
to the tests of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs>. 
Two large testing datasets compiled by other researchers 
were used as well. One is the SABmark database (version 
1.65) (33), which is based on homologous SCOP domains, 
and the other is PREFAB database (version 4) (10), which 
is based on structural alignments and homologous sequences 
from database searches. Alignment quality scores (Q-scores) 
were calculated using the built-in programs in SABmark and </p>

<p>PREFAB packages. The Q-score is the fraction of the number 
of correctly aligned residue pairs in the test alignment to the 
total number of aligned residue pairs in the reference align-
ment. Additional series of smaller datasets constructed by 
<rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> authors (11) were 55 HOMSTRAD (34) structural 
alignments with various numbers of close homologs added 
('HOM + X', 'X' is the number of close homologs added 
and is 0, 20, 50 or 100). To obtain more balanced datasets 
from 'HOM + 100', we used <rs type="software">BLASTCLUST</rs> to cluster 
sequences in any 'HOM + 100' alignment at 50 or 60% iden-
tity level, and selected up to two homologs in each sequence 
cluster. The resulting datasets are called 'HOM + 100_bcl50' 
and 'HOM + 100_bcl60'. We also tested programs on 218 
BAliBASE3.0 (35) alignments with full-length sequences. 
The column scores (the fraction of entirely correct columns) 
were reported in addition to Q-scores for BAliBASE3.0. 
Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were performed to calculate 
statistical significance of comparisons between alignment 
programs, which include <rs id="software-124" type="software">ProbCons</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-124" type="version-number">version 1.10</rs>) (23), 
<rs id="software-125" type="software">MAFFT</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-125" type="version-number">version 5.667</rs>) (11) with several options, <rs id="software-126" type="software">MUSCLE</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-126" type="version-number">version 3.52</rs>) (10) and <rs id="software-127" type="software">ClustalW</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-127" type="version-number">version 1.83</rs>) (7). 
In addition to Q-score, we utilized a reference-independent 
assessment of alignment quality from a structural modeling 
perspective. Given a test sequence alignment of two SCOP 
domains with known structures, corresponding Ca atoms in 
aligned residue pairs were used as equivalent points for struc-
tural superposition to minimize the root mean square distance 
(RMSD). The structural similarity scores were calculated 
based on this forced superposition of the aligned residue 
pairs. The following scores were used: DALI Z-score (36), 
GDT score (37), TM-score (38), 3D-score (39) and two 
LiveBench contact scores (39) (see Supplementary Data for 
the equations of 3D-score and LiveBench contact scores). 
An alignment with better quality should have a higher 
similarity of the two structures superimposed in a sequence-
dependent way described above, and thus have a larger struc-
tural score. Two reference-independent sequence similarity 
scores were also calculated for aligned residue pairs in a 
test alignment: sequence identity and average BLOSUM62 
scores (16). Additionally, each of the scores was rescaled to 
take into account a random model (the reversed alignment), 
self-comparisons and alignment coverage (see Supplementary 
Data for details). Such rescaling places each score between 0 
(random match) and 1 (self-match) and makes different 
scoring schemes more comparable to each other. </p>

<p>model with a single match state (Figure 1a). It can serve as a 
control for more complex models, including HMM_1_1_1 
that assigns residue pairs in unaligned regions to a different 
match state, HMM_1_3_1 that captures secondary structure 
information, HMM_3_1_1 that captures solvent accessibility 
information, and HMM_3_3_1 that has both types of local 
structural information (see Materials and Methods). 
Several conclusions can be drawn from Table 1 and 
Supplementary Table S3. (i) For each testing dataset, the 
best performance is usually achieved with parameters esti-
mated on the training dataset with the same identity range 
(Supplementary Table S3). For example, models trained on 
alignments with the highest identity range (20-40%) exhibit 
best performance on testing alignments in that range. 
Thus residue substitution and insertion/deletion statistics are 
different for sequence pairs with different degrees of similar-
ity, in agreement with other reports (16,17). Although models 
trained on pairs with the lowest identity range can perform 
slightly better (2%) on representatives in that range, 
they perform much worse on alignments with the highest 
identity range (nearly 10% decrease as compared to models 
trained on pairs with the highest identity range). (ii) More 
complex HMMs improve alignment quality. For example, 
HMM_1_3_1 performs better than HMM_1_1_1 in almost 
every case. HMM_1_3_1 performs almost equally well to 
HMM_3_3_1. (iii) Our models trained on pairs with 
20-40% identity range perform better than several other 
aligners, such as <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> (23), <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> (11) with several 
option, <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> (10) and <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs> (7) on any testing data-
set. Although the simplest model HMM_1_1_0 has the same 
model structure as the one used in <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, it gives 3-4% 
increase over ProbCons for every testing dataset. The best 
models HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1 give 4-5% increase 
over <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>. (iv) When trained on BAliBASE2.0, 
HMM_1_1_0 and HMM_1_1_1 exhibit inferior performance </p>

<p>compared to the same models trained on SCOP domain pairs 
with identity above 20%, suggesting that SCOP domain pairs 
with above 20% identity is a better training dataset than 
BAliBASE2.0. The two models (especially HMM_1_1_1) 
trained on BAliBASE2.0 nevertheless give slightly better 
performance than <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, which was also trained on 
BAliBASE2.0 but with a different training method (unsuper-
vised learning) (23). 
To further compare the performance of our HMMs and 
the one used in <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, we tested sequence pairs from 
BAliBASE2.0, on which the HMM in ProbCons was trained 
(Supplementary Table S4). BAliBASE2.0 is a manually 
curated database for testing multiple alignment programs. It 
contains core blocks (uppercase letters) with good quality 
and a large fraction of lowercase letter regions where high 
alignment quality is not guaranteed. HMM_1_1_0 and 
HMM_1_1_1 trained on <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> alignments of SCOP 
domain pairs with above 20% identity show better results 
than these two models trained on BAliBASE2.0 as well as 
<rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, suggesting that the structural alignments of rela-
tively divergent SCOP domains form a better training set 
than BAliBASE2.0. HMM_1_3_1 trained on the same 
SCOP domain pairs gives the best BAliBASE2.0 results 
(Supplementary Table S4), confirming that a more complex 
model with multiple match states of secondary structures 
improves alignment quality. </p>

<p>We implemented our HMM models in a multiple sequence 
alignment program based on probabilistic consistency. 
Our program is named <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs>, standing for MUltiple 
alignment with Multiple MAtch state models of Local 
Structure. <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> was compared to several other pro-
grams, such as <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> (23), <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> (11), MUSCLE (10) </p>

<p>Trained on <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> alignments of SCOP40 domain pairs with 20-40% identity. </p>

<p>and ClustalW (7). We assembled testing datasets of multiple 
sequences by adding homologs to pairwise alignments 
of SCOP domain pairs (see Materials and Methods). For 
three testing datasets with identity ranges below 20%, 
<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> shows 3-4% increase of average Q-score 
over <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> when the best-performing HMMs are selected 
(HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1) (Table 2). For the dataset 
with identity range above 20%, the improvement is less 
prominent (1%), although still statistically significant (P &lt; 
0.005). Among the other programs tested (<rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, several 
options of <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs>, <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> and <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs>), MAFFT with 
options [lg]insi usually gives the best performance. Our pro-
gram still outperforms any <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> option by 2% for the 
three datasets with identity ranges below 20%. 
The other two large datasets we have used for testing are 
PREFAB version 4 (PREFAB4) (10) and SABmark version 
1.65 (33). PREFAB4 consists of 1682 alignments based on 
the consensus of two structural alignment programs <rs type="software">SOFI</rs> 
(40) and <rs type="software">CE</rs> (41), with up to 24 homologous sequences 
added from database searches. SABmark database has two 
alignment sets. The 'twilight zone' set contains SCOP 
(version 1.65) domain pairs with very low-to-low similarity 
and the 'superfamily' set contains SCOP domains with 
low to intermediate similarity. The reference alignments in 
SABmark were also derived from the consensus of <rs type="software">SOFI</rs> 
and CE. The comparison of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with the other 
programs on PREFAB4 and SABmark shows similar trends 
as seen in datasets assembled by us. <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with the 
best-performing models (HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1) 
gives the highest average Q-scores, with 2-4% increase 
over <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> and 1% increase over the best of the 
<rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> series (Table 2). 
We also tested these programs on datasets of 55 
HOMSTRAD structural alignments (11,34) with various 
numbers of homologs added (Supplementary Table S5). </p>

<p><rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> performs better than other programs for testing 
datasets 'HOM + 0', 'HOM + 20' and 'HOM + 50'. The 
results of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> on 'HOM + 100' are inferior to 
those on 'HOM + 50', which is in contrast to <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> that 
shows consistent increase of accuracy when more homologs 
are added. We reason that such a problem of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> 
is due to excessive number of close homologs in some 
sequence subgroups in 'HOM + 100' test cases, since our 
consistency measure does not take into account similarities 
among the testing sequences. To test this hypothesis, we 
removed closely related sequences in 'HOM + 100' align-
ment at 50 or 60% identity level (datasets 'HOM + 
100_bcl50' and 'HOM + 100_bcl60'). The remaining 
sequences are more balanced in terms of similarities among 
them. We indeed obtained the best <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> performance 
after removing closely related sequences (Supplementary 
Table S5). A similar degrading effect of closely related 
sequences is observed for <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, which is also based on 
probabilistic consistency. 
Recently, BAliBASE3.0 multiple alignment benchmark 
has been released (35). We tested the programs on 218 
BAliBASE3.0 alignments with full-length sequences. These 
alignments represent difficult cases since N-or C-terminal 
non-homologous regions are included for some sequences. 
The average Q-scores and column scores (the fraction of 
entirely correctly columns) in manually defined core blocks 
are reported in Table 2. For Q-score measurement of align-
ment quality, the Wilcoxon signed rank tests show that 
<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with best-performing models (HMM_3_3_1 or 
HMM_1_3_1) is statistically better than other programs, 
albeit MUMMALS does not have the highest average 
Q-score. For column score measurement of alignment 
quality, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with HMM_3_3_1 or HMM_1_3_1 
has a lower average column score than <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs>-[le]insi and 
<rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, but the difference between them is not statistically </p>

<p>The format of the HMM names ('HMM_solv_ss_u') is explained in Table1. Average Q-scores are shown for all the testing datasets. For the BAliBASE3.0 dataset, 
both the Q-score ('Q', first number) and column score ('col', second number, fraction of entirely correct columns) are shown. The first four testing datasets are 
representative SCOP40 domain pairs with added homologs. SABmark has 'superfamily' dataset (sup) and 'twilight zone' dataset (twi). The number of alignments in 
each testing dataset is shown in parentheses and the identity range in % is specified above the number of alignments for SCOP datasets. <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> implementing 
different HMMs are the first five methods. All sequences pairs are subject to consistency measure in <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs>. The best scores of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> and the best 
scores of other programs are in bold. </p>

<p><rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with this model is statistically better than the best of other programs according to Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P &lt; 0.015). 
b For BAliBASE3.0 test, the difference between <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with model HMM_1_3_1 or HMM_3_3_1 and this program is not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) 
according to Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. </p>

<p>For BAliBASE3.0 test, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with model HMM_1_3_1 or HMM_3_3_1 is statistically better than this program (P-value less than 0.01, except for Q-scores 
of <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, for which P ¼ 0.017). </p>

<p>significant. In fact <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with HMM_3_3_1 out-
performs <rs type="software">MAFFT-linsi</rs> (having the best average scores) in 
106 cases while MAFFT-linsi performs better in 67 cases, 
measured by column score. 
We found that the major cause of lower average column 
score of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> is due to a few alignments that 
MUMMALS gives considerably lower scores as compared 
to <rs type="software">MAFFT-linsi</rs> (10 alignments with a score difference larger 
than 0.5). Manual inspections of these alignments revealed 
some interesting scenarios. In some cases, the low scores of 
<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> are due to wrong alignment of a few divergent 
sequences, some of which have long extensions at the ends. 
Column score is very sensitive in such situations, since a 
low score is produced even if only one sequence is incorrectly 
aligned in many places. <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> alignments with local 
options ([le]insi) indeed show advantage in these situations 
(11). In several other cases, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> produces struc-
turally meaningful alignments that are scored very low 
since they are not consistent with the reference alignments 
(Supplementary Figure S1). One example is testing case 
BB40037, for which the reference alignment aligns the 
'fer2' domain [2Fe-2S iron sulfur cluster binding domain, 
named by Conserved Domain Database (42)] that is present 
in every sequence. Inspection of the sequences revealed 
two groups of sequences with different domain architectures 
in BB40037 (Supplementary Figure S1a). One group contains 
three domains in the order of 'fer2', 'FAD_binding_6' (oxi-
doreductase FAD-binding domain) and 'NAD_binding_1' 
(oxidoreductase NAD-binding domain). The other group 
contains the same three domains, but in the order of 
'FAD_binding_6', 'NAD_binding_1' and 'fer2'. <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> 
aligns 'FAD_binding_6' and 'NAD_binding_1' for the two 
groups and thus misaligned the 'fer2' domain. Since the 
reference-dependent evaluation is based on 'fer2' domain, 
<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> alignment gets a column score of zero. Another 
evaluation problem is caused by domain duplication or 
repeats, as exemplified by test case BB40040. Most of 
BB40040 sequences have a single domain of carbonic anhy-
drase. However, the sequence 'CAH_DUNSA' has two such 
domains (Supplementary Figure S1b). The reference align-
ment aligns the first domain of 'CAH_DUNSA' to other 
sequences while <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> aligns most of the second 
domain to other sequences, resulting in a low column score. </p>

<p>Model HMM_1_3_1 has hidden secondary structure-
dependent match states that are used in alignment construc-
tion. However, secondary structure predictions are not 
explicitly generated and remain 'hidden' in the alignment 
process. A posterior decoding technique can be applied to 
this model to output explicit secondary structure predictions 
(see Supplementary Data for details). The prediction accuracy 
is 60% on representative SCOP domains (Supplementary 
Table S6). This prediction accuracy is lower than many 
advanced methods, such as <rs type="software">PSI-PRED</rs> (43), which use 
homologs from database searches to enhance the secondary 
structure signal of a single sequence. Our HMM-based pre-
diction of secondary structure corresponds to a single 
sequence predictor, since position-specific information from 
multiple homologs is not used. The prediction accuracy of </p>

<p>model HMM_1_3_1 is comparable to other methods that 
generate predictions based on a single sequence (44). 
If secondary structure information is known for one of the 
aligned sequences, model HMM_1_3_1 can be modified to 
restrict the hidden state path to follow the experimental 
secondary structure (see Supplementary Data). Using real 
secondary structural information in <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with 
model HMM_1_3_1, we were able to obtain an average 
Q-score increase of 3% on SABmark datasets (Supplemen-
tary Table S8). Such a result suggests that one limitation of 
<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> is the low accuracy of the implicit secondary 
structure prediction. Further improvement of alignment 
quality should be possible with more accurate secondary 
structure predictions that explore database homologs. </p>

<p>All previously described tests are based on comparison with 
reference alignments that are treated as 'gold standards'. It is 
unclear how the quality of reference 'gold' alignments influ-
ences the ranking of alignment programs (45). Several exam-
ples from BAliBASE3.0 show some problems with reference-
dependent evaluation. Since the structures of all domains in 
our testing datasets are known, we can evaluate the quality 
of a test alignment using reference-independent scores that 
reflect the similarity between two structures after they are 
superimposed according to aligned residues in the test align-
ment. The structural scores we have used are: DALI Z-score, 
TM-score, GDT-TS score, 3D-score and two LiveBench 
contact scores. From Table 3, it is clear that <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> 
with the best-performing models (HMM_1_3_1 and 
HMM_3_3_1) produces higher average reference-
independent structural scores than other programs for diver-
gent domain pairs (identity below 20%), suggesting that our 
HMM models produce potentially more useful alignments in 
terms of structure modeling. Interestingly, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> does 
not produce the highest reference-independent sequence-
based similarity scores (sequence identity and BLOSUM62 
scores of aligned residue pairs). This result suggests that 
minimization of these sequence similarity measures alone 
does not lead to better alignment quality for divergent 
sequences. Our experiments with reference-independent 
evaluation shows good correlation with reference-dependent 
results described above, thus rendering a 'gold standard' 
reference unnecessary for alignment evaluation. </p>

<p><rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> shows improvement over <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> and <rs type="software">Prob-
Cons</rs> by only a few percent in terms of average alignment 
quality scores on various testing datasets. Although this 
improvement is statistically significant and does not depend 
on the testing dataset (assembled by us, or by other 
researchers) or alignment quality measure (reference-
dependent Q-score, or reference-independent DALI Z-score, 
TM-score, GDT-TS, etc), it is not clear what these average 
scores actually represent. To gain more understanding, we 
directly compared alignment scores of different programs 
for individual domain pairs. Table 4 shows the number of 
alignments where one program performs better than another 
program by 10% or more (measured by Q-score or </p>

<p>normalized TM-score) for 1207 divergent SCOP40 pairs with 
added homologs (sequence identity &lt;20%). The numbers for 
such differences among <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> family of programs 
with five different HMMs are relatively small, suggesting 
that MUMMALS with different HMMs generates alignments 
not that different from each other. The differences between 
<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> and other programs are significantly larger. 
For example, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with HMM_3_3_1 has a large 
Q-score increase (&gt;10%) over <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> on 201 alignments, 
while ProbCons is better by 10% or more on 62 alignments. 
For <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with HMM_3_3_1 and <rs type="software">MAFFT-ginsi</rs>, these 
numbers are 199 and 117, respectively. Our comparisons thus 
suggest that different programs can explore somewhat differ-
ent regions in alignment space, and the program giving lower 
average performance may be capable of generating better 
alignments in many cases. However, selection of a better 
alignment in the absence of structural comparison is still a 
difficult task (46). </p>

<p><rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> (23) and <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> (11) are two of the most accurate 
multiple sequence alignment programs that explore only 
sequence information. They use different strategies to 
improve the accuracy of progressive alignment. <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> 
mainly relies on the consistency-based scoring function and 
<rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> utilizes iterative refinement. <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs>'s scoring func-
tion is a weighted sum-of-pairs score of BLOSUM62, a gen-
eral amino acid substitution matrix. Recent versions of 
<rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> enhance performance by exploring aligned core 
regions with a simple consistency measure (11). However, 
the time-consuming <rs type="software">ProbCons-type</rs> consistency operations 
on sequence triplets are not implemented in <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs>. Our 
results show that <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> based on probabilistic consis-
tency can perform better than <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs>, implying that 
consistency-based scoring function is superior to weighted 
sum-of-pairs measures of general substitution matrices. 
Among existing multiple aligners, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> is meth-
odologically closest to <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>. However, we implement </p>

<p>HMMs that are different from the one used in <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> 
in three aspects. First, we introduce more complex model 
structures by increasing the number of match state types. 
While HMM_1_1_0, used mainly as a control, has the 
same model structure as the one in <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, the other 
four models (HMM_1_1_1, HMM_1_3_1, HMM_3_1_1 
and HMM_3_3_1) incorporate more match states, which 
take into account residue substitution differences in unaligned 
regions and aligned core blocks, as well as local structural 
differences in aligned core blocks. Second, we have estimated 
model parameters from <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> structural alignments of 
divergent SCOP domains (&lt;40% identity), while the training 
data of <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> are from BAliBASE2.0. Third, we applied a 
supervised learning approach to estimating model parameters 
from structural alignments that have known hidden state 
paths. <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> applied an unsupervised learning approach 
(expectation maximization) to derive parameters without 
using reference alignments. Trained and tested on <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> 
structural alignments of SCOP40 domain pairs and on 
BAliBASE2.0 alignments, our models give better alignment 
quality than <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs> and a number of other programs. We 
show that more complex models improve alignment quality 
and SCOP40 superfamily pairs with identity range of 20-
40% provide a better training dataset than BAliBASE2.0 
alignments. 
Although we do not explicitly perform structure prediction 
in the course of alignment construction, our HMMs with 
multiple match states have built-in information of residue 
substitution characteristics in distinct local structure 
environments. Such information is learned from structural 
alignments in the training process and is encoded in the mod-
els. Since these match states are hidden states, our HMMs 
construct alignments using only sequence information. In 
this aspect, our method is different from some other methods 
that require direct use of real or predicted local structural 
information (19,47). </p>

<p>The first five methods are <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> implementing different HMMs. The format of the HMM names ('HMM_solv_ss_u') is explained in Table 1. The best scores 
of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> and the best scores of other programs (<rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>, <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> with different options, <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs>, <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs>) are in bold. </p>

<p><rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with this model is statistically better than the best of other programs according to Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P &lt; 0.01). </p>

<p>(Supplementary Table S2). HMM_3_3_1 (modeling both 
secondary structure and solvent accessibility) has the 
largest number of hidden states and is the most time-
consuming model, running about three times slower than 
HMM_1_3_1 (modeling only secondary structure). However, 
the performance of these two models is fairly similar in pair-
wise or multiple sequence alignment tests (Tables 1-3). 
HMM_3_1_1 (modeling only solvent accessibility) has the 
same time complexity as HMM_1_3_1, but usually shows 
slightly inferior performance to HMM_1_3_1. These obser-
vations suggest that HMM_1_3_1 (modeling only secondary 
structure) is most efficient in balancing alignment accuracy 
and speed. 
For <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs>, the rate-limiting steps are the computa-
tion of match probabilities using forward and backward algo-
rithms (time order is N 
2 *L 
2 *K </p>

<p>, N: number of sequences, 
L: average length, K: number of hidden states), and the com-
putation of the consistency-based scoring function, which 
requires operations on all sequence triplets (time order is 
N 
3 *L 
2 ). If probabilistic consistency measure is applied to 
every sequence pair, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> is much slower than 
<rs type="software">MAFFT</rs>, <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> and <rs type="software">ClustalW</rs> (Supplementary Table S9). 
For example, the median CPU time of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with 
model HMM_1_3_1 on 1785 SCOP40 pairs with added 
homologs is 174s per alignment, as compared to 2.5s for 
<rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> with 'ginsi' option (on Redhat Enterprise Linux 3, 
AMD Opteron 2.0 GHz). Applying a two-stage alignment 
strategy similar to the one used in the program <rs type="software">PCMA</rs> (32), 
we were able to make <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> almost an order of mag-
nitude faster while still maintaining the same level of align-
ment accuracy on SCOP testing datasets (Supplementary 
Table S9). Since highly similar sequences can be aligned 
accurately with a general scoring function (8), there is no 
need for all of them to be subject to the time-consuming con-
sistency measure. Although adding homologous sequences 
can in general improve alignment quality, our results on 
HOMSTRAD datasets suggest that proper balance of the 
similarity among the added homologs is also critical for 
<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> as well as <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>. </p>

<p>The first five methods are <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> implementing different HMMs. The format of the HMM names ('HMM_solv_ss_u') is explained in Table 1. Each none-diagonal cell has two numbers separated by a slash. 
The first number is the number of cases where the alignment quality score of the program listed to the left (in a row) is inferior to that of the program listed above (in a column) by 0.1 or more. The second number is 
the number of cases where the score of the 'row' program is better than that of the 'column' program by 0.1 or more. The alignment quality scores in the lower triangle and upper triangle are </p>

<p>and normalized TM-scores, respectively. Comparisons of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> with the best model (HMM_3_3_1) with other programs are highlighted in bold. </p>

<p>alignments that are correct from structure modeling pers-
pective. However, structure superposition programs usually 
provide a single best alignment. Some problems of reference-
dependent evaluations are illustrated by examples from 
BAliBASE3.0. For SCOP40 testing datasets, we found 
about 20 domain pairs for which all sequence-based programs 
failed to align a single position correctly according to 
<rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> reference alignment. Manual inspection of these 
instances suggests that most of these domains involve struc-
tural repeats. Many alignments produced by the tested pro-
grams did produce structurally meaningful results, but they 
had zero scores because they matched different repeats than 
those aligned by <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs>. 
Reference-independent evaluation can avoid these 
drawbacks. Although reference-independent evaluation is 
routinely used for assessing structure prediction models 
(50,51), it has not been frequently used in assessment of 
multiple sequence alignment programs (10,45). Our results 
show that reference-independent evaluation using various 
structural similarity scores produces similar, if not identical, 
rankings of the programs compared to reference-dependent 
evaluations using <rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> alignments (Table 3). On the one 
hand, this result suggests that a large collection of reference 
alignments generated by structure alignment program 
<rs type="software">DaliLite</rs> are on average well-suited for assessment of align-
ment quality. On the other hand, it is probably unnecessary 
to have a set of 'gold standard' reference alignments. 
Reference-independent evaluation through scoring super-
positions generated according sequence-based alignments 
is an easier and maybe more fair method to assess align-
ment quality and to compare different aligners. Therefore, 
particularly when the size of a testing dataset is large, 
improving reference alignment quality either by manual 
inspection and adjustment (30), or by using the consensus 
of structural aligners (10,33) is probably not necessary. 
With reference-independent evaluation techniques, we 
even suggest bypassing the step of generating reference 
alignments. </p>

<p>Despite several percentage points' improvement in align-
ments provided by <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs>, alignment quality for 
divergent sequences (sequence identity &lt;15%) is still not 
high, since only 50% or even less residue pairs on average 
are aligned correctly according to reference alignments 
(Table 2). Although the best programs (<rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs>, 
<rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> and <rs type="software">ProbCons</rs>) have limited differences in terms of 
average alignment quality score, they can produce quite 
different alignments for some sequence pairs (Table 4). It 
can be a good practice to use several aligners to generate 
alignments for divergent sequences. Manual examination of 
these alignments can be helpful in making expert judgments. 
Exploration of the consensus among programs is fruitful as 
well and is frequently used in meta-servers for structure 
prediction (52-54). Results of the meta-aligner <rs type="software">M-COFFEE</rs> 
(46) as well as ours (data not shown, <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> package 
contains a meta-program similar to M-COFFEE) suggest 
that combining different multiple sequence aligners can 
give significant but limited improvement of alignment 
quality. </p>

<p>One advantage of <rs type="software">MUMMALS</rs> is the use of HMMs with 
local structure information learned from structural align-
ments. Our model HMM_1_3_1 gives low secondary struc-
ture prediction accuracy. Providing real secondary structure 
information to this model can further improve alignment 
quality by a few percent. These results suggest that applica-
tion of more accurate secondary structure predictions can 
lead to better alignment quality. Exploration of database 
sequence homologs and available 3D structures was also 
shown to be helpful (11,55,56). Further enhancement of 
multiple alignment quality could be achieved by effective 
integration of existing alignment techniques and various 
evolutionary and structural information resources. </p>

<p>Scalp EEG was continuously recorded from 64 tin electrodes 
mounted in an elastic cap (Electro-cap International, USA). Elec-
trodes were also placed above and below the right eye and on 
the outer canthi of both eyes to record vertical and horizontal 
eye movements and blinks. The signals were referenced to the 
left mastoid and sampled at a rate of 500 Hz. Impedance at each 
electrode was kept at or below 5 kΩ. The signals were amplified 
by Neuroscan SynAmps2 amplifiers (Neuroscan, USA) and fil-
tered on-line with a band-pass filter (0.05-100 Hz, 24-dB/octave 
attenuation). Data were stored off-line for further analysis. 
For all preprocessing and subsequent analysis, we used the 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">FieldTrip toolbox</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Oostenveld</rs> et al., 2011) which is implemented 
in <rs id="software-1" type="software">Matlab</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Mathworks</rs>, MA, USA). We performed the following 
preprocessing steps: re-referencing to the average of the left and 
right mastoid channels, band-pass filtering 0.3-100, 60 Hz line fil-
tering, and artifact removal. Prior to artifact removal, EEG epochs 
were extracted from the continuous EEG from 1000 ms before, 
to 2000 ms after onset of the CWs. Single word epochs with arti-
facts that occurred between 200 ms before to 800 ms after stimulus 
onset were removed from analysis. A Z -score based algorithm was 
used to detect eye blinks and eye movements, and other artifacts 
were detected with a threshold algorithm. After removal, about 
70% of single word epochs remained. There were an average (mar-
ginal means) of 436 single word epochs in the sentence condition, 
462 in the scrambled sentence condition, 480 in the OC condi-
tion, and 417 in the CC condition. The cell means were 220 for 
OC in sentence, 260 for OC in scrambled sentence, 216 for CC </p>

<p>select the W matrix or model specification. Finally, we asked them whether they 
made software code available based on the papers they have published and where 
we can find this code. The results are the following. Studies that developed J-
tests are Kelejian (2008), Burridge &amp; Fingleton (2010), Burridge (2012), Han &amp; 
Lee (2013), and Kelejian &amp; Piras (2011, 2014a, 2016). Studies that used these J-
tests in their empirical research are Fell &amp; Haynie (2013) and Liu et al. (2014). 
Finally, nobody appears to have made software code available. The conclusion 
must be that J-tests have rarely been used in empirical research up to now and 
that the main bottleneck for practitioners is the lack of freely downloadable soft-
ware. Hence, besides further developing J-tests, and stating that J-tests are a useful 
tool to select the right spatial weights matrix and/or spatial econometric model spe-
cification, we suggest that the researchers who have been active in this field may 
have even more impact if they make their software available. This would follow 
LeSage (2015), who has made available code written in <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> relating to his Baye-
sian comparison approach. 
Thirdly, to test the two alternative economic-theoretical hypotheses against 
each other, Fingleton &amp; Palombi (2015) adopt the so-called SARAR-RE spatial 
econometric model. This implies that the dependent variable, local weekly wage 
rates, in addition to regular explanatory variables, is explained by its counterparts 
in neighbouring districts within commuting distance (less than one hundred kilo-
metres), and that the error term is assumed to be spatially autocorrelated and con-
tains a spatial random effect. Further, it is to be noted that the unemployment 
rate in the spatial wage curve and the market potential in the NEG model are 
spatially lagged, which is known as the Spatial lag of X (SLX) type of specification. 
Two remarks apply to this specification, which may have driven the results of this 
interesting study. It is not immediately clear why the wage rate of one district in 
the spatial wage curve model may depend on that of others. The NEG provides 
a theoretical explanation for this relationship, although non-linear rather than 
linear, but the spatial wage curve model does not. Since all districts are considered 
rather than a random sample from a larger population, it would have made sense to 
consider a fixed effects model too. An interesting counter-argument is the one set 
forth by Palombi et al. (2015, p. 8) stating that it is possible to consider the data 
to be one of many realizations from a superpopulation, since the spatial partitions 
giving the areal units are just one of an infinite number of possible sets that could 
have occurred. This is an argument that is new to the literature. 
In the second paper, Abate (2015, in this issue) investigates GDP per capita 
growth in a panel of 78 countries over the period 1970-2010. His starting point 
is the spatial Durbin model (SDM), which is partly theoretically but also partly 
empirically driven. The innovation is that volatility, measured as the standard devi-
ation of the residuals of the growth equation, is also included as an explanatory vari-
able. To approach this variable, a two-step ML procedure is used. As expected, the 
author finds that the impact of this variable on GDP per capita growth is negative. 
The spatial arrangement between the countries is specified as a bilateral trade 
weights matrix. This combination of the SDM model with a dense matrix leads 
to complex interpretations, since global spillover effects (SDM) generally tend to 
go hand in hand with a sparse spatial weights matrix and local spillovers (SDEM, 
spatial Durbin error model) with a dense spatial weights matrix. This might 
explain why the coefficient of the spatial lag decreases so strongly when spatial 
and time period fixed effects are controlled for. It also illustrates Corrado &amp; </p>

<p>In November 2013, when the data analyzed in this study were collected, Brazil had 
40 crowdfunding platforms that were listed on specialized sites, e.g., (http:// 
mapadocrowdfunding.tumblr.com). Among the different types of projects spon-
sored, the majority were creative and predominantly cultural projects, although 
there were other more specific objectives, e.g., financial support for soccer clubs at 
(http://vascodividazero.com.br). The dominant site among the 40 crowdfunding 
platforms is Catarse, which was the focus of this study. Only the Catarse website 
was considered, and all of the projects meeting the following criteria were selected: 
(1) The entrepreneurs were musicians who were using the platform to seek funds for 
financing the first album of their artistic career, and (2) the target funding was 
between R$ 10,000 and R$ 30,000 (US$ 1,00 = R$ 2,80); indeed, 95 % of the 
projects hosted on the platform fall in this range value. Because of that, this range 
was considered. 
The data collection required for constructing the variables under consideration 
took place in two main phases. The first phase focused on the Catarse platform 
(http://catarse.me), where two types of data were obtained: data from browsing the 
website directly and data provided by the platform's founders to its entrepreneurs 
and sponsors through the privacy policy for the platform. The second data collection 
phase examined socioeconomic data for the municipalities where the 1835 pledges 
considered in the research originated. These data were obtained from the Brazilian 
Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE-Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e 
Estatística), and we drew on the most recent Brazilian Census, which was con-
ducted in 2010. 
The geographic distance between the entrepreneurs and the donors was 
obtained for the cities where they were located, and we used Google Maps APIs 
(http://code.google.com/apis/maps/) to identify the coordinates of each location. 
The distance was calculated using the procedure adopted by Nichols (2003) with 
the tool <rs id="software-1" type="software">ArcGIS ArcMap</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">10.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">ESRI</rs> 2010). The motivation for using these 
types of tools comes from the argument that when the data's spatial distribution 
is related to the phenomena occurring in the territory, one has a modern way to 
clarify questions related to various fields of knowledge (Ebner et al. 2009). The 
use of these techniques in the business field is in an embryonic stage (Good-
child 2010), especially in studies of collaborative phenomena (Sui et al. 2013). 
In addition, geographical information systems (GISs) could be a tool toward 
providing a spatial explanation of governance, population and cultural assets 
(Redaelli 2012). </p>

<p>braries were confirmed by electrophoresis on Agilent DNA 
500 Bioanalyzer microfluidic chips. Libraries were quanti-
fied using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KK4824, 
Kapa Biosystems). The libraries were pooled at equimolar 
concentrations and diluted to 13 pmol prior to loading onto 
the flow cell of the cBot cluster station (Illumina). The li-
braries were extended and bridge-amplified to create single 
sequence clusters using the TruSeq SR Cluster Kit version 
3 -HS (Illumina). The flow cell carrying amplified clus-
ters was loaded on the HiSeq 2000 sequencing system (Il-
lumina) and sequenced with 50-bp single-end reads using 
the TruSeq SBS Kit version 3 -HS (Illumina). Ten percent 
X174 phage DNA was spiked into all sequencing lanes for 
sequencer calibration. Real-time image analysis and base 
calling were performed on the instrument using the <rs type="software">HiSeq 
Sequencing Control Software</rs>. <rs id="software-6" type="software">CASAVA</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">version 1.8</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Illumina</rs>) was used for de-multiplexing and production 
of FASTQ sequence files. </p>

<p>The <rs id="software-7" type="software">FASTX application</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-7" type="url">www.molecularevolution.org</rs>) 
was used to trim adapter sequences from the 3'-end of 
the sequence read, discard any sequence of &lt;17 nts after 
trimming and to collapse identical reads into single en-
tries retaining the read count for each unique sequence. 
Non-redundant sequences were then aligned to genomic 
RNA and mRNA sequences of hg19 using <rs id="software-8" type="software">Bowtie 2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="url">www.bowtie-bio.sf.net</rs>) (35) and matched sequences were re-
tained and aligned to common and abundant non-coding 
RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs). Remaining sequences 
were further aligned to known mature and precursor 
miRNAs using the miRbase 19 database (www.mirbase. 
org). Additional alignments to a transcript database (En-
sembl version 75, http://www.ensembl.org) (36) and the spe-
cific piRNA database <rs id="software-17" type="software">piRNABank</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-17" type="url">http://pirnabank.ibab. ac.in</rs>/) were also performed (37). Alignment result files 
were parsed using the R statistical language (http://www. 
R-project.org) and the <rs id="software-10" type="software">Bioconductor</rs> project (<rs corresp="#software-10" type="url">http://www.bioconductor.org</rs>) (38) to generate tables including the read 
count and annotation information for each entry in the tar-
get database. Raw read counts for each RNA class from all 
samples in the study were then joined in raw data tables. 
The raw reads were converted to reads per kilobase of target 
length per million mapped reads (39). All sequences were 
deposited into the <rs id="software-20" type="software">GEO</rs> database (<rs corresp="#software-20" type="url">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</rs>/) under accession number GSE56076. Calculation 
of percent of reads by biotype was based on raw read counts 
of perfectly matched transcripts for each biotype compared 
to total reads for each library. </p>

<p>Abundance of RNA biotypes in SE across donors was an-

the focal plane of the Olympus microscope and moved the specimen in the x,y,z-axes through 
the light-sheet using Newport 423 linear stages and three Newport motors. This was similar to 
a procedure developed by Buytaert and Dirckx [8]. Figure 1 shows (in the upper left panel) 
TSLIM's original start/stop procedure that was used to move the specimen in the x-direction 
and to collect columns of image data whose width are less than or equal to the confocal 
parameter of the light-sheet. 
Since great accuracy and speed is not necessary in the y-axis, this direction is manually 
controlled by a Newport NSC200, which drives an open-loop Newport CMA-25PP motor 
with a bi-directional repeatability of 4 µm and velocity of 0.4 mm/s. However, in the x-and z-
axes, Newport's computer guided ESP301 motion controller in combination with Newport's 
LTA-HS closed loop servomotors (with a typical bi-directional repeatability of 0.6 µm and 
velocity of 5 mm/s) are used to position the specimen. A <rs type="software">LabVIEW</rs> program coordinates 
image acquisition and motor positioning simultaneously. The image acquisition routine 
consists of grabbing a column of image data from the camera and moving the specimen the 
width of that column and then collecting another column. These columns are stitched together 
to form a composite image across the full width of the specimen. 
Figure 2(a) shows the ROI (i.e., the confocal paramater) in an image of the mouse cochlea. 
The Rayleigh range x R was calculated [1] with the 5X Plan Apo microscopic objective to 
approximately 34 µm and thus the confocal parameter b is 68 µm. To the left and the right of 
the ROI, the image appears out-of-focus due to greater beam thickness and light scattering. In 
addition, a blur is present in the lower left of the image, which is due to the presence of a high 
density structure (i.e. bone) in the cochlea that lies between the optical section and collecting 
lens of the Olympus microscope. However, Fig. 2(b) shows that stitching of multiple ROIs 
across the width of the specimen, results in improved focus of specimen across its width. 
Higher magnification of these stitched image columns [Fig. 2(c)] reveals some stitching 
artifacts due to image column misalignments. </p>

<p>The resolution of the encoder s i was determined by moving the motor 1 mm and counting 
the encoder signals. One encoder impulse for the Newport LTA-HS is equivalent to s i = 0.14 
µm which is important for the calculation of the relationship i. For example, the Retiga 2000R 
at 5x magnification p/M = 1.48 µm/pixel and when w ROI = 9 lines, an output signal has to be 
generated after every 94 input ticks of the encoder. This signal goes directly over the digital 
output via the SCB-68 connector block into the optic-coupled input of the camera where it 
initiates an exposure of the chip. The pictures are picked up on demand by a loop in the 
controlling <rs type="software">LabVIEW</rs> program. The whole concept for a hardware triggered system is 
summarized in Fig. 3. </p>

Cardiac output from a seated resting baseline estimated preservation of cardiac func-
tion. Impedance cardiography signals were recorded via a Hutcheson Impedance Cardio-
graph (Model HIC-3000, Bio-Impedance Technology, Chapel Hill, N.C., USA) using a tet-
rapolar band-electrode configuration. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from the 
Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph using disposable ECG electrodes. The basal thoracic 
impedance (Zo), the first derivative of the pulsatile impedance (dZ/dt) and the ECG wave-
forms were processed using specialized ensemble-averaging software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">COP</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">BIT Inc.</rs>., Chapel 
Hill, N.C., USA), which was used to derive stroke volume using the Kubicek equation. Fol-
lowing instrumentation, Impedance cardiographic signals were recorded for seven 40-sec-
ond periods during a 10-min resting baseline. Finally, all cardiac output measurements were 
divided by body surface area, yielding cardiac index ( table 1 ). 
Blood pressure (BP) was measured 7 times during the 10-min resting baseline using an 
automated oscillometric BP device (Accutor Plus Oscillometric BP Monitor, Datascope Corp., 
Mahwah, N.H., USA) providing systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures. Initiating the 
BP reading triggered a concurrent 40-second impedance cardiography measure. The mean 
systolic and diastolic BP across the 7 trials served as the indices of systolic and diastolic BP. </p>

(Maastricht) as a regressor. Now we discuss the 
results given by the three estimators and explain the 
choice of the preferred one. The signs of parameters 
given by all three estimators seem well in line with 
the expectations. In particular, the parameter for the 
real interest rate is always positive regardless of the 
choice of interest rate. A negative sign of the para-
meter for population change suggest that, not surpris-
ingly, a shrinking (ageing) society is more likely to be 
dissaving and therefore soaking up the capital from 
abroad. Although population change did not always 
turn statistically significant, due to strong priors we 
keep this variable in the model. Finally, the negative 
sign of lagged NFA coefficient shows that no country 
may run CA deficits/surpluses forever. 
In the next step, we explain the choice of our 
preferred model. As expected, OLS estimates of 
parameter ρ are somehow larger than those of FE. 
However, reported point estimates of parameters 
using bias-corrected FE (we employed <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Bruno</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2005</rs> <rs id="software-1" type="software">Stata</rs> routine) are almost the same as the FE 
estimates, which suggest that the Nickell bias seems 
negligible in our context (and that OLS estimates 
suffer from omitted variable bias). Also the signifi-
cance of country dummies suggests that OLS esti-
mates may not be the most reliable ones. Finally, it 
should be noted that the FE estimates have a rela-
tively small variance, especially if compared to 
consistent estimators as GMM (Mátyás and 
Sevestre, 2008) or bias-corrected FE. For these rea-
sons, we choose the simple FE estimator as the 
preferred one. Regarding the specification tests, 
the Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation shows 
that including the lagged dependent variable and 
year dummies reduces problems with autocorrela-
tion. At no reasonable significance level, the null 
hypothesis (i.e. that there is no autocorrelation) 
should be rejected. To deal with heterogeneity we 
use robust SEs. 
Our core results may be then summarized as fol-
lows: An exogenous increase of the real interest rate 
(medium or long-term) by 1 percentage point results 
in an improvement in the CA-to-GDP ratio of 0.25-
0.28 pp in the same year. Including lagged NFA as a 
regressor makes the basic formula for a long-term 
multiplier invalid, therefore we present simulations 
based on the regression results in detail in Section V. 
To give some intuition, though, we can say that 
(ceteris paribus) an increase in a medium term real 
interest rate by 1 pp results in a rise in the NFA-to-
GDP ratio by 0.93-1.09 that is obtained after </p>

<p>I collect data on how subjects acquire information about risky choices in both real 
and hypothetical settings using process-tracing software called <rs type="software">Mouselab</rs>. On average, 
there are no significant differences across settings in the amount of time subjects take to 
make a choice or the completeness of the information they acquire. Subjects also acquire 
information in sequences consistent with an integration model of decision-making, such 
as expected utility theory or prospect theory. I do not find significant differences in risk 
preferences across settings, on average, but I do find that subjects' risk preferences are 
related to the completeness of the information that they acquire and where they start 
their information acquisition. (JEL C91, D80, D83) </p>

<p>cognitive ability tend to make choices exhibiting 
hypothetical bias. 2 
These contradictory results have yet to be 
explained. Camerer and Hogarth (1999) illustrate 
that real incentives are likely to alter behavior 
when the task involved depends on the subject's 
effort level. But the choices that are typically used 
to measure risk aversion are designed to measure 
preferences, not effort. Moreover, while it is clear 
how economic incentives can cause individuals 
to misrepresent their willingness to pay for clean 
air in a survey that could influence environmental 
policy, there is not an obvious economic moti-
vation for why individuals would systematically 
misrepresent their risk preferences so that they 
appear more risk tolerant when they make choices 
with hypothetical consequences. 3 
This study uses a method of process tracing 
to explore whether individuals acquire informa-
tion about the risky choices in the commonly used 
Holt and Laury multiple-price list (HL MPL) 
differently when the choices have hypothetical 
monetary consequences rather than real monetary 
consequences (Holt and Laury 2002). It is pos-
sible that individuals may attend to the informa-
tion in hypothetical choices differently than real 
choices, and several studies have demonstrated 
that how individuals acquire information can be 
related to their decision-making. For instance, 
Costa-Gomes and Crawford (2006) show that 
simplified searches are correlated with deviations 
from equilibrium in a two-person guessing game, 
and Caplin, Dean, and Martin (2011) find that 
search patterns can affect subjects' decisions con-
ditional on choice complexity. 
There is no doubt that subjects are willing to 
devote at least some time to the consideration of 
hypothetical choices. Psychologists frequently 
rely exclusively on hypothetical decisions to 
study behavior. Some of these studies have 
used <rs type="software">Mouselab</rs> or other process-tracing tech-
niques, and they demonstrate that individuals 
do spend time considering hypothetical choices 
(Willemsen and Johnson 2010). The question of 
interest here, however, is whether information </p>

<p>More recent studies that have explored this ques-
tion employed tasks and choices more akin to the 
types of choices typically used by economists to 
measure risk preferences (Arieli, Ben-Ami, and 
Rubinstein 2011; Glöckner and Herbold 2011; 
Johnson, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, and Willem-
sen 2008). 5 Interestingly, these studies have 
reached contradictory conclusions. For example, 
Johnson, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, and Willemsen 
(2008) and Glöckner and Herbold (2011) find 
information acquisition patterns consistent with 
integration models, but Arieli, Ben-Ami, and 
Rubinstein (2011) do not. The conflicting results 
are not due to differences in how the process data 
were collected. All three studies used hypothet-
ical payoffs, and Glöckner and Herbold (2011) 
and Arieli, Ben-Ami, and Rubinstein (2011) 
used eye-tracking technology, while Johnson, 
Schulte-Mecklenbeck, and Willemsen (2008) 
used <rs type="software">Mouselab</rs>. 
I find that there are not significant differ-
ences in individuals' information acquisition or 
their risk preferences, on average, across real and 
hypothetical settings. Subjects also acquire infor-
mation in a manner consistent with the implicit 
calculation of expected utility or another integra-
tive model. In other words, when individuals face 
the choices presented to them in the HL MPL, 
they do not merely make decisions "as if" they 
are integrating probabilities and outcomes, their 
search patterns suggest that they actually do. 
Subjects are not more likely to be inconsistent 
when their choices were made in the hypothetical 
setting, and, unsurprisingly, subjects who do not 
acquire enough information to compute expected 
value for most of their decisions the first time they 
complete the task are more likely to make incon-
sistent choices. Interestingly, subjects who are 
willing to make these decisions without acquiring 
sufficient information to compute expected value 
also tend to make choices that imply that they are 
significantly less risk averse than the rest of the 
sample, even after controlling for the number of 
inconsistent choices. 
The following section briefly describes the 
method used to observe subject information 
acquisition, as well as provides a detailed 
explanation of the experimental design and the </p>

<p>5. Glöckner and Betsch (2008) used a method that they 
call the "open <rs type="software">mouselab</rs> method," which does not actually 
mask the information and, instead, asked a subject to move the 
mouse to the piece of information about which she is thinking. 
They find that information search is more consistent with an 
integrative model using this method. </p>

<p>I use a software program called <rs type="software">Mouselab</rs> to 
observe how subjects acquire information about 
risky choices. <rs type="software">Mouselab</rs> is a method of process-
tracing used by psychologists for nearly three 
decades, and economists more recently, because 
it is lower-cost alternative to eye-tracking and 
provides analogous measures (Costa-Gomes 
and Crawford 2006; Costa-Gomes, Crawford, 
and Broseta 2001; Gabaix et al. 2006; Johnson 
et al. 2002; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1988; 
Reutskaja et al. 2011). The software enables the 
researcher to "mask" selected information so 
that a subject must move the computer pointer 
over the attribute to reveal it. In this experiment, 
the probabilities and payoffs (the attributes) of 
each gamble were masked and the individual was 
required to "unmask" the attributes by scrolling 
over the cell to view it. Once the mouse pointer 
leaves the cell, the attribute is hidden again. 
By requiring a subject to unmask the gambles' 
attributes and allowing them to view only one 
piece of information at a time, individuals' 
strategies for acquiring information about risky 
choices is observable in this stylized context. 6 
An example of how each pair of gambles was 
presented to subjects in the experiment is shown 
in Figure 1. 7 </p>

used the cutoff values defined in the original papers (SA , 4, Hart . 
0.01, PE ,5 1.5, Dice ,5 0.15) and we obtained four lists of reliable 
edges. The size of these lists varied from 6528 edges for Hart to 18278 
for PE, including 14004 for SA and 16447 for Dice. 
The edge lists were used to generate four Protein Interaction 
Networks (PINs). PIN-Dice contains 2192 nodes and 16447 edges, 
PIN-Hart contains 639 nodes and 6528 edges, PIN-PE contains 2344 
nodes and 18278 edges, and PIN-SA contains 2005 nodes and 14004 
edges. 
The four PINs were clustered using two different overlap-detect-
ing clustering methods: ''Link-communities''

by using Dice score and Link communities, 35 subcomplexes by PE 
score and Link communities, 67 subcomplexes by SA score and Link 
communities, 29 subcomplexes by Dice score and OCG, 7 subcom-
plexes by Hart score and OCG, and 34 subcomplexes by PE score and 
OCG. 
Subcomplexes predictions using the <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> method were gen-
erated by removing all complexes without attachments and then 
selecting the cores of the remaining complexes, as explained in 
Methods. The result was 309 subcomplex predictions. 
TRIBAL is a subcomplex prediction strategy, so all its predictions 
are subcomplexes. TRIBAL was applied to Gavin's dataset as 
explained in Methods, producing 18 subcomplex predictions. It is 
important to notice that the edges of the Dice-scored network are a 
subset of the edges of the PE-network, and, even more, TRIBAL's 
edges are a subset of the Dice-score (and, therefore, PE) methods. 
Therefore, TRIBAL seems to be generating a more strict network, 
with edges already validated for other methods, but with the differ-
ence that we keep the multiple edges that the other methods have 
removed. </p>

score and Link communities clustering. We hypothesize that the 
reason of this difference might be the fact that the hypergeometric 
score is more sensitive to the size of the complexes and <rs type="software">OCG</rs> is 
predicting complexes of a size larger than expected, as it can be 
observed in the Supplementary file (section 4). 
However, our main interest is not to evaluate the ability to identify 
complexes but the ability to identify subcomplexes. We begin by 
verifying that all datasets under study contain subcomplexes: The 
MIPS dataset (our reference set) includes 16 subcomplexes. Raw data 
includes 348 groups of proteins contained in others. None of the sets 
produced by hierarchical clustering display subcomplexes, as these 
are non-overlapping methods. The predicted sets (Dice-lcomm, PE-
lcomm, SA-lcomm, Dice-OCG, Hart-OCG, PE-OCG, CACHET and 
TRIBAL) display between 7 and 309 subcomplexes. 
In order to evaluate the subcomplex detection abilities of these 
methods, we performed two different analyses. Table 3 summarizes 
the precision and recall analysis for predicted subcomplexes when 
compared to the full MIPS dataset, using a hyper-geometric score as a 
criterion for a match. Table 4 does the same when using the geomet-
ric score. The results show that <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> has the best F-measure in 
both cases. Despite the fact that TRIBAL has the best precision in 
both cases, <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> has a far better recall which ultimately leads to a 
better F-measure. </p>

<p>For this reason, we use the meet-min index to verify that predicted 
subcomplexes are not only similar but contained by MIPS complexes. 
Figure 2 depicts the number and percentage of validated predicted 
subcomplexes for TRIBAL, <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> and six other methods which 
combine different scoring and clustering systems, using the meet-
min index as comparison criterion. The results show that TRIBAL 
outperforms all other methods for meet-min equal to 1.0. <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> 
shows a good performance to low meet-min values, but it decreases 
strongly when meet-min increases. </p>

<p>Discussion 
We have unveiled the limitants of AP-MS processing methods 
regarding their ability to predict subcomplexes and we have also 
suggested TRIBAL as an alternative solution to this. 
We have traditionally assumed that the fact that a pair of proteins 
shows multiple evidence of co-purification and few evidences of 
independent purification is a demonstration of the confidence that 
we can have in the quality of such an interaction. However, here we 
start from the assumption that it could also mean that the interaction 
can be repeated in multiple overlapping complexes. The current 
complex detection pipeline discards the second type of information 
because the scoring step converts all co-purifications to one inter-
action record. For this reason, a method to score interactions without 
removing the information of proteins co-purifying in different con-
texts (i.e. different complexes), could be useful. 
The scoring of triads of proteins instead of interactions has been 
our first attempt to design such a method. This is, instead of studying 
the pattern of co-purification and independent purification of a bait 
and a prey, we study the bait and pairs of preys. This way, we apply 
the Dice score to a modified pulldown matrix which contains the 
baits versus the pairs of preys that copurify with them. After remov-
ing low quality data and generating a PIN with the high quality triads, 
we also get a PIN with multiple edges. 
We tested and compared the performance of different combina-
tions of scoring methods (Dice, PE, Hart, SA) and overlapping clus-
tering algorithms (Link-communities, <rs type="software">OCG</rs>), with one method 
based on the core-attachment model (<rs type="software">CACHET</rs>) and our own 
method (TRIBAL). All these three types of methods are based on 
different assumptions; for example, that subcomplexes can be 
extracted from high-degree (highly connected) regions of the net-
work or, in our case, that co-purification information with different 
baits is not only useful as a data quality measure but can also include 
co-complex information in different biological contexts. These 
assumptions can be partially validated through the performances 
of the methods. The results show that <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> gives the best results 
in terms of similarity (geometric or hypergeometric indexes) to the 
MIPS reference set (this is mainly due to its better recall), while 
TRIBAL offers the best precision in terms of similarity and the best 
performance in terms of containment metrics (meet-min index). 
From the group of overlapping clustering methods, Link-communit-
ies shows better results than <rs type="software">OCG</rs>. </p>

<p>Regarding limitations, the nature of the TRIBAL method leads to a 
small number of predictions. New strategies to solve this limitation 
and address the subcomplex problem will be needed. The possibility 
of replacing the use of templates with clustering algorithms that do 
not find dense modules but functional subunits, or the possibility of 
using clustering algorithms designed for multiple edges, should be 
considered. Another important limitation is the lack of a gold stand-
ard or reference set specifically designed for subcomplexes. 
We have made a thorough analysis of the traditional complex 
prediction pipeline for AP-MS experiments. Besides problems due 
to coverage, false positives and inconsistencies regarding mutual 
pull-down (see Supplementary File), most traditional methods are 
not able to detect subcomplexes due to decisions made in the scoring 
and clustering steps. Based on this knowledge, we have identified the 
best strategies to detect subcomplexes, including the development of 
TRIBAL, a simple strategy that improves the precision of subcom-
plex prediction compared to previous methods. These strategies are 
the initial attempts to specifically address the subcomplex detection 
problem in co-purification data. This paper suggests that overlap-
ping clustering methods fail to detect subcomplexes from AP data 
while the core-attachment model used by <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> and similar 
software seems to be the best option to this date. However, it also 
suggests that alternatives such as the co-purification matrix intro-
duced by TRIBAL deserve more attention, as they show potential 
thanks to a high precision, especially when we evaluate the meet-min 
index, i.e., subcomplexes absolutely contained by larger complexes. 
Finally, research in subcomplex identification demands the genera-
tion of curated gold standards for subcomplexes, which will be an 
important step to achieve a better validation of predictions. </p>

<p>All analyses in this paper were performed using R v.2.15.2 and some of its packages, 
including ''iRefR'' v.1.00 
12 , ''<rs id="software-41" type="software">igraph</rs>'' <rs corresp="#software-41" type="version-number">v.0.64</rs>, and ''<rs id="software-42" type="software">org.Sc.sgd.db</rs>'' <rs corresp="#software-42" type="version-number">v.2.9.1</rs>. All code 
needed to reproduce the following analyses can be found as Supplementary code. </p>

<p>Clustering methods. Link-communities is a method that uses communities of edges 
and not of nodes. <rs type="software">OCG</rs> hierarchically merges edges into modules, checking the value 
of a special modularity function Q. Both <rs type="software">OCG</rs> and Link-communities were 
performed using the ''<rs type="software">linkcomm</rs>'' R package </p>

<p>CACHET. The 369 complexes generated by <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> from Gavin's dataset, were 
retrieved from their web page 
26 . 
In order to generate subcomplexes, we selected all complexes containing both core 
and attachments (i.e., we removed all only-core complexes). Subcomplexes were 
defined as the cores of those core-attachment sets. </p>

<p>. 
The comparison is done through three strategies: Firstly, through a hypergeometric 
test, as defined in eq. (5). In this test, the population is the total number of proteins, 
the population success is the size of the MIPS complex, the sample is the predicted 
complex (predicted either by any combination of the scores and clustering algorithms 
here employed, <rs type="software">CACHET</rs> or TRIBAL) and the success sample is the size of the 
intersection between MIPS and the predicted complex. The overlap is considered 
significant when p-value , 0.05. </p>

<p>TRIBAL algorithm. Both TRIBAL and its evaluations were coded using R 2.15.2 and 
its packages ''<rs type="software">iRefR</rs>'' and ''<rs type="software">igraph</rs>'', and they are available as Supplementary code. </p>

<p>Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">20.0</rs> (IBM 
Corporation, New York, NY). Continuous data were expressed 
as the mean and standard deviation, and categorical data were 
expressed as the number and percentage. The distribution of 
continuous variables among the disease severity groups was 
compared by Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni post hoc 
multiple comparison when the overall test was significant. 
Differences in proportions between groups were examined with 
the Fisher exact test. The association between the sleep 
parameter (ie, AHI) and BP measurements was investigated 
by multivariable linear regression analysis. The AHI values 
were logarithmically transformed (natural log [x þ0.1]) because 
its distribution was skewed and contained zero. Several models 
were constructed to evaluate associations between AHI and BP 
parameters with adjustment for age, sex, height, and adiposity 
(ie, BMI, BMI percentile, and obesity). A P value &lt;0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. </p>

Descriptive statistics were used to display all variables, 
using means and SDs for continuous variables or propor-
tions for categorical variables. Prevalence with 95% CIs 
were calculated using a modified Wald method for 
outcome variables. 
40 χ

to test differences between hospitals for categorical vari-
ables and t-tests or analysis of variance to test differences 
between hospitals for continuous variables.

or side of the cysts and type (functional, simple clear, 
dermoid, endometriosis, cystadenoma, malignant, 
and complicated) were all recorded. Finally, how they 
were managed either by laparoscopy or laparotomy was 
documented. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients admitted 
with a diagnosis of ovarian cysts and managed at

Whole-blood and plasma measurements. Total white blood cell number 
and differential counts were assessed by standard techniques (ACP Diagnostic 
Lab, University of California, San Diego). We measured plasma insulin by 
radioimmunoassay (Linco Research) and determined free fatty acids by 
colorimetric assay (Wako). Plasma cytokines were measured by the core 
laboratories of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Consortium (Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles; LINCOplex assay for Mouse Cytokines, 
http://www.derc.med.ucla.edu/core.htm). Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels were measured by enzymatic methods using an automated bichromatic 
analyzer (Abbot Diagnostics). All of these measurements were performed on 
11 wild-type and 9 ␣4(Y991A) mice for high-fat diet and 6 wild-type and 5 
␣4(Y991A) mice for chow diet (Table 1). 
Histochemistry. Adipose tissue was fixed overnight in 10% formaldehyde, 
dehydrated in ethanol bath, and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained 
with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) for observation of adipose tissue structure. 
Pancreas isolation and determination of islet area. Pancreata were 
isolated and fixed in 4% formalin overnight. Paraffin sections were generated 
and stained with H-E. Pictures were taken of H-E-stained pancreas sections, 
and the area of Langerhans islets and the total area of the pancreas were 
measured using <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">NIH</rs> freeware). Islet area was depicted as 
percentage of total pancreas area. Sections of four to seven mice per group 
and at least six different pancreas areas per mouse were analyzed for 
statistical significance using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. P values 
Ͻ0.05 were considered significant. 
Bone marrow transplantation. We injected bone marrow obtained from 
wild-type and ␣4(Y991A) mice (4 ϫ 10 
6 cells) through the tail vein into male 
C57BL/6 (4 months) and ␣4(Y991A) (4 -6 months) mice that had been 
irradiated (10 Gy) 4 h before. Mice were allowed 4 weeks for reconstitution of 
donor marrow, which we verified by PCR (18). 
Isolation of stromal vascular cells. Epidydimal fat pads were minced in 
PBS and digested with collagenase (Roche) and DNase I (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C. 
Suspensions were then filtered through a 100-m nylon cell strainer and 
then spun at 1,000g for 10 min. The preadipocyte/adipocyte-enriched fraction 
was removed. Isolated stromal vascular cells were resuspended in red blood 
cell lysis buffer (10 mmol/l KHCO 3 , 150 mmol/l NH 4 Cl, and 0.1 mmol/l EDTA, 
pH 8) for 5 min at room temperature. Cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 
min at 500g, and stromal vascular cells were resuspended in PBS at 10 </p>

Flow cytometry. Cells were harvested from WAT, peripheral blood, and bone 
marrow and incubated in Fc blocker (rat anti-mouse CD16/32) for 20 min at 
room temperature. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocya-
nate (FITC)-Ly-6G (1/200) and phycoerythrin (PE)-7/4 (1/50) (BD Biosciences/ 
PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Negative control staining was performed with 
FITC-rat IgG2a/k and PE-rat IgG2a. Cell staining was analyzed with FACScan 
flow cytometer using <rs id="software-1" type="software">CellQuest</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">BD Biosciences Systems</rs>). 
Cell migration assay. Cell migration was assayed in a modified Boyden 
chamber system using a 24-well transwell plate (8-m pore size; Corning) 
coated with 5 g/ml VCAM-1 (R&amp;D Systems). Monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1) (R&amp;D Systems) was added in the lower chamber at 1 
nmol/l. Cells harvested from wild-type or ␣4(Y991A) bone marrow were 
grown for 5-7 days in the presence of granulocyte macrophage-colony-
stimulating factor (5 l of 0.1 mg/ml stock solution). Bone marrow-derived 
macrophages (2 ϫ 10

<p>annotation. For example, Warren et al. 
25 uncovered 
38 895 intergenic open reading frames (ORFs), 
readily identified as putative genes by similarity to 
currently annotated genes, from 1297 prokaryotic 
replicons based on across-genome alignment. New 
genes could be confirmed by the similarity alignment 
or by transcription or proteome analyses. In this work, 
we first used the <rs id="software-1" type="software">ZCURVE</rs> 
26 program, which is freely 
available at <rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/Zcurve_B</rs>/, to pick

<p>3.4. Disrupted ORFs 
During the process of genome re-annotation for the 
10 Neisseriaceae strains, we found an interesting phe-
nomenon. In a specific genome, two adjacent ORFs, 
which are predicted as genes by the <rs type="software">ZCURVE</rs> 
program, have the same function with known genes 
in the other species. The total length of the two 
ORFs just corresponds to that of the known counter-
parts or just a little different from them. Based on 
similarity scores, both of the two ORFs should be pre-
dicted as genes with the corresponding function. 
However, either of them is much shorter than the 
functional counterpart and could not constitute a 
homologue in the sense of length information. 
Perrodou et al. 
43 stated that unrecognized frameshifts, 
in-frame stop codons and sequencing errors often led 
to interrupted coding sequences. Very recently, 
Sharma et al. 
44 performed a pilot study on bacterial 
genes with disrupted ORFs. Their results indicated 
that many disrupted genes likely utilized the non-
standard decoding mechanisms: programmed riboso-
mal frameshifting and programmed transcriptional 
realignment. Given that our recognized adjacent 
ORFs have identical functions, they should originate 
from the disruption of a longer gene by a frameshift 
or an in-frame stop codon and rarely by the sequen-
cing error. Numbers of disrupted ORFs are listed 
in Table 3 and details of them are illustrated in 
Supplementary Table S4. Totally, 111 disrupted 
ORFs (or partial genes) were identified in six strains 
of the genus Neisseria and two in L. hongkongensis. </p>

<p>We should note that there still probably are non-
coding ORFs and missed genes after the present 
updated annotation in the 10 Neisseriaceae strains. 
To assure reliable results, we picked up only those 
sequences with very higher similarities when identify-
ing missed genes and we used the method with lower 
specificity when excluding non-coding ORFs. In add-
ition, some thoroughly new genes, which have not sig-
nificant similarities with any known genes, may be 
found by combing ab initio programme and wet ex-
perimental validation. However, the 106 newly 
found genes are those having similar counterparts 
based on latest databases. Also note that different 
detailed methods may be used to check the annota-
tions of the other bacterial genomes, although the 
present systematic method has shown to be effective 
and reliable. For example, the recently developed ab 
initio gene finder <rs type="software">Prodigal</rs>, 
32 which has lower false 
positives could replace or jointly used with <rs id="software-6" type="software">ZCURVE</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">1.0</rs>. Here, we used only the latter because the use of 
both of them generates basically consistent results 
(data not shown). The <rs type="software">RPGM</rs> program, 
39 which is 
also based on the graphical representation of the 
DNA sequence, could be chosen as an alternative to 
eliminate non-coding ORFs. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis of the data was performed 
using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences

<p>apparent that typical effect sizes for individual single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were fairly small, so large 
sample sizes would be required for reliable gene mapping. 
This has encouraged collaboration between individual re-
search groups and led to the formation of consortia to pool 
the results of GWASs using meta-analysis techniques. Pro-
gress has been facilitated by the availability of phased haplo-
type training sets (notably, from the HapMap project: http 
://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/phasing) and the ac-
companying genotype imputation software (for example, 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">MACH</rs>: <rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html</rs> 
or <rs id="software-1" type="software">IMPUTE</rs>: <rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html</rs>). 
These population genetic resources and statistical genetic 
tools provide an efficient solution to the fact that individual 
GWASs are often carried out on different SNP arrays with 
variable SNP overlap.

cation of two papers from the CARDIoGRAM (3) and C4D (4)

by questionnaire. All the panoramic radio-
graphs were taken with PM 2002 CC appara-
tus (Planmeca Oy, Asentajankatu 6, 00880 
Helsinki, Finland) by a single operator (AB). 
The position of the head was standardized as 
much as possible and also the exposure factors 
(kVp, mA) were regulated for each patient. To 
have similar density and contrast in all radio-
graphs, we used both AGFA Dentus panoram-
ic film (Heraeus Kulzer, Belgium) and Kodak 
screens (Kodak Lanex Regular Screen, East-
man Kodak Company, USA). Processing of 
the films was automatically performed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">Pro-

bone mineral density, DXA (Dual Energy X-
ray Absorptiometry) scans were performed 
with Osteocore 2 (MEDILINK, France). This 
technique is widely accepted as the "gold 
standard" method of clinical bone mineral 
measurements [9,10]. DXA itself is subject to 
some minor inaccuracy in BMD measurement 
[6]. Precision of DXA ranges from 0.55 to 5% 
[11]. 
Sixty-seven panoramic radiographs were ana-
lyzed for MCI, MI and PMI. According to Jo-

<p>Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. All DNA 
samples were assessed for integrity, quantity and purity by elec-
trophoresis in a 1.3% agarose gel, picogreen quantification, 
and nanodrop measurements. All samples were randomly dis-
tributed into 96 well plates. Bisulfite conversion of 500 ng of 
genomic DNA was performed using EZ DNA methylation kit 
(Zymo Research) following manufacturer's instructions. 200 ng 
of bisulfite converted DNA were used for hybridization on the 
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). Briefly, samples 
were whole genome amplified followed by an enzymatic end-
point fragmentation, precipitation and resuspension. The resus-
pended samples were hybridized onto the beadchip for 16 h at 
48°C and washed. A single nucleotide extension with labeled 
dideoxy-nucleotides was performed and repeated rounds of stain-
ing were applied with a combination of labeled antibodies dif-
ferentiating between biotin and DNP.

<p>regression analyses. The results are presented as mean±st-

evaluated by χ 2 analysis and Fisher's exact test. A p-value with 
three decimal places was taken to indicate statistically signifi-
cant differences between statin-free and statin-treated sub-
jects of the study. Associations between clinical variables, such 
as age, BMI, and TC, were analyzed by Pearson correlation 
test. All analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 18.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). </p>

<p>Samples of ECM materials were rinsed in Dulbecco's PBS 
(pH 7.4). Samples (25-30 mg) were hermetically sealed in 
aluminum crucibles. Thermograms were recorded using dif-
ferential scanning calorimeter (Model Q2000; TA Instruments, 
New Castle, DE) from 2°C to 125°C at various heating rates 
between 0.02°C/min and 50°C/min. After calorimetric meas-
urement, small holes were punched on sealed crucibles with a 
pin, and the dry mass of samples was measured after dehydra-
tion between 105°C and 110°C under vacuum overnight. 
Thermograms were analyzed using the software <rs id="software-0" type="software">Universal 
Analysis 2000</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 4.5</rs>) to determine the onset tempera-
ture (T d ) and enthalpy (ΔΗ) of collagen denaturation. </p>

<p>risk categories based on PF5 and BNP levels measured during 
the mean 30-month follow-up period: low risk (0% to &lt;10%), 
intermediate risk (10% to 20%), or high risk (&gt;20%). PTX3 was 
subsequently used to reclassify the risk category for ascer-
taining whether there would be improvement in the NRI. The 
NRI was calculated using the following equation: NRI=([number 
of events reclassified as higherÀnumber of events reclassified 
as lower]/number of events)À([number of nonevents reclas-
sified as lowerÀnumber of nonevents reclassified as higher]/

<p>Interventions were placed into natural groupings decided 
before inspection of the results and agreed with clinical 
experts: 
1. more supported (six or more contacts, or 6 or more weeks 
in duration), 
2. less supported (fewer than six contacts or fewer than 
6 weeks in duration). 
Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects 
model where studies were judged appropriately homoge-
neous. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 
2 statistic. All 
continuous data were presented using a mean difference with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) and time to event outcomes 
were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) to account for varying 
lengths of follow-up. Follow-up time was converted to weeks. 
The results of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ) were multiplied by -1 so that positive differences 
equated to improved HRQoL. Where HRs were not reported, 
methods by Parmar et al 
18 and Perneger 
19 were used. Rates 
of admissions and ED visits (ie, where patients could have 
multiple events) were calculated under the assumption that 
all patients in both arms were followed up for the duration 
of the study and that the rates were constant over time. All 
data analyses were undertaken using <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">12</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">StataCorp LP</rs>, College Station, TX, USA). </p>

<p>Audio recordings were professionally transcribed. Data were 
coded using <rs type="software">Dedoose</rs> software. Researchers McDonald and 
Popova independently blind-coded a subset of transcripts, which 
were then compared to develop coding guidelines. Researchers 
created code definitions and developed a consistent coding 
scheme to ensure that codes were applied consistently. The 
larger set of transcripts was divided and coded independently. 
Themes were generated iteratively during review of coded tran-
scripts. Memos summarising each theme with illustrative quotes 
were reviewed by authors and discussed iteratively to reach con-
sensus and theme saturation. Pseudonyms are used for all parti-

<p>21 The Palma index thus is an alternative approach to measuring income inequality which is more sensitive 
than the Gini index to changes occurring at the top and at the bottom of the distribution (Palma 2011; Cobham

22 In order to study the statistical significance of the computed indexes, we used the Stata commands "digini" 
and "dientropy" contained in the DASP package (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Abdelkrim and Duclos</rs> 2007). The Gini and the Theil

<p>MRI was performed using a horizontal bore 7T small 
animal MRI instrument (PharmaScan; Bruker Corpo-

mouse bed and head coil. DCE-MRI data were 
obtained with a T1-weighted FLASH sequence (Fast 
Low Angle Shot) with a flip angle of 25°, repetition 
time and echo time of 13.77 and 2.52 ms respectively. 
A total of 600-1200 axial images through the mas-
seter muscle were acquired with a sampling interval of 
0.99 s, with a slice thickness of 1 mm, field of view of 
2.5 cm and acquisition matrix of 96 9 96. 
A separate group of animals (n = 9) was used to 
determine the signal over time in large supplying ves-

<p>Statistical analysis 
All data presented in this paper are the actual 
untransformed data except log-transformed data used for 
bacterial count when necessary to best approximate the 
normal distribution. Except for mortality, all data were 
analysed using the one-way ANOVA. Mortality data were 
analysed by chi-square test. Significant means were then 
elucidated using the Duncan multiple range tests. All 
statistical tests were conducted at 95% confidence level 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> program (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 6.0</rs>, SAS Institute Inc, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2003</rs>).

<p>After the best model was selected, psychosocial factors were

were performed with nonparametric statistics, χ²-tests (for cat-

When the tests produced significant differences, post hoc 
analyses with Bonferroni tests were used to examine these 
differences. The level of significance was set to α=0.05, and

<p>placing the optimal nucleotide sequences beforehand. It 
was also expected that such a stimulatory sequence could 
be used as a universal translation enhancer to increase the 
productivity of recombinant proteins. In search of the nucle-
otide sequences that possibly enhance the expression of 
their fusion partners, the <rs type="software">python</rs> script was used to analyze 
the codon usage in the entire E.coli genome. Interestingly, 
it was found that the nucleotide sequences of many signal 
peptides had strong bias for AAA as the second codon. 
Approximately 40% of signal peptides had the AAA triplet 
as the second codon (Table 2). 
According to the analysis reported by Sato et al. (21), 
&gt;10% of the E.coli genes use AAA as their second codon 
whereas the frequency of AAA triplet in the entire E.coli 
genome is 3.3%. It was also suggested that the higher fre-
quency of the AAA triplet at the +2 position is related to 
the translation efficiency of a gene. Therefore, from the 
exceptionally high frequency of the AAA triplet as the second 
codon, it was assumed that the signal sequences might work 
as a translation-enhancing element. 
Therefore, the genes of hEPO with different signal 
sequences were fused and experiments were carried out to 
determine if their presence affects the efficiency of protein 
synthesis in our cell-free synthesis system. The nucleotide 
sequences of the seven different signal peptides (pelBss, 
ompAss, phoAss, malEss, ompCss, ompTss, heposs) were 
fused to the upstream of hEPO sequence in the plasmid 
pK7hEPO, and the resulting constructs were expressed in 
the reaction mixture for cell-free protein synthesis. As 
summarized in Table 3, the five signal sequences except for 
ompTss and heposs dramatically enhanced the expression 
level, yielding 9-10 times higher amounts of the target 
proteins (Figure 2). For example, the expression level of </p>

<p>To confirm whether the colonies represented homogenous species, we sequenced additional colonies from 
the agar plates randomly. For identification of the isolated culture, sequencing of the conserved genomic 
region was carried out using standard primer pair for the amplification (sequencing service was provided 
by Amnion Biosciences Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru, India). The amplicon used for the identification was 18S 
ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence; internal transcribed spacer 1 and 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene, 
complete sequence; and internal transcribed spacer 2, partial sequence. The 488-base pair amplicon 
sequence was then searched for the similarity in US National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI) nucleotide collection database using the Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (<rs type="software">BLASTN</rs>) 
using standard search parameters [32]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed later using first 10 hits from 
NCBI <rs type="software">BLASTN</rs> search results and the query sequence using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis 
version 4.1 [33]. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbour-joining method. The bootstrap 
consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa 
analysed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in &lt;50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. 
The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 
replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same 
units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances 
were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of 
base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the 
dataset (Complete Deletion option). There were a total of 365 positions in the final dataset. </p>

<p>We used linear regression analysis to test the associations between selected independent variables (fungal 
status, and eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages) and forced midexpiratory flow (FEF25-75%) 
% predicted as the dependent variable. All linear regression models also took into account the covariates 
age, smoking status (current versus former or never) and duration of employment. In addition to testing 
models in which only one of the independent predictors of interest was included along with the adjusting 
covariates, we also tested models including both fungal status and either eosinophil or lymphocyte 
percentage in the same model. We did so in order to assess the potential mediation of any fungal 
association with lung function by the presence of sputum eosinophils or lymphocytes. Because sputum 
eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages were strongly correlated with one another (r=0.72, p&lt;0.01) and 
both inversely correlated with the percent of macrophages (r= −0.63 and r= −0.55, respectively; both 
p&lt;0.01), we did not include any of these in multivariate models. Eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages, 
however, were only weakly negatively correlated with the percent neutrophils (r= −0.22 ( p&lt;0.05) and 
r= −0.24 ( p&lt;0.10), respectively), allowing us to test whether inclusion of that variable had a substantive 
impact on the mediation by eosinophils of the association of fungal contamination with lung function. All 
analyses were performed using <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">version 20</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">IBM Corp.</rs>., Armonk, NY, USA). </p>

<p>Out of the targeted population of 79 males, we did not study those who did not provide consent (n=7), 
did not include those ineligible based on current antibiotic use (n=4) and excluded those without 
reproducible quality spirometry (n=8) or who were unable to expectorate adequate sputum samples (n=6). 
We ultimately analysed data for 54 (68%) wood process workers employed at the four targeted worksites. 
Of those studied, 19 (35%) produced a sputum sample in which fungus was detected, while 35 (65%) were 
sputum fungus negative. In the genomic fungal characterisation, hits generated using standard search 
parameters indicated the fungus belonged to the genus Candida. A phylogenetic tree constructed from the 
hits of NCBI <rs type="software">BLASTN</rs> search results is presented in figure 1. The sequence has been submitted to NCBI 
database and can be accessed through the accession number GenBank KF483576.1. Fungus was not 
detected in saliva sample stains or cultures (figure 1). </p>

<p>The data were expressed as mean ± SD values using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC, USA). Each experimental set was compared 
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's

<p>Illumina pipeline analyzed short reads were uniquely 
aligned allowing at best two mismatches to the UCSC (The 
Genome Sequencing Consortium) human genome version 
hg18, using the program <rs type="software">BOWTIE</rs> (19). Peak caller algo-
rithm <rs id="software-14" type="software">MACS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-14" type="version-number">version 1.4</rs>) was used to determine enriched 
peak region with parameters: -nomodel, -tsize = 46, -bw = 
300. Shift size were determined using <rs type="software">Pyicos</rs> (20) strand cor-
relation method. Enriched peaks were annotated to near-
est <rs id="software-16" type="software">EnsEMBL</rs> (21) gene (EnsEMBL Biomart <rs corresp="#software-16" type="version-number">version 54</rs>) 
using Bioconductor package <rs type="software">ChIPpeakAnno</rs> (22). Distri-
bution of enriched reads along the genomes and transcrip-
tion start site (TSS) of RefSeq genes were determined using 
<rs type="software">CEAS</rs> (23). Data from ChIP-seq experiments have been de-
posited in GEO (accession number GSE93975). </p>

<p>To determine the over-represented short sequence motifs in 
enriched peaks, we used total 100nt sequences (from peak 
summit, 50 bp down and 50 bp up). We used top 1000 
peaks (based on fold change) for finding motifs using both 
<rs type="software">WEEDER</rs> (24) and <rs type="software">MEME</rs> (25) programs. </p>

<p>Functional annotation of target genes is based on Gene 
Ontology (GO) (26) Consortium, 2000; (http://www. 
geneontology.org) as extracted from <rs type="software">EnsEMBL</rs> (21) and 
KEGG pathway database (27). Accordingly, all genes are 
classified into the ontology categories biological process 
(GOBP) and pathways when possible. We have taken only 
the GO/pathway categories that have at least 10 genes an-
notated. We used <rs id="software-22" type="software">Gitools</rs> for enrichment analysis and heat 
map generation (28) (<rs corresp="#software-22" type="url">http://www.gitools.org</rs>). Resulting P-
values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Ben-
jamin and Hochberg's method of False Discovery Rate (29). 
Enrichment analysis was also performed using the public 
DAVID tools (Database for Annotation, visualization and 
integrated discovery v 6.7) (<rs corresp="#software-23" type="url">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov</rs>) 
(30). </p>

<p>Possible occurrence of TF motifs in peak regions (150 bp 
around peak summit) and overrepresentation of these TFs 
is based on the tool <rs type="software">Pscan</rs> (32) with parameter: mixed back-
ground hg18, TRANSFAC matrix. Pscan evaluates local 
enrichment, comparing with a t-test mean and standard de-
viation of the score of the best matching oligonucleotides in 
the input regions to mean and standard deviation of the best 
match in the genomic regions flanking the input ones. Local 
enrichment can be used to identify motifs with significant 
preference for binding within the regions, that is, the mo-
tif corresponding to the ChIP'ed TF, as well as other TFs 
likely to interact with it and binding in its neighborhood. 
Local enrichment P-value (L.PV): describing whether the 
motif is over-or underrepresented in the 150 bp input re-
gions with respect to the genomic regions flanking them, 
indicating whether the motif is overrepresented. </p>

<p>Overlap of genomic position range data was done using 
<rs type="software">BedTools</rs> (33) and significance of overlap was analyzed by 
Hypergeometric test. However, Venn-diagram generation 
and overlap of target genes analysis was performed using 
in-house R programming language script. Significance of 
overlap calculated based on Chi-square test. Unless stated, 
peak overlap is defined as overlap by at least 1 bp. </p>

<p>Asynchronously growing HCT116 cells were washed with 
PBS and RNA was isolated from 3 different sets of cells 
transfected with shRNA control or shRNAPCAF. To-
tal RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, 
Iberia, Madrid, Spain). RNA quality control was done with 
Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Samples were then hybridized 
with Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Dataset ob-
tained by Expression Console (Affymetrix) were analyzed 
by DNA-ChIP Analyzer (dChIP) software and tools. The 
normalization of the arrays was performed using the ro-
bust multi-array average (RMA) method as implemented in 
the Affymetrix package of R bioconductor. Quality control 
measurements were obtained with ArrayQualityMetrics, 
while the statistical analysis of significant hits with <rs type="software">Limma</rs> 
(35). Data from expression microarray experiments have 
been deposited in GEO (accession number GSE93694). </p>

<p>Later, those 15 positive dogs were subjected to a nested-PCR with 
outer pair previously used

TACACC-3´) and VAN2 (5´-GCGACACGTTATGTG AGCCG-3´) to 
amplify an internal region (280 to 330 bp) of the fragment as described 
by CRUZ et al. in 2013

was performed with forward and reverse primers; using the Big-
Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit V3.1 and the 
automated sequencer "3730 DNA analyzer" (Applied Biosystems, Foster 
City, CA). Sequences obtained were analyzed and edited using <rs id="software-0" type="software">BioEdit</rs>

with the exception of neonates and children requiring imme-
diate emergency resuscitation at presentation. A triage nurse 
recorded vital signs prior to assessment by emergency depart-
ment clinical staff. All clinical data including investigations, 
management and fi nal diagnoses were directly entered onto a 
standard proforma. Completed proformas were then scanned 
using <rs type="software">Formic</rs> electronic data capture software to minimise 
data entry errors. Study clinicians checked the data for com-
pleteness, resolved data gaps and inconsistencies by re-review 
of the clinical notes, and recorded additional clinical data on 
children who were admitted. Children who re-attended hos-
pital within 1 week of discharge from either the emergency 
department or the ward were identifi ed from the electronic 
patient register, their notes reviewed, and fi nal diagnoses and 
SBI classifi cation amended in the light of their second pre-
sentation. A consultant paediatrician re-reviewed the patient 
records of all those admitted to check the accuracy of the data, 
particularly in relation to the fi nal diagnosis recorded. 
Children were eligible for inclusion in this analysis if their 
differential diagnosis at presentation included acute infection. 
We excluded from the analysis children for whom data were 
insuffi cient to confi dently assign outcome, or who had missing 
dates of birth. </p>

and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) and positive and 
negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR−) were reported for each 
variable. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses. Required sample size for association 
studies was calculated using QUANTO (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 1.2</rs>, Uni-
versity of Southern California) and a power 40.80 is 
acceptable. The evaluation of distribution differences of 
selected variables and alleles of the TERT rs2736100 and 
rs2736098 between CHB patients and healthy controls were 
done using χ 
2 test. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of the 
genotype distribution among the controls was tested by a 
goodness-of-fit χ 
2 test. Unconditional univariate and multi-
variate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate 
ORs for risk of CHB or LC and their 95% CIs. The LTL 
difference between patients and healthy controls was 
assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-tests. All the tests 
were computed using SigmaStat3.1 software (Systat Soft-
ware, Inc., Richmond, CA, USA). For comparison of 
rs2736098 and rs2736100 genotypes between healthy 
controls and CHB patients, P values were adjusted by 
Bonferroni correction and a statistical significance should be 
o0.025. P values of o0.05 were considered as statistically 
significant for all other comparisons. </p>

and divided by the total area of the muscle section (n = 3

<p>We stratified by race and gender, and ran separate analyses. 
The effect is expressed in terms of the average number of years 
of life that would have been saved (or lost), among the exposed 
cases, under an intervention banning exposure to the corre-
sponding type of metalworking fluid without intervening on the 
exposures to the other fluid types. 
We also used stratified g-estimation models to assess if syn-
thetic exposure caused people to leave work differentially by 
race and gender.

<p>RNA extraction and northern blot analysis. Total RNA was 
extracted from tissue using TRIzol method as per the manufac-
turer's instructions (T9424; Sigma-Aldrich). Northern blots were 
prepared using 20 μg total RNA. Appropriate probes [partial 
for OsSOS1(AK065608) corresponding to its N-terminal part 
and full length for other genes; OsSOS2 (AK102270); OsSOS3 
(AK101368); OsTOC1 (AK111828)] were amplified using the 
primers listed in Table 1 and radiolabeled using the DecaLabel™ 
DNA labeling kit, (K0621; Fermentas). To avoid any error due to 
unequal loading of RNA samples, same blot was re-probed each 
time with different gene probes after washing. Northern blots 
were hybridized at 65°C in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 
0.1% SDS and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 
16-18 h. Membrane was washed twice in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS 
and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at 65°C and scanned 
on phosphorimager using the software <rs type="software">Fujifilm Image Reader</rs>. 
The relative transcript abundance was calculated using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">Image

<p>All data was analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 15.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL). The chi-square test was used to compare stroke 
risk factors and subtypes between cancer patients who had expe-
rienced one ischemic stroke and those who had experienced more 
than one. A student's t-test was used to compare biomarkers be-
tween the two groups. P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. </p>

<p>individual mean concentrations were recorded. The intraassay 
and day-to-day analytic coefficients of variation were less than 
5% for each analyte (Table S1). 
Statistics. The plasma concentrations of Kyn and Trp, as 
well as Kyn/Trp ratios approximated a parametric distribution. 
Therefore, data were presented as means ± SD. Due to the small 
sample size, the associations between serum biomarker levels and 
clinicopathologic variables were evaluated with Wilcoxon rank-
sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Wilcoxon signed rank was used to 
compare between time points. Correlation was estimated using 
Spearman's rho. Survival curves were calculated according to the 
Kaplan-Meier method. To address the experimental hypothesis, 
the statistical population was equally divided into "hig" and 
"low" patients using the median Kyn/Trp value as pre-specified 
cut-point. The effects of biomarkers on PFS and OS were evalu-
ated using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and Cox proportional-
hazards regression models. All tests performed were two-tailed. 
Statistical analysis was performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 8.0</rs>). Figures and survival plots were generated using <rs id="software-1" type="software">GraphPad

<p>Results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean 
(SEM), and n indicated the number of arteries. The concen-
tration curve for U-46619 was expressed as percentages of 
contraction relative to 120 mM KCl. Relaxation values were 
expressed as the percentage change from the U-46619-induced 
contraction. To obtain relaxation values for the encapsulated 
formulations, the relaxation values of empty liposomes were 
subtracted from the respective liposomal iloprost formulation. 
Multigroup comparisons were performed with a one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA), with either Tukey's or Dun-
nett's (for comparisons to a control group) post hoc test, as 
appropriate. Comparison between two groups was performed 
with a Student's t-test. <rs id="software-0" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA</rs>) was used. Values of P0.05 were

<p>comparative genomics relies on implicit or explicit models 
for the evolution of morphology (Stevens 1991; Felsenstein 
2002; Ronquist 2004; Harmon et al. 2010; O'Meara 2012), 
many of which make gross simplifying assumptions about 
how traits vary over time. Continuous evolutionary models 
have been used in comparative transcriptomics to study her-
itable aspects of gene expression levels (Khaitovich et al. 2005, 
2006), an area with exceptional promise given recent im-
provements in accuracy and the ability to sample in situ 
(Voelckel et al. 2002). 
Continuous trait models will be of growing importance in 
evolutionary studies of whole-genome single nucleotide poly-
morphism-databases. Inference methods based on the coales-
cent such as <rs type="software">SNAPP</rs> (Bryant et al. 2012) do not scale well as 
the number of individuals grows, while those based on con-
tinuous models of gene frequencies (Cavalli-Sforza and 
Edwards 1967; Felsenstein 1981b; Siré n et al. 2011) depend 
only on proportions of populations with each allele, so scale 
extremely well. In addition, it is often easier to model the 
effect of selection on continuous gene frequency models 
than with the coalescent. Continuous evolutionary models 
have also been applied successfully to the study of ancestral 
geography distributions (Lemey et al. 2010). 
Our interest is in developing techniques used to compute 
with these models, and to expand the range of models we can </p>

<p>2 Þ convergence irrespective of 
dimension. This has been critical when computing the likeli-
hoods of complex evolutionary models with as many dimen-
sions as there are nodes in the phylogeny. 
The main contribution of our article is to demonstrate how 
to efficiently and accurately compute likelihoods on a phylog-
eny using a sequence of one-dimensional integrations. We 
obtain a fast algorithm with convergence guarantees that 
far exceed what can be obtained by Monte Carlo integration. 
Our approach combines two standard tools: classical numer-
ical integrators and Felsenstein's pruning algorithm for dis-
crete characters (Felsenstein 1981a). Indeed, the only real 
difference between our approach and Felsenstein's discrete 
character algorithm is that we use numerical integration tech-
niques to integrate states at ancestral nodes, instead of just 
carrying out a summation. 
The running time of the algorithm is OðN 
2 nÞ, where N is 
the number of points used in the numerical integration at 
each node and n is the number of taxa (leaves) in the tree. 
Using Simpson's method, we obtain a convergence rate of 
OðnN 
À4 Þ, meaning that if we increase N by a factor of 10, we 
will obtain an estimate which is accurate to four more decimal 
places. 
To illustrate the application of our general framework, we 
develop an efficient algorithm for computing the likelihood 
of a tree under the threshold model of Wright (1934) 
and Felsenstein (2005, 2012). We also show how to infer 
marginal trait densities at ancestral nodes. We have imple-
mented these algorithms and used them to study evolution 
of extrafloral nectaries (EFN) on an 839-taxon phylogeny of 
Marazzi et al. (2012). <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> code for computing the 
threshold likelihood has been posted on <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> Central 
and complete <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> code for all analyses and simulations 
can be found in supplementary material, Supplementary 
Material online. 
The combination of numerical integrators and the pruning 
algorithm opens up a large range of potential models and </p>

<p>Marazzi et al. (2012) describe AIC comparisons between their 
precursor model and a conventional binary trait model. We 
extend this comparison to include the threshold model. This is 
a one parameter model, the parameter being the value of the 
liability at the root. We used the <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> command <rs type="software">fmin-
search</rs> with multiple starting points to compute the maximum 
likelihood estimate for this value. The resulting log-likelihood 
was log?L ¼ À240:6, giving an AIC of 483.2. This compares 
to an AIC of 507.4 for the (two parameter) binary character 
model and an AIC of 495.4 for the (one parameter) precursor 
model of Marazzi et al. (2012). 
We analyzed the five other EFN traits in the same way, and 
present the computed AIC values in table 1, together with AIC 
values for the two parameter binary state model and one pa-
rameter precursor model computed by Marazzi et al. (2012) 
(and the two parameter precursor model for trait 6). We see </p>

<p>Fluorochrome labeling was performed using calcein (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) 20 mg/kg body weight admin-
istered intraperitoneally on days 9 and 2 before the rats were 
euthanized. Undecalcified left rat femurs were embedded in 
polymethyl methacrylate (Sigma-Aldrich) and sectioned at a 
thickness of 9 μm using a microtome (Leica RM2235, Nuss-
loch, German). Sections to be used for evaluation of bone struc-
ture were stained using the Von Kossa method, while unstained 
sections were used for assessment of bone dynamics. 
The region assessed was the secondary spongiosa in 
the metaphyseal region, which is 3-7 mm from the lowest 
point of the growth plate and 1 mm from the lateral cortex. 
Structural parameters were investigated by an automated 
method using an image analyzer (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">MediaCybernetics</rs> <rs id="software-2" type="software">Image

investigated using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 
80i, Tokyo, Japan) and measured manually using a Weibel

bone volume, thickness, number, and separation. Dynamic 
parameters measured included single-labeled surface,

<p>Task protocol. Participants completed a task of implicit 
facial emotion processing comprising eight blocks of happy 
faces, eight blocks of fearful faces, eight blocks of neutral 
faces and eight blocks of fixation crosses. Facial stimuli were 
from an established battery of emotional faces, 
31 and 
comprised eight different facial identities expressing happy, 
fearful and neutral expressions (that is, 24 faces in total). 
Stimuli were presented in a blocked design in one of two 
pseudorandom orders (which were counterbalanced across 
all participants in each study group) and were presented in 
e-Prime <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">version 2.0</rs> Professional (Psychological Software 
Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Each block lasted 20 s and 
comprised four stimuli presented for 4 s each with an 
interstimulus interval of 1 s. Blocks were separated by a 2 s 
interblock interval. During task conditions (happy, fearful and 
neutral faces) participants were required to press one of 
two buttons to indicate the gender of the face using a 
button box held in the right hand. During fixation blocks, 
the participants were required to stare passively at a 
fixation cross. As with the facial blocks, four fixation cross 
stimuli were presented for 4 s each with an interstimulus 
interval of 1 s. </p>

<p>Imaging data. Preprocessing and first-level analyses were 
performed in SPM<rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">8</rs> (Wellcome Department of Cognitive 
Neurology, London, UK) implemented using the automatic 
analysis platform as previously described 
32 (Medical Research 
Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK) 
according to the standard Medical Research Council Cogni-
tion and Brain Sciences Unit pipeline comprising sinc 
interpolation to correct for the acquisition of different brain 
slices at different times, coregistration of echo planar imaging 
and structural scans, normalization to Montreal Neurological 
Institute (MNI) space 
33 and smoothing using a Gaussian 
kernel of 10 mm full width at half maximum. For each 
subject, fMRI responses were modeled using a canonical 
hemodynamic response function and the general linear model 
was used to perform a first level, within-participants analysis 
on the functional data from each subject individually for the 
primary contrasts (happy minus neutral and fearful minus 
neutral faces), with spatial realignment parameters entered as 
covariates. </p>

<p>To characterize the patterns of activation within the brain in 
the three participant groups, the first-level contrast images for 
each study group were taken through to a second-level 
analysis using a random-effects model, with age and sex 
specified as covariates. Group-level activation maps were 
generated with a global threshold set at Po0.05 following 
correction for multiple comparisons on a whole-brain level 
family-wise error (FWE) basis, and with a cluster extent (k E ) 
threshold set at 20 voxels. In the same way, all activation 
results quoted (Table 1) are after the whole-brain level FWE 
correction for multiple comparisons and k E threshold of 
20 voxels. 
To investigate possible biomarkers of familial risk as com-
pared with autism versus control differences, we examined 
between-group differences in the fMRI response in autism, 
sibling and control participants within the specific brain regions 
identified as being significantly activated in the control group. We 
therefore defined our regions of interest as the clusters of FWE 
corrected Po0.05 significant activation within the control group 
activation maps (Table 1), and used <rs type="software">MarsBar</rs> 
34 to extract mean 
activations for the primary contrast (happy minus neutral and 
fearful minus neutral) for each subject for each region of interest. 
For illustration, we plotted these FWE corrected activation 
maps onto the canonical Montreal Neuroimaging Institute 
(MNI) 152 template brain image 
33 using <rs id="software-9" type="software">SPM</rs><rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">8</rs>, and onto a 
three-dimensional-rendered template brain image using <rs id="software-10" type="software">MRI-

<p>We conducted analyses of variance within <rs id="software-11" type="software">PASW Statistics</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-11" type="version-number">18</rs> to measure the overall effect of group on the primary 
contrast activation data (happy minus neutral and fearful 
minus neutral) for each region of interest. Age and sex were 
modeled as covariates in all analyses. Similarly, we used 
analyses of variance to investigate autism versus control, 
control versus sibling and autism versus sibling differences, 
again taking age and sex as covariates. We investigated 
linear trend effects across the three groups using polynomial 
regression, and where a statistically significant linear effect 
was found, we examined the quadratic effect to confirm that 
this was nonsignificant. We plotted the mean activation 
contrast estimate (expressed in arbitrary units ± standard 
error of the mean) for the three study groups. 
To investigate whether the atypical response to happy 
versus neutral faces was driven by an atypical response to 
happy or neutral faces, or to both, we examined the response 
to faces versus fixation crosses. First-level analysis was as 
above, taking the primary contrasts as happy and neutral 
faces versus fixation crosses. Second-level statistical analy-
sis proceeded as described above for the emotional versus 
neutral contrasts. </p>

CaCl 2 , pH 7.4 (NMDG), in the pipette solution, and 130 NMDG-Asp,

an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and acquired with 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Pulse and Patchmaster</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">HEKA</rs>). Patch pipettes were pulled 
from borosilicate glass, fire-polished to a resistance of 0.5-1 MΩ, and 
covered in dental wax to reduce linear capacitive currents. 
Macroscopic currents were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz and sam-
pled at 15 kHz. For macroscopic current recordings, the follow-
ing voltage protocol was used: patches were held at 90 mV, and 
voltage was stepped from 70 to 90 mV in 10-mV increments for 
100 ms before being changed back to 90 mV for 100 ms. All 
macroscopic current recordings are the average of 10 current 
traces to reduce noise. For leak subtraction, a P/5 protocol was 
applied from a leak holding potential of 120 mV. 
The first 100 µs of the tail current were averaged and divided by 
the largest tail current value in the set of traces to yield a normal-
ized current that is directly proportional to the open probability, 
P o . The voltage dependence of the normalized tail currents was 
fitted to a fourth-power Boltzmann function: </p>

<p>stores. The question is important because relatively few retail transactions take place 
online. In fact, according to Euromonitor (2014), online purchases are currently less 
than 10 percent of all retail transactions in the United States, and even lower in other 
countries. 
This paper provides the first large-scale comparison of online and offline prices 
in large multi-channel retailers designed to answer this question. Using a combina-
tion of crowdsourcing platforms, a mobile phone app, and web scraping methods, I 
simultaneously collected prices in both the online and offline stores of 56 of the larg-
est retailers in 10 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, 
Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States. These data are used to 
compare price levels, the behavior of price changes, and the selection of products 
available for sale in the offline and online stores. I document country, sector, and 
retailer heterogeneity, and test whether online prices vary with IP address locations 
or persistent browsing habits. The results have implications for NSOs and research-
ers using online data, as well as those interested in the effect of the Internet on retail 
prices. 
The data collection effort is unprecedented in scope and size, and was carried 
out as part of the BPP. I first selected the retailers to be sampled by focusing on 
the top 20 companies by market shares in each country that sell both online and 
offline (" multi-channel"), and have product barcodes that can be matched across 
samples. Next, I used crowdsourcing platforms such as <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Amazon</rs> <rs id="software-1" type="software">Mechanical Turk</rs>, 
<rs type="software">Elance</rs>, and <rs type="software">UpWork</rs> to hire 323 workers to collect the offline data. Each worker 
was assigned a simple task: to scan the barcodes and collect prices for a random set 
of 10 to 50 products in any physical store of a given retailer. In some cases they had 
to return to the same store multiple times to scan the same set of products. Using 
a special app for android phones developed to simplify and standardize the data 
collection process, these workers scanned each product's barcode, manually entered 
the price, took a photo of the price tag, and sent all the information via e-mail to the 
BPP servers, where it was automatically processed and cleaned. A scraping software 
then used the barcode numbers to look for the same product in the website of each 
retailer, and collected the online price within a period of seven days. The matched 
online-offline dataset contains prices for more than 24,000 products and 38,000 
observations sampled between December 2014 and March 2016. 
The main finding is that online and offline price levels are identical about 72 per-
cent of the time, with significant heterogeneity at the country, sector, and retailer 
level. These percentages range from 42 percent in Brazil to 91 percent in Canada 
and the United Kingdom. The United States is close to the average, with 69 percent. 
At the sector level, drugstores and office-product retailers have the lowest share of 
identical prices, with 38 percent and 25 percent, respectively, while in electronics 
and clothing these numbers rise to 83 percent and 92 percent, respectively. When 
there is a price difference, the online markup tends to be small, with a magnitude 
of −4 percent in the full sample. If I include observations with identical prices, the 
online price difference is only −1 percent on average. 
I also find that price changes have similar frequencies and sizes in the online and 
offline data. However, only 19 percent of weekly price changes occur at the same 
time. While this is higher than the unconditional probability of a simultaneous price 
change, the individual price series are not well synchronized. </p>

<p>Collecting prices offline is normally an expensive and complicated process. NSOs 
rely on a large number of trained data collectors to do it correctly. Unfortunately, the 
micro data collected by NSOs for CPI purposes cannot be used for my comparisons 
because the retailer and product details are confidential information. Lacking the 
budget for a traditional data collection effort, I looked for alternatives using new 
technologies. In particular, I relied on popular crowdsourcing platforms, such as 
<rs corresp="#software-7" type="creator">Amazon</rs> <rs id="software-7" type="software">Mechanical Turk</rs>, <rs type="software">Elance</rs>, and <rs type="software">UpWork</rs>, to find people willing to do simple 
data collection tasks. To minimize the chance of data-entry errors, I developed a 
custom mobile phone app that simplified the data collection process. 
Crowdsourcing platforms have many advantages. First, they allowed me to hire 
a large number of workers and reach multiple locations and cities within each 
country. Second, there were enough workers to limit the number of individual 
prices that each had to collect. This reduced the burden on the worker and also 
minimized the " showrooming" concerns of the retailers. Showrooming is a term 
used to describe the practice of visiting a physical store to examine a product but 
later purchasing it online in another store. Many retailers worry about people who </p>

<p>Two main versions of the task were posted on the crowdsourcing websites. In the 
simplest case, the worker had to use a mobile app provided by the BPP team to scan 
10 to 50 random offline products in any physical store, with some basic instructions 
to spread out the data collection across categories of goods. This provided the bulk 
of the data that I use to compare price levels across samples. A more complex ver-
sion of the task required the worker to return to the same store every week for a full 
month and scan the same items. This gave me the panel of prices that I use to study 
price changes in Section III. 
The mobile app was custom-built to simplify and standardize the data collection 
process. It is an app for android phones called "<rs type="software">BPP @ MIT</rs>," available for down-
load at the Google Play Store. 
6 Every time a worker visits a store, she clicks on a 
button to open a new file. For the first product, she has to enter the store's name, zip 
code, and country. Then she scans the UPC barcode of the product (or the barcode

<p>Live imaging and drug perfusion 
Sand dollar or purple urchin embryos were placed on a clean glass slide in 
a 10-20 µl drop of FSW, between two ridges of high vacuum grease (Dow 
Corning) spaced 1 cm apart. A coverslip was applied, resting on the 
grease ridges, and then pressed down until eggs or embryos were trapped 
by slight-to-moderate compression. With some batches of eggs, we found it 
necessary to coat slides and coverslips by rinsing with 1% BSA in FSW to 
prevent cells from sticking too tightly to the glass and thus deforming them-
selves during cytokinesis. These chambers remained open on both ends, 
allowing perfusion of solutions by addition of large drop (40-50 µl) of FSW 
containing either nocodazole or TSA and up to 0.1% DMSO. 
Purple urchin and sand dollar embryos were imaged with a laser 
scanning confocal microscope (Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad Laboratories) 
mounted on a compound microscope (E800; Nikon) using a 40× 1.3 NA 
Plan-Fluor oil lens. Room temperature was maintained at 14-17°C, which 
is tolerated well by both species. Some experiments were conducted on a 
spinning disc confocal microscope (CARV; BD) consisting of an inverted 
microscope (TE2000; Nikon) with a 60× 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil lens 
and a 60× 1.2 NA Plan-Apochromat water lens, the CARV spinning disc 
head, and a camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu), controlled by <rs id="software-0" type="software">MetaMorph</rs>

on a laser scanning confocal microscope (1024; Bio-Rad Laboratories) 
mounted on an Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 63× 1.4 NA 
Plan-Apochromat oil objective. </p>

furrow. The latter was measured by drawing a line from the inflection 
point of the curved cell surface during midfurrow ingression to the inflec-
tion point on the opposite side, and measuring the intersection with a line 
drawn along the spindle axis. Data were plotted and tested for signifi-
cance in <rs type="software">Mathematica</rs>. </p>

<p>Image processing 
3D projection of confocal z series (brightest-point projection only; no volume 
rendering) and measurements from time-lapse confocal data were conducted 
using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. Images were adjusted for white and black point; no gamma 
adjustment or nonlinear filtering was applied except as noted in the figure 
legends. Kymographs were created from time-lapse sequences using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> 
(Fig. S1 D and Fig. 2 B) or the freeware volume rendering program <rs id="software-8" type="software">Voxx</rs>

Fig. 2 A was made using a brightest-point projection, and Fig. 2 C by using 
 blending such that only the surface is visible. Pseudocoloring and figure 
layout were performed in ImageJ or Photoshop CS3 (Adobe). </p>

<p>Analysis of Rho zone width 
As described previously (Bement et al., 2005), single frames from equivalent 
stages of furrow ingression were selected from sequences at medial planes 
within cells expressing GFP-rGBD alone or with 3C-EMTB. A freehand line 
selection was drawn along the cell edge and then straightened using 
<rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. Intensities were plotted along a 7-pixel-wide band covering the cell 
edge, yielding data points (position and intensity) spanning the Rho zone in 
the furrow. Intensity data were imported into <rs id="software-2" type="software">Mathematica</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Wolfram Re-search, Inc.</rs>.) and fit with a Gaussian curve plus a quadratic equation with 
small coefficients. The Gaussian curve fits the Rho zone, whereas the quadr-
atic fits the background cortical signal level. The width of the Rho zone was 
taken as twice the standard deviation of the fit Gaussian curve, which is 
equivalent to slightly less than the peak width at half maximum height. Total 
intensity of the Rho zone was taken as the integral under the Gaussian curve 
from the center plus or minus two standard deviations, minus the integral in 
the baseline fit over the same region. Zone widths plotted in Fig. 6 B were 
normalized by the pole-to-pole distance in each measured cell. Significance 
was judged using the mean difference test in <rs type="software">Mathematica</rs>. </p>

<p>Creation and analysis of anucleate cytoplasts 
Sand dollar zygotes were bisected either freehand using a fine glass 
needle or using a needle mounted on a hanging-joystick oil hydraulic 
micromanipulator (Narishige Group). Bisection was conducted after pro-
nuclear fusion for uninjected eggs, or 45 min after fertilization (and after 
injection) for injected eggs. Bisection yields half zygotes, which by ran-
dom chance include some pairs in which one half contains the nucleus 
and a single centrosome and the other half contains only a centrosome. 
Such pairs were recognized by differential interference contrast micros-
copy or by staining live cells with Hoechst 33342. Anucleate, centrosome-
containing cytoplasts conduct orderly centrosome duplication and separa-
tion on a normal schedule; the nucleated half skips first cleavage, then 
develops normally as a tetraploid (Fig. 8 D). Among EMTB-3G-expressing 
anucleate cytoplasts, we scored all cases in which either no furrows or dis-
crete furrows formed (omitting cases in which the cytoplast strangled itself 
into the shape of a balloon animal, which we took to be a sign of poor 
health) as follows: for each centrosome pair in focus, we measured, at the 
time corresponding to anaphase, the distance between centrosomes and 
divided by the distance from the midpoint between them to the cell surface. 
We then scored cortical behavior into three categories: (1) no furrow or 
incoherent ruffling, (2) shallow furrow, or (3) deep or complete furrow. 
Significance was judged using the mean difference test in <rs type="software">Mathematica</rs>. </p>

<p>Four shoulder patterns of NJF were used. The pat-
terns were shoulder extension-adduction-internal rotation, 
shoulder flexion-abduction-external rotation, shoulder ex-
tension-abduction-internal rotation, and shoulder flexion-
adduction-external rotation pattern. Each pattern was per-
formed three times at random as a passive exercise and as 
a resistance exercise, respectively. The subjects in the NJF 
group received the intervention three times a week for 8 
weeks. The intervention was performed by the same physi-
cal therapist to avoid individual variations in therapy. For 
the control group, the intervention was not performed. 
To determine whether there were differences between 
the NJF group and the control group, the independent t-
test was performed on subject characteristics. Two-way 
ANOVA and multiple comparisons (Bonferroni test) were 
used to test for statistically significant differences, and the 
factors were intervention and group. If a significant interac-
tion was found, the paired t-test was performed to compare 
before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 17.0</rs> for Windows. The level of statistical signifi-
cance was chosen as 0.05. </p>

<p>The between-groups difference in the proportion of partici-
pants making a change in behavior related to their osteo-
porosis risk was analyzed using the odds ratio and 95% 
confidence interval (CI). The between-group difference in 
knowledge change score was analyzed using an independent 
group t-test and 95% CI of the difference score. McNemar's 
chi-square was used to analyze the change from baseline 
to follow-up in the proportion of the treatment group with 
adequate vitamin D intake. Study outcomes were analyzed 
on a per protocol basis. All analyses were conducted using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">OpenEpi</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.03a</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">www.openepi.com</rs>). </p>

<p>or cytokine levels and age were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis. 
Age correction and ANOVA were applied when a significant association was 
observed. For statistical differences in serum cytokine levels between sero-
positive and seronegative subjects and to correct for the effect of age, cyto-
kine concentrations were log-transformed to obtain approximately normally 
distributed measures and then analyzed using ANOVA. Values of P , 0.05 
were considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were performed in

<p>In this study, 14 subjects each for the pronated, supinated, and normal foot groups were selected from among 162 healthy 
university students by using the ND test proposed by Brody 9) . The mean age, weight, and height of the subjects were 
20.9 years, 61.2 kg, and 165.5 cm, respectively. No significant differences in these characteristics were found among the 
groups. This study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Catholic University of Pusan (CUPIRB-2015-026). 
In order to classify foot type, the ND test 9) was used, in which the subjects were seated comfortably in a chair, with their 
feet on the ground, to mark the furthest protruding part of the medial navicular tubercle. Then, the distance from the ground to 
the marked navicular tubercle was measured with a plastic ruler. This distance was also measured while the subjects were in 
the standing position, under weight-bearing conditions. By comparing the measured values between the sitting and standing 
positions, the subjects were classified into normal, pronated, and supinated foot groups if the difference was within a range 
of 5 to 9 mm, more than 10 mm, or less than 4 mm, respectively 9) . Each of the measurements was conducted three times, and 
the mean value was calculated. The dominant foot was the foot used for the measurements. 
To measure dynamic balance ability, a star excursion balance test (SEBT) was conducted for each group, because of its 
high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.88-0.96) 10) . For the SEBT, a cross-shaped line was drawn on the floor, 
with additional lines drawn 45° in eight directions. In this study, only three directions were used (anterior, posterolateral, and 
posteromedial), according to the study by Hyong 11) . The measurements were conducted while the subjects set the heels of 
their dominant feet at the center point and stretched the feet in the anterior direction as much as possible while maintaining 
balance. The point where the big toe ended was marked. The posterolateral and posteromedial directions were measured in 
the same way. Each subject's measurements were taken three times, and the mean value was calculated for each group. In or-
der to minimize errors due to differences in leg length between the subjects, the values were standardized using the formula: 
measured value/leg length × 100. For the leg length measurements, the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine 
of the medial malleolus and the tubercle of the shin was measured while the subject was in the supine position. Statistical 
analysis was conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 12.0</rs>, while one-way analysis of variance was used to compare dynamic balance 
ability among the three groups. The significance level was set to 0.05. </p>

<p>Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of sleep deprivation on 
flow experience. 
Methods: Sixteen healthy male volunteers of mean age 21.4±1.59 (21-24) years participated 
in two experimental conditions, ie, sleep-deprivation and normal sleep. In the sleep-deprived 
condition, participants stayed awake at home for 36 hours (from 8 am until 10 pm the next day) 
beginning on the day prior to an experimental day. In both conditions, participants carried out a 
simple reaction time (psychomotor vigilance) task and responded to a questionnaire measuring 
flow experience and mood status. 
Results: Flow experience was reduced after one night of total sleep deprivation. Sleep 
loss also decreased positive mood, increased negative mood, and decreased psychomotor 
performance. 
Conclusion: Sleep deprivation has a strong impact on mental and behavioral states associated 
with the maintenance of flow, namely subjective well-being.

<p>Paired t-tests were used to compare the sleep-deprived and 
normal sleep conditions. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
(nonparametric test, n=16) was also applied. Significance 
levels were set at P,0.05. All statistical analyses were 
conducted using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</rs>

<p>government size has a more positive impact on subjective well-being for people 
with left-wing political preferences. 
Secondly, the coefficient for the interaction between government expenditures 
and expenditure decentralization is significant at the 1% level. Hence, govern-
ment size has a more positive effect on well-being in countries that allow for a 
higher degree of local autonomy. Finally, the interaction term with regard to 
corruption has the expected negative sign and is significant at the 10% or 1% 
level, respectively. Model 7a additionally reveals a highly significant negative 
quadratic term for government expenditures. This suggests an inversely U-shaped 
relationship and diminishing returns to government size in terms of well-being. 
The statements made so far only refer to statistical significance, while we 
have not been able to say anything about the coefficients' economic signifi-
cance. This has to do with the fact that the magnitudes of the coefficients have 
no meaningful interpretation in microeconometric estimations. The usual 
procedure is to calculate marginal effects which for instance summarize how 
an increase in government expenditures affects a person's probability to be 
'very satisfied' with his or her life. However, for several reasons we abstain from 
making these calculations and resort to the coefficients of the OLS estimations 
in section IV.2. The first justification for this approach is that Ferrer-i-
Carbonell and Frijters (2004) provide overwhelming evidence that results 
barely differ between OLS and ordered probit estimations in the context of 
happiness research. After all, the main difference between these two estimators 
is that the former assumes a cardinal interpretation of life satisfaction data, 
while the latter is more conservative and only presumes an ordinal ranking. 
Secondly, the marginal effects that we are interested in refer to the interaction 
terms at the top of table 1. However, the calculation of marginal effects in the 
context of nonlinear estimations with interaction terms is much more difficult 
than assumed by many researchers. In this context, Ai and Norton (2003) have 
identified 72 articles published between 1980 and 1999 in the economics 
journals listed on JSTOR that use interaction terms in nonlinear models. 
However, none of them provides a correct interpretation of the interaction 
term's marginal effect. In fact, the reported results often diverge strongly from 
the true results. As Ai and Norton (2003) point out, these marginal effects are 
not calculated by standard statistical software packages such as <rs type="software">Stata</rs>. </p>

<p>oculogram), and chin and tibialis anterior electromyogram 
sensors to assess muscle activity. Physiological signals were 
recorded using Nihon Kohden equipment (Foothill Ranch, 
CA, USA). Other instruments included a nasal airflow sensor, 
comfortable belts around the thorax and abdomen to monitor 
respiratory effort, a finger probe to assess pulse oximetry, 
and a microphone to monitor snoring. Each study session 
was digitally video recorded. The sleep records were scored 
according to standardized scoring criteria. 
36 The outcome 
measures of interest are as follows: TST, SE, time spent in 
stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R, and percent sleep 
period time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage 
R. For data analysis, <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 20.0</rs> was used to perform 
all statistical analysis, and alpha was set at 0.05. Descriptive 
statistics were calculated. The data were analyzed for normal-
ity using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Skewness and Kurtosis 
test, as well as Box plots and normal Q-Q plots. Independent 
t-tests were used to compare the sleep parameters of the 
individuals with stroke with the control participants when 
the assumption of normality was satisfied. Effect sizes were 
calculated as Cohen's d values. Because this is a pilot study, 
data are presented without correction for multiplicity. Due to 
the sex difference in the stroke sample, linear regression was 
used to study if sex predicts the outcome measure of interest 
after controlling for age which can be a confounding factor 
for change in sleep parameters. An exploratory analysis was 
performed using independent t-tests to compare the sleep 
characteristics and descriptive characteristics of individuals 
with left-sided MCA lesions (n=7) to those with right-sided 
MCA lesions (n=9). Alpha was set at 0.05. </p>

tinuous variables with normal distribution were expressed 
as mean ± standard deviation and were compared by 
using Student's t-tests. Variables with non-normal distri-
bution were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test, and 
categorical variables were expressed as percentage and 
compared by the χ 
2 test. The mean renal survival time 
until the selected end points was calculated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between the calcu-
lated mean renal survival times were compared using the 
log-rank test. The effect of confounders was assessed by 
Cox regression analysis. 
Confounders were determined a priori based on theor-
etical considerations and by examining baseline covariate 
associations with metabolic syndrome and with the renal 
end points [14]. Multivariate models were constructed 
with sequential adjustments for age and gender as well 
as for age, gender, uric acid, eGFR, smoking and angioten-
sin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor 
blocker (ACEis/ARB). A value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. </p>

<p>Statistics and analyses 
Patient characteristics are reported as frequencies and percent-
ages. 
Bivariate analyses: Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations 
rank test was used to test for differences in overall satisfaction 
between surgeons and satisfaction with LOS. Non-parametric 
tests for trend, as described by Cuzick (1985), were used to 
explore the trend of overall satisfaction measured on the NRS 
for age group, LOS, and satisfaction with: information given, 
pain treatment, rehabilitation during hospitalization, discharge 
procedure, and the first weeks at home. 2-sample Wilcoxon 
rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) tests were used to explore dif-
ferences between genders and types of operation (THR and 
TKR). 
Multiple regression: Due to the possible clustering on 
operating surgeon, we used mixed linear regression models 
to estimate the intraclass correlation of the clustering on oper-
ating surgeon. We found that there was no statistically sig-
nificant intraclass correlation. Thus, linear regression with 
robust standard errors using the <rs type="software">STATA</rs> command "cluster 
(cluster variable)"was used-which relaxes the independence 
assumption and requires only that the observations should be 
independent across the clusters (STATA 2013). Overall sat-
isfaction was treated as the outcome and comorbidities were 
treated as the independent variables. LOS, age group, and 
gender were coded as dummy variables (Table 2), and were 
tested for interactions between LOS and comorbidities. Statis-
tically significant interactions were included in the final analy-
sis. Of the 9 surgeons who performed the operations, each per-</p>

<p>formed a mean of 48 (8-79) operations. It has been shown that 
a random variation exists between surgeons (Randsborg et al. 
2010). We therefore checked to determine whether the operat-
ing surgeon should be included as a random variable, taking 
into account the random variation across surgeons using linear 
mixed-effect model analysis. 
The statistical assumptions for a linear mixed-effect model 
analysis apply to both the between-subjects and within-sub-
jects effects. The between-subjects assumptions are the same 
as those in a standard regression analysis: the independence 
of scores, normality of the residuals, and equal variances 
(known as homogeneity of variance). As this was not the case, 
we applied cluster robust standard errors using the Hubert-
White sandwich estimator. This relaxes the assumption of 
independence, thus producing "correct" standard errors (in 
the measurement sense) even if the observations are corre-
lated. Even so, caution is needed in interpreting the results. In 
addition, the mixed model also assumes a linear relationship 
between the dependent and independent variables, equality 
of variances of the difference scores for all pairs of scores at 
all levels of the within-subjects factor, and equal covariances 
for the between-subjects factor. This assumption is known as 
the sphericity assumption. Sphericity is especially important 
for mixed model analysis. Bartlett's test for sphericity was 
performed to test for this, and it showed no statistically sig-
nificant departure from the sphericity assumption. Thus, we 
decided to assess the intraclass correlation of the model using 
a linear mixed model with robust standard errors-as the 
assumptions for this model appeared to be fulfilled. If a statis-
tically significant intraclass correlation was evident, a mixed 
linear regression model was used; if not, then "normal" OLS 
linear regression with robust standard errors was used. As no 
significant intraclass correlation was found, a "normal" OLS 
linear regression with robust standard errors was performed 
and q-q normal plots were used to check for normality of the 
residuals of the model. <rs id="software-2" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">13</rs> and <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">17.1</rs> were used

<p>Some of the models recorded in Figure 1 are well known and frequently used 
in applied research, while other models are not. LeSage &amp; Pace (p. 32) denote the 
model with a spatially lagged dependent variable (WY) and a spatially 
autocorrelated error term (Wo) by the term SAC, though without pointing out 
what this acronym is standing for. Since Kelejian &amp; Prucha (1998) have been the 
main advocates of this model, it is therefore renamed the KelejianÁPrucha model 
in this paper. The model with a spatially lagged dependent variable (WY) and 
spatially lagged independent variables (WX) has been introduced by Anselin 
(1988) and is labelled the spatial Durbin model. A model with spatially lagged 
independent variables (WX) and a spatially autocorrelated error term has hardly 
been used in the literature. LeSage &amp; Pace (pp. 41Á42) label it the spatial Durbin 
error model. 
Figure 1 seems to indicate that the best strategy to test for spatial interaction 
effects is to start with the most general model, i.e. the model that includes a spatially 
lagged dependent variable, spatially lagged independent variables, and a spatially 
autocorrelated error term simultaneously. However, as Manski (1993) notes, at least 
one of the K'2 interaction effects must be excluded, because otherwise the 
parameters are unidentified. To verify this, I carried out a simple Monte Carlo 
experiment generating Y by (2a) and (2b), one X variable drawn from a uniform 
distribution on the interval [Á1,1], r 0 a 0 b 0 u 0 l 0 0:25; s 
2 00.01, N060, 
and a spatial weights matrix W corresponding to the corners of the seams in a soccer 
ball (in <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> known as the Bucky Ball). Based on 1,000 repetitions, I found biases 
in the parameter estimates of the endogenous and exogenous interaction effects 
(r and u, respectively) that may be as great as 0.0423 and, related to that, standard 
deviations that may be as great as 0.2677. These results corroborate Manski's (1993, 
p. 534) finding that there are no technical obstacles to estimating a model with 
interaction effects among the dependent variable, the independent variables and the 
disturbance terms, but that the parameter estimates cannot be interpreted in a 
meaningful way since the endogenous and exogenous effects cannot be 
distinguished from each other. 
Following LeSage &amp; Pace (pp. 155Á158), the best option in such circumstances 
is to exclude the spatially autocorrelated error term. 
2 The cost of ignoring spatial 
dependence in the dependent variable and/or in the independent variables is 
relatively high since the econometrics literature has pointed out that if one or more 
relevant explanatory variable are omitted from a regression equation, the estimator 
of the coefficients for the remaining variables is biased and inconsistent (Greene, 
2005, pp. 133Á134). In contrast, ignoring spatial dependence in the disturbances, if 
present, will only cause a loss of efficiency. Furthermore, the spatial Durbin model 
produces unbiased coefficient estimates also if the true data-generation process is 
any of the other spatial regression specifications recorded in Figure 1, except for the 
Manski model. By contrast, if the KelejianÁPrucha model is taken as the point of 
departure, it will suffer from omitted variables bias if the true data-generation 
process is a spatial Durbin or a spatial Durbin error model. Similarly, if the spatial 
Durbin error model is taken as the point of departure, it will suffer from omitted 
variables bias if the true data-generation process is a spatial lag, KelejianÁPrucha or 
spatial Durbin model. 
A concomitant advantage of the spatial Durbin model is that it produces correct 
standard errors or t-values of the coefficient estimates also if the true data-
generating process is a spatial error model. This is because the spatial error model is 
a special case of the spatial Durbin model (see Figure 1), as a result of which error </p>

<p>nested models to carry out these comparisons (p. 162). The basic idea is to set prior 
probabilities equal to 1/S, making each model equally likely a priori, to estimate 
each model by Bayesian methods, and then to compute posterior probabilities 
based on the data and the estimation results of this set of S models. Although the 
mathematics of this approach might deter potential users (Chs 5 and 6), my 
experience with this approach is positive. First, posterior model probabilities may 
differ widely even if the estimation results appear to be quite robust to different 
specifications of the spatial weights matrix. In a study I did on cross-country 
differences in governance (Seldadyo et al., 2010), the posterior model probability of 
a 10 nearest-neighbour matrix appeared to be more than six times as large as that of 
an inverse distance matrix, more than three times as large as that of a five nearest-
neighbour matrix, and more than twice as large as an inverse distance matrix with a 
cut-off point. Second, since Matlab routines applying Bayesian methods to the 
spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models are made downloadable for free 
on LeSage's website (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">www.spatial-econometrics.com</rs>), these kinds of comparisons 
can be carried out relatively easily. Furthermore, since <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">LeSage</rs> also provides <rs id="software-1" type="software">Matlab</rs> 
routines applying the Bayesian method to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial 
Durbin models of limited dependent variables, similar types of selection procedures 
as discussed in this and the previous sections can be used for empirical problems 
requiring a probit or tobit approach (Ch. 10). 
Another approach to capture spatial interaction effects is to extend the linear 
regression model by a finite number of unobserved factors that affect all units 
(Pesaran, 2006). Factor models are potentially powerful in that they do not require 
strong and unverifiable assumptions on the nature of spatial dependence. On the 
other hand, common factors only model interaction effects among the error terms 
and, often, these factors are difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, a careful elaboration 
of the relative merits of the multifactor approach, for example, in combination with 
the spatial Durbin model is an interesting topic for further research. </p>

<p>Development of the palate comprises sequential stages of growth, elevation, and fusion 
of the palatal shelves. The mesenchymal component of palates plays a major role in 
early phases of palatogenesis, such as growth and elevation. Failure in these steps may 
result in cleft palate, the second most common birth defect in the world. These early 
stages of palatogenesis require precise and chronological orchestration of key physiologi-
cal processes, such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis.There 
is compelling evidence for the vital role ofTGFβ-mediated regulation of palate development. 
We hypothesized that the isoforms of TGFβ regulate different cellular biofunctions of the 
palatal mesenchyme to various extents. Human embryonic palatal mesenchyme (HEPM) 
cells were treated with TGFβ1, β2, and β3 for microarray-based gene expression studies in 
order to identify the roles of TGFβ in the transcriptome of the palatal mesenchyme. Follow-
ing normalization and modeling of 28,869 human genes, 566 transcripts were detected as 
differentially expressed in TGFβ-treated HEPM cells. Out of these altered transcripts, 234 
of them were clustered in cellular biofunctions, including growth and proliferation, devel-
opment, morphology, movement, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Biological interpretation and 
network analysis of the genes active in cellular biofunctions were performed using <rs type="software">IPA</rs>. 
Among the differentially expressed genes, 11 of them are known to be crucial for palatoge-
nesis (EDN1, INHBA, LHX8, PDGFC, PIGA, RUNX1, SNAI1, SMAD3, TGF β1, TGF β2, and 
TGF βR1).These genes were used for a merged interaction network with cellular behaviors. 
Overall, we have determined that more than 2% of human transcripts were differentially 
expressed in response to TGFβ treatment in HEPM cells. Our results suggest that both 
TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 orchestrate major cellular biofunctions within the palatal mesenchyme 
in vitro by regulating expression of 234 genes. </p>

<p>Data analysis 
1. Comparative analysis of the strains´growth 
The O.D. values from Bioscreen C were analyzed using 
spreadsheet software (<rs id="software-1" type="software">Microsoft Excel</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">97</rs>) and the averages 
calculated of the quadruplicates for each type of culture medium. 
These averages were used to generate growth curves for each 
type of culture (O.D. 540 nm of the cultures versus incubation 
time). Figures present the data from the average of readings 
(from quadruplicates) taken from every fourth hour of cultivation. 
Because the spore solution of each strain presented different 
colors, at time zero, the initial O.D. values were distinctive to 
each culture in relation to the control culture. This coloration 
difference (defined here as "specific color influence factor" for 
each strain) was calculated as follows: </p>

<p>Color influence = O.D. of each culture (t 0 ) -O.D. of the control 
(t 0 ) 
Next, the influence factor specific to each strain was 
subtracted from all O.D values from 0 to 72 h of each culture, in 
order to express the real growth of the strains. The analysis of 
variance (Kruskal-Wallis test, <rs id="software-2" type="software">BioEstat</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">4.0</rs> software) was applied 
using the data obtained, and confirmed by Dunn post hoc test, 
which was used to verify the significance of the strain's growth 
compared to the control and among the strains (5). The 
experimental results were separated into four classes based on 
the time taken for growth: I) 0 to 18 h, II) 18 to 36 h, III) 36 to 54 
h, and IV) 54 to 72 h. The results were analyzed by triangulation 
of the statistical data with the differences of O.D. per period. </p>

<p>prediction of vertebral fracture and hip fracture using 
femoral neck BMD in the Korean, Japanese, USA and UK 
models were assessed using the ANOVA methods. FRAX 
prediction of vertebral fracture using lumbar spine BMD in 
the Korean, Japanese, USA and UK models were assessed 
using the ANOVA methods. Each result was analyzed using 
the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 12.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA) and a p &lt; 
0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>In time series models, error terms are often serially correlated, and this 
requires bootstrap approaches that differ from the cross-section case. The simplest 
approach, called model-based bootstrapping, is to assume that the time series can 
be fit by an appropriate autoregressive moving average model with serially uncor-
related residuals. Then the bootstrap can be implemented using bootstrap ap-
proaches that take samples from the residuals of a regression (as discussed in more 
detail in footnote 1), although the method of generating the bootstrap samples 
from these bootstrapped residuals needs to be modified to account for the dynamic 
nature of the time series model. 
6 Similarly, in panel data settings, the bootstrap 
must be modified to account for time dependence for observations within cross-
section units-for example, through bootstrap sampling of the complete set of 
observations for cross-section units (Ziliak, 1997). 
Although it is mechanically possible to apply the bootstrap to any model, there 
are circumstances where the bootstrap will fail to estimate the sampling distribution 
consistently (for details, see Horowitz, 2001, section 2.1). For example, Andrews 
(2000) shows that the bootstrap does not accurately estimate the sampling distri-
bution of a coefficient whose true value is zero and whose estimate is constrained 
to be greater than or equal to zero. 
Despite these caveats and inherent uncertainty about the superiority of the 
bootstrap in specific settings, the availability of powerful desktop computers makes 
widespread use of the bootstrap very tempting. Bootstrap estimates-especially 
based on the paired approach-are trivial to obtain once the estimation model is 
specified. The statistical package <rs type="software">Stata</rs> has several bootstrap procedures and sub-
routines available in its core program, and a researcher who has never read a single </p>

13 (2004).In this method, a 2-trial forced-
choice procedure was employed. The subjects 
were presented with 2 simultaneous tones of 
different frequencies (i.e., 500 Hz and 800 Hz) 
and were asked to judge the relative location of 
the pair by indicating whether the higher tone was 
to the left or right of the lower tone, on the right 
hand side of the subjects (Figure 1). The subjects' 
head was positioned in the center. The subjects 
were instructed to keep their heads in this position 
for the duration of the recording process (about 
15 min). Testing took place using 3 reference 
locations on a horizontal plane: 0°, 30°, and 60°. 
For each reference location, 10 test locations were 
chosen on the basis of preliminary testing. In each 
trial, a pair of concurrent stimuli was presented. 
One stimulus corresponded to 1 of the reference 
locations, and the second stimulus was presented 
from 1 of the 10 test locations displaced in either 
azimuth. Prior to data acquisition, the subjects 
completed training blocks to ensure that they 
were able to detect the targets. Using a criterion 
of 75% correct in each test location, we measured 
the concurrent minimum audible angle. Stimuli 
were generated using <rs id="software-0" type="software">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">The MathWorks</rs>,

All the analyses were conducted using 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(<rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs>), <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 16</rs>. Due to the relatively 
small group numbers in the study, the data did 
not meet normality assumptions in general. 
Therefore, nonparametric statistics (Mann-
Whitney U) were used to compare the between-
group differences. The Pearson correlation was 
employed to measure the degree of association 
between working memory capacity and the 
localization tests. The significance level adopted 
was 0.05 (5%), with confidence intervals of 95%. </p>

<p>The samples were mixed with loading buffer (95% 
formamide, 25 mM EDTA and 5 mg/ml blue dextran) 
and denatured for 2 min at 90

[20 ml 12% polyacrylamide/7 M urea with 100 ml 10% 
ammonium persulphate (Sigma Aldrich) and 10 ml 100%

NY, USA). To compare the effects of the three 
supplements (on each outcome measure, over time), 
we used repeated-measures analysis of variance, and 
contingency table analysis, as appropriate. Cognisant that 
this exploratory study would likely have insufficient 
power for such analyses, however, we did some 
additional analyses. In fact, and beyond the previously 
reported 12-month data, 8 we decided upon two strands of 
analysis: (a) between supplement group analysis over 
time: despite the small sample sizes, supplement groups 
were compared with each other, for changes in each 
outcome variable over the 3 years of the study. For 
interval outcome variables (MP, serum carotenoids, 
BCVA, CS), the method of analysis was repeated-
measures analysis of variance, with time as a within-
subjects factor and supplement as a between-subjects 
factor; we used the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for 
lack of sphericity. Post hoc analysis, with Bonferroni 
adjustment for multiple testing, was used where 
appropriate. For categorical outcome variables (AMD 
grade), we used contingency table analysis to compare 
supplements; (b) within-supplement group changes in 
each outcome variable, over the 3 years of the study. 
We used paired t-tests analysis here. 
Tests of significance, for all t-test analyses, were two-
tailed, and the 5% level of significance was used 
throughout. With the exception of post hoc analyses for the 
repeated-measures analysis of variance, we did not 
correct for multiple tests. </p>

<p>The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) captures the antidisciplinary ethos 
of the MIT Media Lab. Like the Lab, it opens new connections between 
science and design, encouraging discourse that breaks down the barriers 
between traditional academic disciplines. It explores not only the design 
of science, but also the science of design. 
With this innovative approach, JoDS intends to incite much-needed 
change in academic publishing by challenging traditional academic silos 
as well as the established publishing practices associated with them. 
The journal is hosted on an open-access, open-review, rapid 
publication platform called <rs id="software-1" type="software">PubPub</rs>, created by <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">students at the Media Lab</rs>. <rs type="software">PubPub</rs> is a collaborative publication environment with rich 
commenting features, and powerful, intuitive authoring tools. JoDS 
articles are authored directly within the <rs type="software">PubPub</rs> environment, which 
provides support for multimedia, image integration, and large data sets. 
Unlike journals that operate within a formal peer review system and 
rigid disciplinary framework, JoDS invites jargon-free communication 
across all fields of design and science, unconventional formats, and 
widespread community participation. JoDS empowers authors to engage 
in fruitful, ongoing discussion about their work with members of many 
different communities, both within and outside of their home disciplines. 
This rich, peer-to-peer approach to review provides for a much broader 
array of perspectives, new pathways forward, and emergent topics for 
further research. 
JoDS is shepherded by a team led by MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito, 
and published in partnership with the MIT Press. All JoDS articles are

<p>Integrating out the unobservable component introduces an integral of the above 
probabilities in each individual contribution to the sample likelihood function. 
Estimation by maximum likelihood of both models can be automatically 
implemented in <rs type="software">STATA</rs>, although the maximization of the likelihood function of 
the second model requires the evaluation of an integral by Gaussian Quadrature 
(Butler and Moffitt, 1982). The first model ignores individual heterogeneity and 
does not exploit the repeated observation available on the same woman. The infer-
ence requires the use of a robust covariance matrix to take into account the error 
serial correlation induced by the unobserved individual component not varying 
with time. 
The second model allows us to incorporate the individual unobserved effects, 
which is generally found to represent a very substantial component in estimated 
female labour participation equations (Hyslop, 1999, finds that the individual-
specific RE accounts for 78 percent of the latent error variance) but relies on two 
main assumptions: (i) absence of correlation between the individual heterogeneity 
and the regressors, (ii) strict exogeneity of the explanatory variables conditionally 
on the individual heterogeneity component. Whenever either of these hypotheses 
fails, the estimates we obtain for the effects of the children on labour supply are 
not consistent (notice that in this instance the pooled probit would suffer from the 
same problem). We addressed the first limitation by adopting as a final specifica-
tion a correlated random effect (CRE) probit model, which allows the unobserved 
preferences for working to be correlated with observed fertility. We followed 
Chamberlain's suggestion (1984) and postulated: </p>

<p>To adjust for unequal probabilities of selection and to 
account for nonparticipation, all estimates were calcu-
lated on the basis of the sampling weight. Comparisons 
between groups were performed using the chi-square 
test or linear regression analysis. Multivariate regres-
sion was performed for the analysis of the association 
of secondhand smoke exposure and COPD prevalence 
after adjustment for age, gender, previous diagnosis of 
asthma or tuberculosis, family income, and education

<p>The disk-scanning unit has a spinning disk and a filter-set wheel 
changer. The spinning disk is put on the primary image plane for 
confocal imaging. The disk was made by using electron lithography 
on a low-reflection chrome coat that covered a fused silica substrate 
(DU-DSR1-SP; Olympus). The width and the pitch of the confocal slit 
apertures were 80 and 270 nm, respectively, as discussed in the 
main text. 
For comparisons with WF, the disk was removed and a neutral 
density filter with a transmission factor of 6% (ND6) was put into the 
illumination path to adjust the image brightness. The image was 
projected onto the camera via a 5× magnifier and taken by 2 × 2 
binning mode. Thus the pixel size of the specimen is 43 nm with a 
60× objective lens, satisfying the Nyquist condition for up to 100-nm 
resolution. The software package <rs id="software-0" type="software">MetaMorph</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>, 
Sunnyvale, CA) was used to control the system and for acquisition of 
the image. </p>

<p>A cross-sectional study was conducted with foundry workers within the metallurgical industry (Metal Casting Process, 
Shell Molding Line; with shape-out tasks) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. All participants signed informed consent. The study protocol 
was approved by the local Ethics Committee (protocol 0048.1.1186.000-10). All workers who performed their duties while 
exposed to high temperatures from ovens were selected to this study. Workers were excluded due to various reasons such 
as dismissal, sick leave, or refusal to participate. All participants performed spirometry (EasyOne TM, model 2001) ac-
cording to the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society protocol (2005) at their workplace. The values 
are expressed as a percentage of the predicted values obtained in Brazilian subjects 15) . The measurement of peak expiratory 
flow was performed following three rapid exhalations by the patient (Mini Wright Standard with a flow between 60 and 
800 l/min). The best result among them was used. Anthropometrics measure (height and weight) of the participants were 
performed using the Microlife brand, previously calibrated stadiometer (Sany). To evaluate the activity level of the workers, 
the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form was used. The questions are related to the time spent 
engaging in physical activity in a typical week/habitual. People were considered active if they had accumulated more than 
150 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week 16) . Then, a routine physical examination and evaluation 
of previous medical history; respiratory signs and symptoms, according to a respiratory disease's questionnaire; smoking 
history; and checklist were implemented. The dyspnea was assessed by Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea scale 17) . 
The foundry workers were classified according to exposure time in High (&gt;5 years) and Low exposure groups (≤ 5 years). A 
control group consisted of administrative area workers from the same industry. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was 
used to analyze the data distribution. The data were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis, mean, standard deviation, 
and 95% confidence interval. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni adjusted was used to determine 
whether there are significant differences between groups (α&lt;5%). The statistical analysis was performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Sigma Stat</rs> 
software package, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 3.2</rs> (San Jose, EUA). </p>

<p>Methods 
Mosquito surveillance data provided by DPH was analyzed 
for years 2015 and 2016 to date. The geographical distribution of 
counties conducting surveillance, total number and percentage by 
mosquito species collected in 2015 were compared to 2016 data. 
The distribution of counties conducting surveillance was mapped 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">ArcMap</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">10.4.1</rs> for pre and post Zika response. Autochthonous 
vector transmission risk was evaluated based on the overall numbers 
and percentages of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes 
collected for 2016. </p>

<p>Continuous variables were compared using Student t 
test and dichotomous variables using the chi-square 
test. Survival time was measured from the date of sur-
gical resection to the date of death or last contact. Con-
ventional clinical variables at the time of entry into the 
study and immunopositivity for PDI were analyzed to 
identify factors that influenced survival, as determined 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using 
the log-rank test. Stepwise, univariate, and multivariate 
analyses were performed using the Cox proportional 
hazards model to identify factors that influenced sur-
vival. Variables found to be significantly associated with 
the outcome in the univariate analyses were included 
in the multivariate analysis. All statistical analyses were 
performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 19.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM Co.</rs>., Armonk, </p>

<p>Crystallization-Segment peptides were purchased from CS 
BIO Inc. (Menlo Park, CA) in 35-50-mg batches with 99% 
purity as lyophilized powders. Both were dissolved in 20 mM 
Bis-Tris to buffer the effect of residual trifluoroacetic acid. 
Crystals GYMLGS (Met 
129 ) were grown within hours at pep-
tide concentrations of 25 mg/ml by exposing the protein to 200 
mM buffers with higher pH (Ͼ5) using the hanging drop 
method. Best diffraction quality crystals were obtained from 
200 mM Tris, pH 7.0. Although GYVLGS (Val 
129 ) also readily 
formed crystals when exposed to higher pH buffers, they were 
thin and diffracted poorly. Screening using kits from Hampton 
Research (Aliso Viejo, CA) were used to search for better qual-
ity crystals. After optimization, diffraction quality crystals came 
from a 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 
17% PEG 10,000 with the Val 
129 segment at a concentration of 
32 mg/ml. 
Data Collection-Crystals of the segments grew as thin nee-
dles and required the use of microdiffraction beamlines at the 
Advanced Photon Source (APS) in Chicago, IL and the Swiss 
Light Source (SLS) in Villigen, Switzerland. Crystals were 
cooled to Ϫ180°C during data collection. Data were collected 
using 5°wedges. 
Data Processing-Indexing of diffraction images was per-
formed using the programs DENZO (15) or XDS (16). Scaling of 
data was performed using the program <rs type="software">SCALEPACK</rs> (15). The 
merged scaled data were imported into the CCP4 format with 
programs from the CCP4 program suite organized under the 
CCP4i interface (17). 
Structure Determination and Refinement-Phases were 
determined using the molecular replacement method with ide-
alized polyalanine ␤-strands using the program <rs type="software">PHASER</rs> (18). 
The program COOT (19) was used for model building along 
with rounds of refinement with the program REFMAC (20). 
Statistics for structure determination and atomic refinement 
are given in Table 1. 
Creating Models of Mixed Interfaces-The program pdbset 
from the CCP4 program suite (17) was used to create a pair of </p>

<p>stacked ␤-sheets using crystallographic symmetry operations 
outlined in the REMARK 350 fields found in the Protein Data 
Bank (PDB) files defining the biological assembly for each 
respective structure. The program COOT (19) was used to 
superimpose strands of the GYVLGS onto the biological assem-
bly of GYMLGS and vice versa. 
Features of Peptide Structures and Models-Programs from 
the CCP4 program suite were used to calculate structural align-
ments and statistics for interpreting differences and similarities 
between segment interfaces (17). The programs pdbset and 
areaimol were used to calculate the area buried in between the 
sheet-to-sheet interface. Similarly, the programs pdbset and sc 
were used to calculate the surface complementarity of the inter-
faces. The program lsqkab was used for structural alignments 
and to calculate r.m.s.d values between segments. The program 
hollow was used to model voids in the Met 
129 and Val 
129 mixed 
models (21). 
Illustration of Structures-Protein structures and models 
were illustrated using the program <rs type="software">PyMOL</rs> (22). 
Accession Codes-The structures have been deposited in the 
protein data bank as 3NHC for the GYMLGS (Met 
129 ) segment 
and 3NHD for the GYVLGS (Val 
129 ) segment. </p>

<p>Data were presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean 
(SEM) of three independent in vitro experiments. Statistical 
analysis and graphical representations were performed with

USA). The relations between clinical features and the PLCB1 
expression were analyzed using chi-squared test and in vitro 
studies were evaluated with the Student's t-test. The Kaplan-
Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and 
Cox regression model was applied to calculate univariate and 
multivariate hazard ratios for the study variables. A P-value 
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>All neonates with heart murmur underwent 
echocardiography by cardiologist to explain the 
nature of the abnormality. The results of 
echocardiography were categorized as a) 
structural heart malformation, b) physical 
variance and c) completely normal. 
Birth weight, gestational age and gender in all 
infants were noted. Maternal age at delivery and 
folic acid use were recorded in the questionnaire. 
The Spearman's Rho and Chi 2 tests were used to 
define correlation and association between 
variables. Significance level of P&gt;0.05 was used in 
the analysis. All statistical analyses were 
performed using <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> software. </p>

<p>Paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with anti-MLKL 
antibody (1:60 dilution, ab118348; Abcam, Cambridge, 
MA, USA) at 4°C overnight. Rabbit immunoglobulin G 
was used as a negative control. After washing three times 
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the slides were incu-
bated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution; 
Vector Laboratories Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) at room 
temperature for 30 minutes. After washing three times with 
PBS, the slides were stained with the ABC Elite kit (Vector 
Laboratories Inc). Finally, the slides were counterstained 
with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and then mounted 
with Permount mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA). Histological images were captured 
from the microscope (Carl Zeiss AX10; Carl Zeiss Meditec 
AG, Jena, Germany) with an objective magnification of X40, 
and high-resolution digital images were acquired and pro-
cessed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Axionvision</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Carl Zeiss Meditec AG</rs>). 
MLKL staining was scored independently by two patholo-
gists and was calculated using a previously defined scoring 
system. 
15,16 Briefly, the proportion of positive tumor cells was 
scored as: 0= less than 5%; 1+=5%-20%; 2+=21%-50%; and 
3+.50%. The intensity was arbitrarily scored as 0= weak 
(no color or light blue), 1= moderate (light yellow), 2= 
strong (yellow brown), and 3= very strong (brown). The </p>

<p>The relationship between the expression of MLKL and 
patient's age, histological type, pathologic grade, and FIGO 
stage were analyzed using the χ 
2 test or Fisher's exact test, as 
appropriate. OS curves and DFS curves were generated using 
the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank 
test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed 
using Cox regression models. P-values less than 0.05 were 
regarded as statistically significant. Data were analyzed using 
the <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 20.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM Corporation</rs>, Armonk, NY,

<p>Statistical analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed with the <rs id="software-0" type="software">PASW</rs> 
Statistics <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 18</rs> for Windows software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chica-
go, IL, USA). To decide which factors are associated with 
compliance among patient characteristics, chi-square 
tests and univariate logistic regression analyses were 
used for categorical variables and continuous variables, 
respectively. In multiple logistic regression analysis, 
variables showing p&lt;0.2 in the univariate analysis were 
included. For multiple analysis, the stepwise forward 
procedure was used for variable entry. </p>

<p>Data are expressed as mean ± SEM of (N) individual samples 
per group. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA com-
bined with Dunnet's or two-tailed Student's t -tests for compar-
ison within the same group or two groups, respectively. Dif-
ferences were considered significant at P &lt; 0.05. The maximal 
inhibitory activity values were calculated and confirmed by non-
linear regression analysis using a <rs id="software-0" type="software">Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">4.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad Software</rs>). </p>

<p>in <rs type="software">Stata</rs>); use of 
ln(FDI) </p>

<p>The sample covers 112 
countries over the period 1970-1997, the dependent variable is FDI inflows as a 
share of GDP, and the proxy for democracy is Polity IV score (see Table 5 for a 
description). We focus on the key regression of the paper: model 10 in Table 4. 
The estimates suggest that a fully autocratic government (score of 0) becoming 
fully democratic (score of 20) can be expected to attract 0.4% more FDI flows 
as a percentage of GDP). Given that the average level of FDI flows in the 
sample is 1.3% of GDP, this is a sizeable amount. 
Table 4 presents our results. Column (1) replicates perfectly the estimates 
found in Jensen (2003). In column (2), we remove the observations identified 
as outliers by the Cook distance, which is a scaled measure of the distance be-
tween the coefficient vectors when a given observation is omitted. Five percent 
of the observations are deemed to be outliers. Their omission has no qualitative 
impact on the results. In column (3) we use an M-estimator, which gives a lower 
weight to observations with large standardized residuals but is not robust to le-
verage points. The estimated impact of democracy falls by half. In column (4), 
the M-estimator is used again, but the sample now only includes observations 
that have not been identified as outliers, and, therefore, potential leverage 
points, in column (2). This is essentially what the <rs type="software">Stata</rs> command -rreg-is doing. 
Results are similar to those in column (4). </p>

<p>A descriptive analysis was conducted to show the characteristics of 
the 134 subjects. Data were summarized as mean and standard 
deviation, median and interquartile range, or frequencies and percen-
tages as appropriate. Comparisons among groups on the crude values 
of oxysterols were made using one-way ANOVA. Tukey's multiple 
comparison post-hoc test was then used to determine significant 
differences between the groups. All statistical analyses were conducted 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 21</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM Corporation</rs>). </p>

<p>All data were expressed as mean AE SEM or percentage. 
Since most continuous variables were skewed, nonparametric 
approaches were used. Quantitative variables between 2 groups 
were compared using the Mann-Whitney test for continuous 
and ordinal variables, and the chi-square test for nominal 
variables. Nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon signed rank) were 
used for comparison of time points within a group. Differences 
among comparison for more than 2 groups were determined 
using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The primary outcome studied 
was in-hospital mortality. 
Univariate analyses were primarily used for the selection 
of variables, based on P value less than 0.1. Selected variables, 
including APACHE II score, SOFA score, Ang-1 levels, Ang-2 
levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate were entered into a 
Cox proportional hazards model to identify the net effects of 
each individual factor. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence 
interval (CI) were used to assess independent contributions of 
significant factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves for day 1 APACHE II scores, plasma levels of Ang-1, 
Ang-2, CRP, and lactate for predicting the development of 
MODS and mortality during ICU stay were plotted, and the 
respective areas under the curves were calculated. A P &lt; 0.05 
was considered statistically significant. All analysis was done 
using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 10.0</rs> (Chicago, IL). </p>

<p>cases, some subjects' data, so costly to collect, may be entirely 
lost to analysis. In studies where it is difficult to find a suf-
ficient number of qualified subjects, exclusion of subjects may 
compromise the research. These problems can become even more 
pronounced in multi-site research protocols that use paper-based 
assessments and centralized data-entry operations (Vessey et al., 
2003). Automated methods are needed to ensure that data are 
complete. 
Electronic data capture (EDC) promises a solution: The data 
are collected electronically and can be validated at the time of 
collection, confirming logical errors or notational problems, and 
ensuring that the required forms are complete. EDC can alleviate 
the need for time-consuming audits, since each subject's data can 
be electronically audited, in a sense, at the time of collection (Kahn 
et al., 2007; Carvalho et al., 2011). The overall progress of a study 
can be monitored more closely during its actual execution and 
incomplete data identified promptly, through the integration of 
EDC methods with data management systems which track subject 
enrollment and other progress. 
Web-based forms for EDC such as those developed by <rs type="software">REDCap</rs> 
(Harris et al., 2009) are extremely useful for either clinician-or 
self-assessment, allowing the subjects to answer the questions on 
their own time in the comfort of their own home over the inter-
net, and the answers can be collated without the introduction of an 
extra transcription step. However, self-assessment may not be an 
option in some situations. In the case of psychiatric assessments, </p>

<p>EDC in <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> </p>

<p>the clinician researcher often must be the person either summariz-
ing or making their best judgment about the subject's response in 
order to complete an assessment, as in conducting the Structured 
Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (Spitzer et al., 1992) or reporting 
the level of consciousness in a neurological assessment of a near-
comatose patient, for example. Interviewers cannot maintain eye 
contact or a comfortable interaction when there is a computer 
monitor between them, which is problematic in various studies; 
having the clinician turn away to type into a web browser may 
be disruptive to assessing body language cues or the flow of the 
interview. 
Electronic data capture methods for research that occurs in 
a medical institution to integrate health records with research 
records (El Fadly et al., 2011) can depend on internet access during 
data collection and integration. EDC methods are also needed for 
studies that need to be performed at locations without internet 
access, remote rural areas, prisons, or mental health facilities that 
do not provide computing resources and may even block internet 
access. These problems make traditional web and desktop software 
impractical for many studies, which in turn keeps these more dis-
tributed clinical studies tethered to paper forms. REDCap is one 
of the few to address this, with a "<rs type="software">REDCap Mobile</rs>" version which 
allows researchers in these situations to have encrypted laptops 
with a push-pull relationship to the centralized REDCap database 
to allow data collection while off-line (Borlawsky et al., 2011). 
A list of current EDC packages are listed in Table 1, with their 
published characteristics. Current web-based EDC solutions suf-
fer from two primary disadvantages, as can be seen: The first is 
the need to have internet access in order to function, which makes 
them unusable in remote situations such as those noted above, with 
the exception of <rs type="software">REDCap</rs>. The second is that many of them are 
integrated into select data management systems. To use a specific 
EDC system one must also use a specific database and presumably 
port any pre-existing data into it. This is less attractive when the 
research group has a mature data management system in place for 
their neuroimaging data, and is looking to add EDC for clinical 
assessments. 
The solution is a system that combines the automated data 
capture of web-based self-assessment with the dynamics of a clin-
ician's expertise and needs, and the abilities to work off-line until </p>

<p><rs type="software">CARAT</rs> IMPLEMENTATION </p>

<p>Linking to other databases. To ensure database platform and 
schema independence, this step is performed by a SOAP web 
service that is individually customized by a software engineer 
associated with the required database platform. This web ser-
vice need be written only once per database schema and then 
applied to all studies that are stored using the same database 
schema. Modification for communication with FBIRN Human 
Imaging Database (FBIRN HID) 2 led to the addition of the 
ability to export assessments in different XML formats. As 
shown in Figure 1, <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> can export the subject's data using 
the XML-based Clinical Experiment Data Exchange (XCEDE) 
schema, which the FBIRN HID uses to import data 3 . </p>

<p>Real-time data validation. The validation steps can be set per 
question per assessment, and can be changed for different vis-
its within a study if needed. They include checking required 
fields for completion, data type (e.g., numeric, character string, 
or date), bounds-checking (e.g., systolic blood pressure is a 
number between 0 and 300), and question dependencies (e.g., 
Question 2 "How many cigarets do you smoke a day?" does 
not need to be answered if the answer to Question 1 "Do you 
smoke?" is NO). <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> provides some complex controls like 
tree selects, and repeating groups of fields, as one might use for 
a medication or drug history. During an interview, the rater is 
notified immediately when a required field is skipped or data 
entered does not meet quality criteria, but the software does 
not require the rater to fix the data immediately. This allows 
the rater to complete the interview smoothly and fix data issues 
at a later time if necessary. CRFs that do not pass data quality 
validation may be stored on the rater's tablet and edited at any 
time, but they may not be submitted to the database until all 
issues are resolved. Examples are shown in Figures 4 and 6. </p>

<p>FIGURE 2 | The workflow for <rs type="software">CARAT</rs>, expanding on the data collection parts of Figure 1. Following study setup, data collection can proceed through the 
needed steps of interviews, validation, correction, addition of other notes or annotations, and final submission. </p>

<p>FIGURE 3 | The data model for <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> is lightweight, combining an 
individual's responses with their study-specific information and 
response validation prior to inserting the information in the database. 
The upper row indicates those parts of the model that draw from study setup, </p>

<p>paper form during an interview, for example; electronic forms can 
allow this kind of rearrangement to be done to allow for a more 
natural interviewing environment. Questions that are not required 
based on the current interviewee's answers may be automatically 
and dynamically hidden. Medication categories are included so 
that drug names can be selected rather than re-typed each time 
they are used. 
In <rs type="software">CARAT</rs>, XML layout specifications for CRFs are created using 
a graphic tool that uses the SOAP web service to pull the question 
metadata from the study protocols already in the database. The 
layout tool is designed for raters or other study staff to use to 
create detailed layouts, including GUI elements and data valida-
tion, with a minimum of technical expertise. Questions may be 
dragged and dropped into a GUI form and then modified as nec-
essary. If metadata about a particular CRF question does not exist

<p><rs type="software">CARAT</rs> USER INTERFACE </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> software has spent the last almost 3 years in long-
term piloting with multiple studies. During this time, it has 
been through three rounds of enhancement in response to user </p>

<p>Figure 4 demonstrates some of the user interface features of 
the prototype. The prototype provides a wide variety of data-
entry methods from simple free text entry to methods of multiple 
choice that may be selected by a mouse click or a pen tap. Sup-
ported forms of data-entry include: Radio Buttons (displayed in 
Figure 4), Checkboxes, Date Selector, Extended Text Drop-Down 
Combo Box (displayed in Figure 5), Free Text Entry, and Tree 
Menus. Free text annotations may be stored for any question by 
clicking the pencil icon or tapping it with the tablet stylus. 
Navigation of lengthy CRFs on paper is often not linear; clini-
cians may skip back and forth as the flow of the interview require. 
To recreate this in <rs type="software">CARAT</rs>, users may navigate through the CRF 
pages using the arrow buttons in the lower right-hand corner, or 
they may go to a specific page using the navigation tree. 
Questions may be skipped based on the answers to other ques-
tions. For example, one question may record if the subject ever 
received a specific diagnosis. If the answer is no, then the sub-
sequent question about the diagnosis is non-applicable and is 
skipped. 
The validation of data types and reasonable responses are 
enforced using regular expressions. If, for example, text is entered 
in a field expecting an integer or an out-of-range response is 
entered, or if a required response is missing, the user is imme-
diately notified with a red exclamation icon. If the cursor hovers 
over the icon, then a specific error message is displayed. 
When Complete or Review buttons at the top of the form are 
clicked, the prototype validates all questions in the CRF and dis-
plays a list of errors for the user to address, as shown in Figure 6. 
Clicking or tapping the error listing takes the user to the question 
that needs to be addressed. CRFs may be edited and saved with 
known errors, but they may not be submitted to the database until 
all errors are addressed. The <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> interface includes the ability 
to create an exception, explaining how the data were not able to be 
collected, if this is the case. This method ensures that an error does 
not obstruct an interview, but that all issues are addressed before 
the data appears in the database. </p>

<p>EVALUATION OF <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> </p>

<p>instrumental in gathering user feedback as well as demonstrat-
ing the usefulness of the software in real assessment gathering 
conditions. We have recently added a self-assessment mode to 
allow the same <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> system to be used in computer labs for 
self-assessments. 
The psychopathy research team currently conducts five related 
studies. The team has been using the tablet application for longi-
tudinal acquisition of clinical and sociodemographic assessments 
on an incarcerated adult psychopathy population since January 
2009 (Ermer and Kiehl, 2010; Harenski and Kiehl, 2010; Harenski 
et al., 2010). The tablet product is ideal in a prison setting, since 
network desktop PC clients are typically disallowed and internet 
access is not available. Among the assessments in use are sev-
eral standard questionnaires, personality checklists, and symptom 
severity indices, which use a broad range of question types and 
answers. Some of them have been modified for specific study 
needs; they are implemented with type-checking (dates, strings, 
numbers) and range-checking where relevant. Assessment data is 
entered in the MRN database, as part of the COINS system (Scott 
et al., this issue). The vast majority of CRFs for the psychopathy 
research studies are now entered via tablet. 
Because the Kiehl psychopathy team phased the tablet entry 
into ongoing studies that had been using manual transcription 
and dual-entry, it is possible to compare the old method to the 
new method to evaluate the effects. For example, as of this writ-
ing, 15,393 assessments were entered manually from paper forms 
into the MRN's database. The average time between the assess-
ment interview and the time the data were verified as complete 
in the database was 232 days. In contrast, 5,567 assessments have 
been entered using the tablet prototype, and the average time 
between interview and complete data in the database is 3 days. 
This trend indicates that assessment data can be made avail-
able for analysis very quickly after it is gathered, and results 
may be available more than 7 months earlier than they would be 
otherwise. 
The FBIRN community has used the tablet application as its 
primary method of assessment gathering for its Phase III schiz-
ophrenia study since January 2009. These assessments are con-
ducted with schizophrenic and normal control participants across 
eight different data collection sites. For this project, we added 
functionality to the current prototype application to support data 
exchange using the XCEDE standard (Keator et al., 2006, 2009). 
Completed CRFs for FBIRN are uploaded to distributed instances 
of the Human Imaging Database, one at each data collection site. </p>

<p>With the exception of the upload of completed CRFs to a data-
base, all major functions on <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> are available without internet 
or network access. Asynchronous updates, however, can lead to 
duplicate or existing data in the centralized data management sys-
tem, which must not be overwritten. REDCap has developed an 
elegant system to manage these issues (Borlawsky et al., 2011); 
<rs type="software">CARAT</rs> handles those problems to some extent, though not as 
completely. At this point, the MICIS and BIRN web services will 
check against the subject ID, assessment, study, and visit to see if 
duplicate data already exists in the database. We are working to 
make the generic web service more flexible and secure for these 
issues while maintaining its agnostic approach to database schema 
Clinical assessment and remote administration tablet was 
designed and implemented on a Windows system. Convertible 
tablets, for which Windows was the dominant operating system, 
are being overwhelmed by the new popularity of slate tablets. Slates 
tend to run Android or iOS, as well as Windows; <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> is being 
re-factored to be platform-independent, to take advantage of these 
new options. 
A challenge specific to multi-site studies is the need to have 
all users have the same implementation of <rs type="software">CARAT</rs>, the same 
forms and layouts. For studies which decide on their protocol 
and never vary from it, it is not a challenge to set up one instan-
tiation of <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> and disseminate it to all the participating sites. 
Many clinical and research studies, however, find that they need 
new or revised CRFs over the course of a study; confirming all 
sites are using the same version has been a challenge for <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> 
in multi-site studies. Future versions of <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> will implement 
automatic update detection, so that all sites are running with the 
latest version for a given study whenever they have internet access. </p>

<p>Electronic data capture of the assessments and interviews associ-
ated with clinical neuroimaging studies have been used in many 
studies, and the <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> system which we present has been tested 
in a wide range of study situations. The needs which EDC sys-
tems commonly address include using a web interface to transmit 
data directly into a database, usually over the internet so that only 
a browser is needed for the user. The ability to handle complex 
forms, multiple types of questions, conditional branching, and 
constraint checking is also needed for an adequate system (Harris 
et al., 2009). Unique needs for many research programs include the 
ability to use a tablet system rather than a desktop or laptop, and 
to work where the internet is not available, without giving up the 
ability to capture the data and transmit it directly to a study data-
base. The demands of neuroimaging studies includes the ability 
to identify the subject's imaging data with their clinical and other 
data, preferably within a centralized multi-modal data repository. 
The first advantage of <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> is that it was designed to work on 
a tablet, mimicking natural interviewing style. The use of the stylus 
on the tablet screen has been popular with researchers who prefer 
the pen and paper approach. <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> also includes the ability to 
handle constraint checking and complex conditional branching, 
similar to what <rs type="software">REDCap</rs> provides. Data validation supports regu-
lar expressions, so error detection can become extremely detailed. 
Responses can be validated not just by data type (date, number, 
character string, etc.) but by complex ranges of these in almost any 
combination. <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> at the moment does not implement the abil-
ity to reference multiple questions in a single validation rule, how-
ever; it can require the response field be filled in according to highly 
complex string-formation rules combining letters and numbers, 
but we can't say that the response must be less the answer to the pre-
vious question plus 100, for example. That has not been a common 
request from users, though it could be implemented if needed. 
An appropriate EDC solution must also provide a high degree of 
CRF customization to accommodate the almost constant stream of 
new assessments, and modifications to existing assessments, which 
comes with many research programs. The CRFs and other assess-
ment forms must be extremely customizable, allowing for entry of 
common, rare, and unique study-specific assessments. It should be 
modifiable by the research team that is collecting and/or managing 
the data, rather than depending on the original software develop-
ers -ease of use in the <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> layout system is currently a focus of 
ongoing development. Ideally, for non-copyright material, a repos-
itory of assessments should be available, built from studies already 
using <rs type="software">CARAT</rs>, so that the forms for a new study can be set up 
quickly and re-use existing forms automatically whenever possible, 
similar to the system implemented in (El Fadly et al., 2011). 
Data-gathering software appropriate to the specific needs of 
clinical research interviews is unlikely to be widely adopted if it 
cannot conform to the data storage solutions already employed at 
mature research sites. It may or may not be possible to integrate 
data from independent software packages that employ their own 
distinct database schemas. The software must be able to plug 
into the existing frameworks already in use by mature research 
programs. It must have a mechanism to communicate with exist-
ing databases and schemas, be they off-the-shelf like <rs type="software">OpenClinica</rs> 
or custom solutions such as <rs type="software">REDCap</rs>. CARAT has the flexibility </p>

<p>to interact with arbitrary databases, rather than a single propri-
etary database specialized for clinical assessments, thus allowing 
the ability of combining clinical and imaging data within a single 
repository. 
Franklin et al. (2011) reviewed several common EDC systems 
within their needs for small-scale clinical trials; their list of val-
ued features overlapped with the <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> specifications to some 
extent. Their list included availability of training materials, the 
presence of site and user roles and permissions, ease of designing 
CRFs including error detection, the ability to create a visit sched-
ule for data-entry, and the ease in importing or exporting data in a 
standards-compliant way. <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> provides training materials for 
the user interface, and the developers' manual for the web interface 
is in development. The fact that <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> is built to work with both 
MICIS and HID and to be expandable to other database system 
means many of the security issues and permissions are considered 
the purview of the database, however, rather than the data col-
lection system. <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> can validate that the rater's username and 
password is a valid rater for the study, and that the subject ID being 
used is for a subject who is enrolled in the study. Other levels of 
permission that are not related to collecting assessment data are 
not within the scope of <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> at this time. </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">CARAT</rs> software is available from www.nitric.org, under mul-
tiple licenses. For the research community with free re-use, it is 
available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). If the 
software is to be used with a commercial interest, other licenses 
can be negotiated. </p>

<p>Flow cytometric analysis of cell apoptosis. To detect cell 
apoptosis, the proliferating phase KUMA5 cells (5x10 
4 clones) 
were trypsinized, washed with cold phosphate-buffered 
saline and resuspended in binding buffer according to the 
manufacturer's instructions of the Annexin V-fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) Apoptosis 
Detection kit (cat. no. KGA106; Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., 
Ltd., Nanjing, China). FITC-Annexin V and PI were added to 
the fixed cells for 20 min in darkness at room temperature. 
Subsequently, Annexin V binding buffer was added to the 
mixture prior to measuring fluorescence using a FACSort flow 
cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Cell 
apoptosis was analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Cell Quest</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">3.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Becton Dickinson</rs>, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). </p>

was used for data analysis. All experiments were repeated 
three times and data are presented as the mean ± standard 
deviation. Differences between groups were analyzed using 
one-way analysis of variance. P&lt;0.05 was considered to indi-
cate a statistically significant difference. </p>

<p>biomarker. Measurements were taken from the participants 
both before commencement of the study and also after the 
yogic intervention was over. Postprandial blood glucose 
levels were measured with a digital glucometer (Accu-
Chek. Sr. no-CN55303545723, Roche Diagnosis, Indianap-
olis, IN, USA). 
Yogic exercises were conducted for about one hour, once 
a week for 12 weeks. The yoga instructor was certificated 
by Bihar Yoga Bharati in India. The yogic exercises were 
done in the Department of Nursing. Cyclic form yoga ex-
ercises were chosen because of the availability of scientific 
studies on this type of yoga 17, 18) . Cyclic yoga exercises 
refers to surya namaskara and yoga nidra. Surya namas-
kara translates as "sun salutations," and this type of yoga 
is composed of 12 postures and breathing exercises. Also 
yoga nidra, which means "psychic sleep," is a specific yo-
gic relaxation and meditation practice 19) . The cyclic yoga 
performed in this study consisted of the following practices 
(Table 1). Under the guidance and supervision of the yoga 
expert, after practicing 10 cycles of surya namaskara for 20 
minutes, the subjects performed the shavasana pose for 5 
minutes of relaxation. Finally, the subjects performed yoga 
nidra. Yoga nidra is performed in the shavasana pose. It has 
several steps, such as resolve, rotation of consciousness, 
awareness of the breath, feeling and sensation, visualiza-
tion, and ending the practice with resolve. 
Statistical analyses were conducted using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> pro-
gram (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.1</rs>) for Windows. All data are presented as 
the mean ± SD. A t test was used to test for the homogene-
ity of demographic and clinical characteristics between the 
exercise and control group. Significant differences between 
groups were determined using unpaired t tests. Significant 
differences within groups were determined using paired t 
tests. The level of statistical significance was considered to 
be a probability value of less than 0.05. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Student's unpaired 
t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests (<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> Windows <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.0</rs>). Relationships between different parameters were assessed 
using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Where appropriate, 
stepwise regression analysis was performed to assess the con-
tribution of various variables to arterial wall properties. Results 
are expressed as mean±SD or median (range). Differences 
were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. </p>

<p>demanding, this problem was less so because of the availability of powerful comput-
ers and software programs such as <rs id="software-0" type="software">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.0</rs> which allow estimates to be performed 
relatively easily. </p>

<p>In plants, short RNAs including » 21-nt microRNA 
(miRNA) and 21-nt trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) 
compose a 'miRNA ! ta-siRNA ! target gene' 
cascade pathway that regulates gene expression at 
the posttranscriptional level. In this cascade, bio-
genesis of ta-siRNA clusters requires 21-nt intervals 
(i.e. phasing) and miRNA (phase-initiator) cleavage 
sites on its TAS transcript. Here, we report a novel 
web server, <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs>, which is developed to 
identify both the clusters of phased small RNAs as 
well as the potential phase-initiator. To detect 
phased small RNA clusters, the <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> maps 
input small RNAs against user-specified transcript/ 
genomic sequences, and then identifies phased 
small RNA clusters by evaluating P-values of hyper-
geometric distribution. To identify potential phase-
initiators, <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> aligns input phase-initiators 
with transcripts of TAS candidates using the Smith-
Waterman algorithm. Potential cleavage sites on TAS 
candidates are further identified from complemen-
tary regions by weighting the alignment expectation 
and its distance to detected phased small RNA 
clusters. The <rs id="software-3" type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> web server is freely 
available at <rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">http://bioinfo3.noble.org/pssRNAMiner</rs>/. </p>

<p>two independent processes (2-5). Phase-initiators direct 
the cleavage of ta-siRNA gene (TAS) primary transcripts 
(precursors) and subsequently initiate the production 
of ta-siRNA clusters (4). To date, only a few known 
phase-initiators are ta-siRNAs as most of reported phase-
initiators are miRNAs. Following cleavage of the pre-
cursor, the 3 
0 (or 5 
0 )-cleavage products are converted into 
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by RDR6 and SGS3. The 
dsRNA is then processed into 21-nt increments, relative to 
the original cleavage site on both strands, by DCL4 in 
order to produce ta-siRNA clusters (3,4). The ta-siRNAs 
form an essential component of the RISC complex 
responsible for guiding AGO-dependent cleavage of the 
target transcript. Based on these data, several researchers 
have proposed a 'miRNA ! ta-siRNA ! target gene' 
cleavage cascade as an element of gene regulatory network 
in the model plant Arabidopsis (4-7). In this paper, we 
describe the development of the <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs>, a plant 
short small RNA regulatory cascade analysis server that is 
able to identify potential ta-siRNAs clusters and their 
phase-initiators. 
While miRNA biogenesis is dependent on the hairpin 
structure of the precursor, the formation of siRNA 
molecules occurs as a result of the processing of dsRNA 
by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs). There-
fore, as compared to miRNA, there is no effective 
computational approach to identify siRNAs from either 
genomic or transcript sequence. Since 21-nt phased 
ta-siRNAs are generated from TAS precursors, it is 
possible to map known small RNA molecules to candidate 
TAS precursors and then cluster these small RNAs based 
on their 21-nt phase properties (8,9). By evaluating the 
P-value of phase features, Chen et al. (6) identified and 
validated a number of known, and several previously 
unknown, ta-siRNA clusters as well as the associated TAS 
gene loci in Arabidopsis. 
TAS precursors require at least one valid cleavage site, 
which is targeted by a phase-initiator to generate ta-
siRNAs. While some TAS genes possess multiple regions 
that are complementary with the phase-initiator, only 
one region effectively guides cleavage in vivo. A 'two-hit 
trigger' mechanism was recently proposed to correlate the 
number of complementary regions with the activity of </p>

<p>phased-initiators based on evidences from studies per-
formed in moss and Arabidopsis (7). Therefore, it is 
anticipated that analysis of both complementary regions 
as well as valid cleavage sites in TAS candidate precursors 
would facilitate screening of phased small RNA clusters. 
In this study, we describe the development of 
<rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs>, a web-based server which identifies 
ta-siRNA clusters as well as their potential phase-
initiators. This program requires that the user submit a 
set of small RNAs and specify one of listed transcript/ 
genomic libraries for mapping. To identify phase-
initiators, the user must submit at least one small RNA 
as candidate phase initiator. The <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> is able to 
identify phased small RNA clusters as ta-siRNA candi-
dates by evaluating the P-values of hypergeometric 
distribution. Furthermore, <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> has the ability 
to identify potential phase-initiators based on the user 
input. To date, <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> hosts 29 transcript/ 
genomic sequence libraries from 20 species. </p>

<p>candidate phase-initiators have the potential to guide 
the cleavage of TAS candidate precursors and trigger the 
biogenesis of phased small RNA clusters identified in the 
first step. 
To perform this analysis, <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> first searches 
the complementary regions between the phase-initiator 
and TAS candidate precursor using the Smith-Waterman 
algorithm (10). It then ranks the alignment of comple-
mentary regions based on a scoring scheme described by 
Zhang (11,12). Since the Smith-Waterman algorithm is 
only able to identify the optimal alignment for each pair of 
query/target sequences, an iterative algorithm has been 
developed to obtain as many complementary regions as 
possible. During each iteration, the identified complemen-
tary region of the precursor sequences are masked by 
'N' letters for the next iterative search until no further 
complementary region(s) can be identified in a given 
query/target sequence. 
Next, the server identifies whether these complementary 
regions have valid cleavage sites, which can result in the 
production of phased small RNA clusters. We applied two 
conditions in this analysis. First, the user-defined cleavage 
site in the complementary region must be located within a 
region calculated by ½B 1 À D,B 2 þ D, where B 1 , start 
position of phased small RNA cluster on the TAS 
precursor; B 2 , end position of phased small RNA cluster; 
D, a user-specific maximum distance between cleavage site 
and start site of small RNA cluster. Second, the distance 
between the cleavage site and start site of the small RNA 
cluster must meet the 21-nt phase property (i.e. multiples 
of 21 nt). </p>

<p>Architecture and implementation of <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> </p>

<p>The <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> consists of two independent compo-
nents, a backend pipeline that is responsible for directing 
the core functions and a web server. The core functions, 
which include the calculation of the P-value and analysis 
of cleavage sites directed by the phase-initiator, are 
performed by the backend pipeline written in <rs type="software">Java</rs> and 
<rs type="software">PERL</rs>. To perform a search for complementary regions, 
a third party software <rs type="software">ssearch</rs> has been used for Smith-
Waterman alignment. The web server was developed on 
top of a SQLite database. Scripts used to generate web 
interfaces and search results were written in <rs type="software">PHP</rs>. </p>

<p>lower than a user specified cutoff threshold (Figure 2a). 
The list view page enables the use of a filtering/searching 
function, in order to remove false positive clusters, such as 
transposon or ribosomal RNAs. In addition, this function 
enables the user to list only those clusters of interest by 
filtering based on specific annotation keywords or IDs. 
The users can further inspect the details of each cluster, 
including phased/nonphased small RNA sequences, the 
location of small RNAs on TAS candidate precursors, 
functional annotation of TAS candidate and valid 
cleavage site, etc. by clicking on the individual cluster 
ID for a detailed view (Figure 2b and c). The users are able 
to further check potential target sequences of these 
detected ta-siRNA candidates by clicking 'search' at the 
end of detailed view. 
Based on user preferences, <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> can also 
identify potential cleavage site guided by phase-initiator 
on TAS candidate precursor. For <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> to per-
form this function, it is necessary for the user to submit 
potential phase-initiators in multi-FASTA format and 
specify the maximum expectation for screening the 
complementary region between the phase-initiators and 
TAS candidate precursors. In addition, it is necessary for </p>

<p>the user to specify the expected cleavage range in the 
complementary region (generally between 9 and 11 nt on 
miRNA sequence) (Figure 1b). After submission, the 
server aligns input phase-initiators with TAS candidate 
precursors to locate complementary regions. Next, the 
server searches valid cleavage sites from the complemen-
tary regions based on the distance between the cleavage 
site and the phased small RNA clusters and output a web 
page that lists clusters with cleavage site information 
(Figure 2a-c). 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> and 
to facilitate its use, we have integrated a number of 
published small RNA datasets into pssRNAMiner. These 
data can be found under the 'dataset' sub-menu. Each 
dataset has been pre-run against their corresponding 
transcript/genomic sequences, and therefore users may 
click links on the right-hand column of dataset table to 
view these precalculated results. </p>

<p>Finally, to evaluate the performance of <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs>, 
we downloaded RDR small RNA MPSS libraries from the </p>

<p>Arabidopsis MPSS Plus database (http://mpss.udel.edu/ 
at/) (13,14). A total of 11 767 distinct small RNA signa-
tures were analyzed based on the Arabidopsis TAIR7 
cDNA release (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/ 
TAIR7_genome_release/). When these data were investi-
gated, <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> detected 124 significantly phased 
small RNA clusters (P &lt; 0.005) at 19 gene loci. Moreover, 
pssRNAMiner detected all the reported ta-siRNA gene loci 
with significant P-value, including TAS1a (AT2G27400),

10 The Court reached its decision by simply 
considering that the price of <rs type="software">Google Maps API</rs>, being equal to 0 €, was necessarily 
lower than the production costs of the service. Interestingly, the Court stopped just 
short of recognizing the implications for competition policy of the two-sided 
business strategy of Google, as it recognized that Google, according to the contracts, 
would be able to insert advertising in its <rs type="software">Google Maps API</rs> service and therefore sell 
targeted advertising. 
Judgements such as the one above may partly be due to the fact that most policy 
contributions so far, such as Wright (2004), have criticized the application of the 
one-sided Areeda-Turner rule to two-sided markets without suggesting an 
alternative. Even those policy contributions, such as Fletcher (2007) or Evans and 
Noel (2008), that recognized the necessity to provide guidance to practitioners fall 
short of providing new applicable methods. In fact, when Google appealed the 
decision of the Commercial Court of Paris, the Court of Appeal of Paris 
11 decided to 
suspend the proceeding and ask the French Competition Authority to deliver an 
opinion on whether Google's conduct had to be considered anticompetitive. 
12 The 
request of the Court of Appeal highlights the uncertainty among practitioners with 
regard to criteria to establish predatory pricing in two-sided markets. 
We contribute to filling this gap by explaining how one should modify the 
Areeda-Turner rule to account for the two-sidedness of a market. Testing for 
predatory pricing in a two-sided market must take into account the presence of the 
indirect network effects between the two sides. Hence, it has to recognize that price-
cost margins on the two sides of the market are interrelated. We thus show that one 
needs to compare the overall price level with the joint marginal cost of the two-sides 
of the market. Since, as already noted by Areeda and Turner (1975), marginal cost 
data are difficult to obtain, one should compare the overall price level with the 
overall average variable cost. </p>

vides, among other things, online map applications that allow users to locate addresses and create 
itineraries online, which compete in France with the equivalent service of <rs type="software">Google Maps API</rs> (Application

doing so Google aimed to extend its dominant position in the market of online search to the connected 
relevant market.

guilty of the abuse of a dominant position pursuant to Article L-420-2 paragraph 1 of the French

ordering Google to publish the judgment at its expense in several French and international newspapers.

sible to review the priorities of alternatives determined af-
ter the evaluation (Fig. 4). According to the results obtained 
in this case, the first contract has the highest priority, the 
second has medium priority and the third has the lowest. 
The model of CCA provisions based on their functions 
has been used for evaluation. No problems related to for-
mation of the evaluation criteria hierarchy have been en-
countered during the evaluation; therefore, it can be claimed 
that the developed model of CCA provisions based on their 
functions meets the requirements applicable to a hierarchy 
and may be used for evaluation of CCAs. 
Analysis of the sensitivity of evaluation helps to deter-
mine the factors which made the greatest influence on the 
evaluation results and whether the provided evaluation of 
criteria significance is correct, to review results of the evalu-
ation of conformity of alternatives with the selected crite-
ria again and to determine opportunities for improvement 
of agreements. On the basis of the results of sensitivity 
analysis, it is possible to claim that evaluation of criteria 
significance meets evaluator's expectations on distribution 
of evaluation results. After the evaluation, evaluation of 
alternatives according to some criteria was slightly modi-
fied. The following possibilities of agreement improvement 
can be specified: 
1) Payment provisions should be improved in the sec-
ond contract. 
2) Payment provisions should be improved in the third 
contract; agreement guarantee and termination pro-
visions should be reviewed. 
Assuming that agreements are final and not subject to 
editing, the first variant must be selected on the basis of the 
evaluation results. However, if an agreement is subject to 
change, the evaluation needs to be repeated after making 
the amendments. Evaluation results may be used not only 
to determine weak points in agreements but also to deter-
mine their advantages, and thus to try improving agreement 
provisions. 
The <rs type="software">Expert Choice</rs> software was used to make pilot 
calculations. This software opens wide opportunities for its 
users. However, it has drawbacks as well. The main draw-
back of this software is that it is adjusted for use in station-
ary work places. The model of indicator hierarchy for con-

extra feature of this software. Meanwhile, users without </p>

<p>One of the main aims of future decision support sys-
tems is the use of IT to increase productivity of people work-
ing in the sphere of information processing in "the age of 
information" and to solve various problems of different 
complexity and structure. Otherwise, people will simply 
fail to evaluate the available information properly and to 
make proper choice with the increasing flood of informa-
tion. This opinion is based on statistical data, which shows 
that the amount of information in a company increases twice 
annually. An employee can analyse only about 5 % of the 
received information effectively in such a situation and as-
sistance becomes vital [12]. Such situation shapes a num-
ber of tasks for a decision support system. 
One of the most important opportunities to develop de-
cision support systems is an increase of their integration. 
First, a system must be developed inside the organisation, 
and such system with a simple user interface would pro-
vide access to and exchange of information among 
company's employees. A clear link between the decision 
support system and various data must be provided and it 
must facilitate installation of various means for resource 
allocation. In this case, accessibility of the system can be 
achieved by using standard graphic user interface. Such 
standardisation is the main reason why <rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> <rs id="software-8" type="software">Windows</rs> 
and related products have become widely distributed so fast. 
The main problem of decision support systems is an inter-
face with additional means that is difficult to implement. 
From the perspective of a user of a decision support sys-
tem, the main criterion when a system for work is being 
selected is the simplicity of its user interface. 
Therefore, the ideas related to information presentation 
must be improved both by the developers and users. A proper 
evaluation of the form (charts, plans, diagrams), in which </p>

<p>the information will be presented in the future, is impor-
tant. There is a chance that new forms of information pre-
sentation may be available in the future, like dynamic charts 
or multi-dimensional reports. 
Use of expert systems and other available AI forms in 
decision support systems determines the main direction. 
Knowledge bases determine the shape of a database or a 
model base, models of conclusion presentation determine 
the knowledge-based management system, and there are 
attempts to develop a user interface in all EU languages. 
One of the issues that is important as well is a closer inte-
gration of decision support systems and software applica-
tions used in a company, thus increasing the level of use-
fulness of decision support and effectiveness of the work 
of a decision-maker as well. 
The consolidating function of a decision support sys-
tem is an important component of the future decision sup-
port systems. It is especially relevant in the sphere of com-
munication. Currently it is possible to connect clients using 
local networks, external networks and other methods, and 
it is the path for further development. Further opportunities 
are standardisation of communication protocols, commu-
nication channels and data presentation allowing to ex-
change large amounts of data, graphic databases, digital 
images and videos. A possibility to connect to other net-
works is important to organisations, because it creates an 
opportunity for emergence of new and more global sources 
of information. The main problem here is security. 
Another opportunity to improve decision support sys-
tems is improvement of accessibility to documents and their 
management both inside and outside of an organisation. 
New search and structuring technologies such as underlin-
ing of an idea, hypertext and multimedia have been rapidly 
developed both for scientific research and commercial pur-
poses. One of the most successful examples thereof is 
groupware, such as <rs corresp="#software-11" type="creator">Lotus</rs> <rs id="software-11" type="software">Notes</rs>, which emerged recently 
and is growing fast. The world becomes a uniform con-
nected whole, which is the basis for further development of 
decision support systems. 
Proper presentation of knowledge creates conditions for 
a system to better reflect expert opinion. These possibili-
ties enable knowledge acquisition; and it is essential in sys-
tems which are used in vital areas where especially valu-
able decisions are made. A possibility to reach documents 
available in different locations and provided by different 
sources using fast search algorithms increases competitive-
ness of companies as well. With increasing importance of 
communication, a decision support system must operate in 
Internet and allow companies to keep up with the newest 
technologies and innovations in decision-making and to 
operate successfully in the expanding cyberspace. 
Cyberspace technologies allow single persons to be in-
volved and participate actively in electronic environment. 
Such computer graphics is based on development of in-</p>

<p>1. Currently, multiple criteria methods and models are 
offered for efficiency improvement when solving various 
issues related to construction; however, preparation, evalu-
ation and comparison of CCAs is still rather disregarded. 
In order that the construction process is effective and 
smooth, the CCA must be properly prepared. In order to 
solve this task successfully, a model of the system of CCA 
provisions has been created. The model is based on func-
tions of provisions. 
2. The model of CCA provisions based on their func-
tions is convenient to determine significance of agreement 
provisions. Then it is possible to develop an Internet-based 
legal CCA decision support system. Such conclusion can 
be made for the following reasons: first, experts can easier 
evaluate significance of agreement provisions grouped ac-
cording to their functions and, second, legal power of all 
CCA provisions is equal, irrespective of the group they are 
attributed to according to any of the analysed classifica-
tions. However, the latter classification illustrates real op-
eration of a CCA and its functions best. 
3. Three CCAs have been selected for calculations and 
evaluation provided as an example. The evaluation has 
shown that the first variant is the most favourable to a cli-
ent, and having analysed graphic information, it is possible 
to determine possibilities for improvement of agreements. 
Software <rs type="software">Expert Choice</rs>, which has been used in this pro-
cess, is well adjusted to development of a good hierarchy, 
to determination of criteria significance, to evaluation and 
analysis of the evaluation results. 
4. The calculations provided as an example enable the 
following conclusion: although the aforementioned soft-
ware has a number of advantages, several main disadvan-
tages can also be distinguished. The software is designed 
for stationary workstations. Thus the developed hierarchi-
cal model of CCA evaluation criteria can be only an extra-
module of the aforementioned software. Whereas users who 
do not have specialised software cannot use the developed 
system of criteria. Although the system foresees a possibil-
ity to place hierarchy models in the Internet, only <rs type="software">Expert 
Choice</rs> software users can use them to full extent. Consid-
ering the results of the analysis, a specialised decision sup-
port system should be developed for CCA evaluation; the 
system would implement advantages of an Internet-based 
system. 
5. Since computer and information technologies are 
developing constantly, it is very important to foresee the 
possibilities to improve a decision support system. The vi-
tal task is to increase system's integration considering the 
trends of development of the aforementioned technologies 
and the purpose of a decision support system. This way a 
user can use the developed system without special training 
or with the minimum training, the need for additional soft-</p>

<p>According to the concept introduced by Christiansen and Bower in 1995, innovations 
could be classified on sustaining, when innovations take place within the existing 
market and Btend to maintain a rate of improvement [providing] customers something 
more or better in the attributes they already value^, and disruptive, when innovations 
Bintroduce a very different package of attributes from the one mainstream customers 
historically value^. The initial version of the concept claimed that in the first phase an 
innovation performs worse than the main product or services in the market but with 
lower prices, and only in the second phase, the quality of the innovation increases and 
attracts the mainstream consumers. However, in more general view, a disruption 
comes not only from the Blow end^, but also from the Bhigh end^(Govindarajan 
and Kopalle 2006) and from a Bnew market^(Christensen and Raynor 2003), and it 
might be claimed that one of the core features of disruptive innovations is their 
financial unattractiveness for the incumbents (Christensen 2006). 
We can find some noticeable examples of disruptive innovations in the telecommunications 
industry: <rs type="software">Skype</rs> that has gained the benefits of the market of long-voice telephony, numerous 
Internet messengers, that partly substituted SMS services or even traditional voice services, or 
Internet video streaming services such as <rs type="software">NetFlix</rs>. However, the majority of these examples 
shares one distinctive feature that, in general, does not entirely fit the concept of disruptive 
technologies: entering the telecommunications market from the outside they have not 
undermined the positions of the incumbents of the industry. 
Indeed, from this point of view these innovations of telecommunications services differ 
significantly from other examples of disruptiveness. The appearance of smartphones subverted 
the market of mobile phones and destroyed the business of the former leader of the market 
Nokia. The introduction of digital photo cameras ruined the business of Kodak. At the same 
time, the appearance of <rs type="software">Skype</rs>, despite of the undeniable significance of the innovation for the 
industry, has not destroyed the business of British Telecom, Deutsche Telecom or Telefonica. 
There are some concerns of the incumbents about Bcommodization^of their services 
(Larouche 2007; Kushida 2015), but it does not mean the loss of their places under the sun. 
The reasons for sustainability of the established players of telecommunications towards 
such kind of disruptive innovations are pretty apparent -these innovations did not attack the 
infrastructure layer of the industry. They have changed the structure and the models of the 
business of incumbents, substituting voice or video traffic by data traffic, but not their 
positions. We can also notice that they broadened the borders of the industry and triggered 
competition on some of its layers, but did not challenge the core. Moreover, even appearance 
of many of these innovations was determined by the development of this core and their 
commercial success was merely impossible before the infrastructure layer reached conditions 
that allowed their proliferation. 
However, even the infrastructure layer of the industry can also be challenged, and history 
shows us the case when the landscape of telecommunications could have been changed by </p>

<p>To predict protein interaction partners for the C-terminus of 
S4D, we first created a database of orthologous proteins, defined 
as the proteins with the smallest average E-value from forward and 
reciprocal <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> searches for two species and the largest 
sequence overlap, from 184 species in the NCBI Entrez database 
[27], while restricting E-values to those less than 1e-5 and 
sequence overlap to greater than 80%. Using this ortholog 
database, we calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient for 
domain-domain interactions between S4D and PDZ domains 
found in human proteins using the Mirrortree methodology as 
described previously [26,28,29]. Briefly, the full protein multiple 
sequence alignments (MSAs) were broken at the domain start and 
end positions. These reduced domain MSAs were used as the 
input for the Mirrortree method, along with the PDZ domains 
found in all other human proteins. </p>

<p>variables. These models generated odds ratios for a given 
fibrosis stage or NAS corresponding to specific increases in 
sCD163 or sCD14. These models included age, gender, race, 
diabetes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate amino-
transferase (AST), and bilirubin as covariates. 
We evaluated the prediction power of sCD163 plus ALT by 
calculating the receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) 
curves. We randomly partitioned the sample into two half-
samples, each containing 50% of the cases (Group 3) and 
50% of controls (Group 2). The first-half sample was used as 
the training set on which we fitted a logistic regression model 
and estimated the coefficients on sCD163 and ALT. 
26 We used 
the second half-sample as the validation set and calculated 
the ROC curve of the score based on the coefficients 
estimated from the training set. We calculated the area under 
the ROC curve (AUROC) for both the training and validation 
sets. The software <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., Cary,

Next, we calculate the inequality based on the parameter sets we obtained above. Here 
we use the best and weighted average parameter sets in bootstrap to calculate individuals' 
welfare without discretizing them, and then we calculate Theil's first and second indices 
and generalized entropy index with γ ¼ −1/2 using R package "<rs type="software">ineq</rs>." Here we use 
generalized entropy index with γ ¼ −1/2 because the metric entropy measure we use is the 
same entropy metric with γ ¼ −1/2. The results are in Table VII. The second column is the 
inequality in reported happiness, where happiness is a discrete variable. The third and 
fourth columns are inequality of welfare S calculated through the best and weighted 
average parameter sets in the bootstrap, using metric entropy measure 1. The fifth and 
sixth columns are inequality of welfare S calculated through the best and weighted 
average parameter sets in the bootstrap, using metric entropy measure 2. The results for 
discrete individual welfare are in Table VIII. When we analyze inequality results, we 
should focus more on results from metric entropy measure 2 because it focusses on the 
similarity of two distributions. It is interesting to note from Tables VII and VIII, that 
inequality in self-reported "happiness" is always higher than that in multidimensional 
welfare based on entropy metric 2. One possible explanation is that this is due to the </p>

<p>Reagents. MCDB-131 medium, FCS, Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit anti-mouse IgG 
and 2Ј,7Ј-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2 DCFDA) were purchased 
from Invitrogen (Paisley, U.K.). Monoclonal (mouse) anti-O-linked N-acetyl-
glucosamine (Clone RL2) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, U.K.). All 
other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, U.K.), 
unless otherwise stated. 
Cell culture. Human microvascular HMEC-1 endothelial cells were cultured 
as described previously (29). HMEC-1 cells (4 -6 ϫ 10 
6 ) were incubated in 
MCDB-131 medium with 10% serum, 10 mmol/l L-glutamine, 10 ng/ml epider-
mal growth factor, and 1 g/ml hydrocortisone in 92-mm-diameter Petri dishes 
with low glucose (5 mmol/l) and high glucose (30 mmol/l) in the absence and 
presence of 4 mol/l sulforaphane for 6 -48 h, trypsinized, and analyzed as 
described below. 
Small interfering RNA transfection. HMEC-1 endothelial cells were incu-
bated in MCDB-131 medium with 10% serum and then transfected with small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) for nrf2 (SI00657030; Qiagen) or transketolase 
(SI02653791) using the HiPerfect transfection reagent according to the man-
ufacturer's instructions. The incubation was then continued with normal 
medium for 24 h. Cultures were then continued with low and high glucose 
concentrations in the absence and presence of 4 mol/l sulforaphane for 6 or 
24 h and/or other additives. Knockdown was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR 
for nrf2 and transketolase. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit 
(Qiagen), reverse transcribed by SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis system 
(Invitrogen), and quantified by real-time RT-PCR using the TaqMan MGB 
probes, designed and supplied by Applied Biosystems. Knockdown was 60% 
for transketolase and Ͼ90% for nrf2. 
Nuclear translocation of nrf2 by immunoblotting. Nuclear and cytosolic 
proteins were isolated from HMEC-1 cells incubated with and without 
sulforaphane using a CelLytic NuCLEAR extraction kit (Sigma). Trypsinized 
cells were washed in PBS at 4°C, and the cell pellet was lysed with hypotonic 
lysate buffer containing dithiothreitol, a protease inhibitor cocktail, and 
IGEPAL CA-630 on ice for 15 min. The lysate was centrifuged (11,000 ϫ g, 30 s, 
4°C), and the supernatant was used for the cytosolic extract. The pellet (crude 
nuclear fraction) was treated with extraction buffer containing dithiothreitol 
and protease inhibitor cocktail at 4°C for 30 min, vortex mixed, and centri-
fuged (21,000 ϫ g, 4°C, 5 min). The supernatant was collected for the nuclear 
extract. All protein extracts were frozen at Ϫ80°C immediately until further 
analysis. The protein concentration was determined with EZQ Protein Quan-
titation kit (Invitrogen). 
Proteins in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were separated by 10% 
SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride 
membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-
buffered saline-Tween buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mmol/l NaCl; 
and 0.05% Tween-20). The membrane was probed with anti-nrf2 antibody 
(H-300; 1:1,500 dilution) overnight at 4°C. After washing, the membrane was 
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:3,000 
diluted; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoconjugate was 
detected with enhanced chemiluminescence. The membrane was then incu-
bated with stripping buffer (100 mmol/l ␤-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 
mmol/l Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered 
saline-Tween buffer, and reprobed with antibodies to reference proteins 
␤-actin and lamin A. Protein band intensities were quantified using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Image-
Quant TL</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Amersham Biosciences</rs>). 
Characterization of biochemical dysfunction. The intracellular formation 
of ROS was detected using the fluorogenic probe H 2 DCFDA. Cells (2 ϫ 10 
6 ) 
were incubated with and without sulforaphane and mitochondrial inhibitors 
for 24 h, washed with PBS, and then incubated further with 20 mol/l 
H 2 DCFDA for 45 min, washed again, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Shorter 
incubations of 1-h preincubation in hyperglycemia with and without mito-
chondrial inhibitors were also performed by microplate fluorescence mea-</p>

<p>Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK), CD3 (Dako, IS503), CD20 
(Dako M0755, clone L26), mast cell tryptase (Dako 
IR640/IS640, clone AA1), and the Dako EnVision Flex 
detection system. Microscopic analyses were performed 
using a Zeiss microscope (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss, Jena, 
Germany) and representative microphotographs were 
taken using a digital camera (AxioCam MRc, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Carl Zeiss</rs>), 
and <rs id="software-0" type="software">AxioVision</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Rel. 4.8</rs>. imaging software (Carl Zeiss). 
The microscopic analysis of the tissue showed skeletal 
muscle fibres (Figure 2A) surrounded by numerous oil 
cysts rimmed by foamy macrophages and multinucleated 
giant cells as well. During the processing of the specimen 
the areas previously filled with oil appear as empty 
spaces. Minimal, thin fibrous fibres can also be recog-
nized between the oil cysts. Moreover, the interstitial tis-
sues contained many mononuclear macrophages with 
small oil droplets and foamy macrophages. There were 
no microscopic signs of a secondary infection; however, 
scattered lymphocytes, mast cells and eosinophilic 
leukocytes were found throughout the lesion. Under po-
larized light, neither birefringent particles nor crystals 
were found within the lesion. The dominant cell type 
within the interstitial tissues was the mature M2 macro-
phage, which showed characteristic expression of the 
CD163 antigen (Figure 2B). The low intra-lesional occur-
rence of the mast cells was proven by immunohistochem-
istry using the specific antibody against mast cell tryptase 
(Figure 2C). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis 
showed a slight dominance of CD3-positive T-lymphocytes 
(Figure 2D) over B-lymphocytes, which showed positive 
reaction to CD20 antibodies (Figure 2E). 
The microscopic aspect of the tissues was identical on 
all occasions. </p>

<p>procedure was accomplished using the Freesurfer package 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 4.5</rs> (Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, 
Charlestown, Massachusetts, USA). This software classifies 
each voxel with a neuroanatomical label based on 
probabilistic information automatically estimated from 
a manually labeled training set. Initially, an optimal linear 
transform was computed to maximize the likelihood of 
the input image based on an atlas constructed from 
manually labeled images. Next, a nonlinear transform 
was initialized with the transformation of the previous 
step, and the image was deformed until a better match of 
the atlas was obtained. Finally, a Bayesian segmentation 
procedure was applied, and the maximum a posteriori 
estimate of the labeling was computed. The technique has 
been previously shown to be comparable in accuracy to 
manual labeling (17). The <rs type="software">Freesurfer</rs> system provides the 
volumes of the classified structures and cortical thickness 
values. 
MTR map. The MTR map is a percent-difference image 
calculated voxel-by-voxel from one pair of identical 
sequences, except for the presence or absence of the MT 
pulse, using the following formula (18): </p>

<p>where (MO) is the signal intensity of the pixel with no MT 
pulse, Ms is the signal intensity of the pixel with the MT 
pulse, and MTR is the magnetization transfer ratio. We used 
the <rs type="software">Mincmath</rs> tool (19) to construct the MTR map for each 
exam. 
Relaxometry map. A natural logarithm (ln) was applied 
in the multi-echo images. A linear equation results from this 
procedure: </p>

<p>where Sr r,TE 
ð 
Þand S 0r r 
ð Þ represent the pixel intensity at the 
positionr r in the image obtained at the TE echo time and 
''ideal'' 0 echo time, respectively. Therefore, a linear least 
squares method can be used to estimate the T2 pixel value 
(T2r r 
ð Þ) from the obtained TE images. The in-house script 
"Relaxon" was implemented for this purpose using <rs type="software">MINC</rs> 
tools. 
Estimation of global measures and cluster analysis. After 
the segmentation, the global measures were computed. The 
following parameters were calculated: </p>

<p>where LRXWM is the white matter relaxometry of the left 
hemisphere and RRXWM is the white matter relaxometry of 
the right hemisphere. 
The patients, based on their MRI characteristics, were 
divided using k-means cluster analyses implemented in 
<rs type="software">Minitab</rs> software, and two groups were formed: cluster 1, 
which had the best results with respect to quantitative MRI 
measures (high volumes and MTRs), and cluster 2, which 
had the worst results (low volumes and MTR values and 
high T2 values). The k-means cluster analysis is used to 
cluster observations into groups when the groups are 
initially unknown. This procedure uses non-hierarchical 
clustering of observations. 
Cluster analysis and comparison. Using the MTR, 
relaxometry, volumes of cortical and subcortical structures, 
white matter areas, and cortical thickness values, we 
compared the clusters with the goal of identifying the 
specific localization of lesions. For this comparison, we 
used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to analyze the normality </p>

<p>The performance of each participant during the neurop-
sychological evaluation was standardized in z-scores 
according to the mean and standard deviation of this study 
group and the signs were inverted for the measures for 
which a higher score indicated a poorer performance, as 
was the case for the measures of processing time. 
These neuropsychological results were divided according 
to the quantitative MRI measures, and a comparison 
between the groups was performed by the Mann-Whitney 
nonparametric test of the <rs id="software-6" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">13.0</rs> for Windows including 
the variables age and schooling. </p>

<p>Here, the operator "defuzz" denotes the centroid method for defuzzification. Centroid 
defuzzification values have been obtained by using <rs type="software">MATLAB R2008a Fuzzy Logic 
Toolbox</rs> as in Fig. 5. </p>

<p>Each sector has its own responsibilities and priorities; 
thus, it is difficult to work together if there is no common 
understanding or mutual interest. However, food safety 
and security is a good example of the intricate link 
between humans, animals, and the surrounding environ-
ment. The question arises as to why we should first apply 
One Health in food safety. First, it is the central issue that 
many sectors pay more attention to, and One Health 
clearly formulates the benefits of cross-sectoral collabora-
tions and sharing of data. Second, the experience of 
cross-sectoral collaboration already exists in this field. 
Finally, it involves food-borne diseases, zoonosis, and 
antimicrobial resistance, controlling of which may ensure 
food security and food safety. 
It is necessary to establish collaborations between 
human and veterinary medicine, food authorities, and 
environmental sectors, and these different sectors should 
collect data from both humans and animals. These data 
include the emerging and reemerging zoonotic pathogens 
(viruses, bacteria, and parasites) and the prevalence, 
variation, genomic data, and the life cycle of the natural 
reservoir, as well as antibiotic use and antibiotic sensi-
tivity. Moreover, a database is needed and should be 
available to scientists from different fields. One successful 
example in Denmark is an automated program referred 
to as <rs type="software">Vetstat</rs>, which has been introduced to collect quan-
titative data regarding all prescribed animal medicines 
from veterinarians, pharmacies, and feed mills to control 
microbial resistance (76). 
One Health mostly emphasized zoonosis in its early 
stage; however, in today's globalized world, it has shifted 
to a broad paradigm, including ecology, sustainable de-
velopment, economics, social justice, equity, and so on 
(77). For public health actors, a broader acceptance and 
understanding of One Health principles could influence 
their thought and values in practice. </p>

<p>Quantitation of colocalization in granules 
The ratio of Msi1-containing granules to total marker-containing granules 
was determined in Fig. 4 B . The percent colocalization (Fig. 4 B; 1) was 
estimated as described previously ( Barbee et al., 2006 ). The weighted 
colocalization coeffi cients (Fig. 4 B; 2) were calculated using <rs id="software-3" type="software">LSM Image

<p>Total DNA was isolated from tissues by proteinase K di-
gestion and standard phenol-chloroform extraction. 
Southern blotting was performed essentially as previously 
described (21). Briefly, 3 mg total DNA was digested with 
SacI overnight at 37 
C, samples were then separated by 
electrophoresis in an agarose gel and blotted by alkaline 
transfer onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham 
Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized overnight at 
68 
C in a roller hybridizer using 5 mCi/ml 
32 P-dCTP 
labeled (PCR-generated) mouse mtDNA probe, and 18S 
rDNA probe in pBR322 plasmid. Phosphoimager analysis 
was done with Typhoon 9400 (Amersham Biosciences) 
and mtDNA was quantified against the 18S rDNA

Dissociation curves were checked to ensure the existence 
of a single PCR product. Each sample was run in dupli-
cate, and samples with significant variation between du-

<p>scope. Confocal images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta 
confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil 
objective. Time-lapse series of HUVECs expressing the single-
chain Raichu/Cdc42 FRET probe (Aoki and Matsuda, 2009) were 
collected every 1 min for 30-60 min on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal 
microscope equipped with Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.4 oil objective. 
Images were collected every minute for a total of 30-60 min. For 
ultrastructural analysis, collagen gels were prepared for trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM). Briefly, gels were fixed with 
2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 75 mM phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 h at 4°C, followed by overnight 
wash in 114 mM PBS. Gels were subsequently postfixed in 1% 
OsO 4 reduced with 1% K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] in 1 M cacodylate buffer for 
1 h at 4°C, washed twice in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and embed-
ded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut, mounted onto copper 
grids, and viewed with a Morgagni 268 transmission electron 
microscope (FEI). Digital images were acquired with a Mega-
ViewIII camera controlled with <rs id="software-0" type="software">iTEM</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Olympus Soft Imaging Systems</rs>, Germany) and then postprocessed using 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD</rs>) and <rs type="software">Adobe 
Illustrator</rs>. </p>

<p><rs type="software">Fiji</rs> was used for image processing and extraction of quantitative 
data. For quantitative analysis of VE-cadherin, PDXL, active 
Cdc42, and p-aPKC, the average fluorescence intensity in regions 
of interest (ROIs) located in the luminal area was measured using 
<rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> software. A total of 35-50 ROIs from 3D images pooled 
from three independent experiments was analyzed. To determine 
VE-cadherin junctional length and the percentage of luminal pe-
rimeter coated with PDXL, the line scan function of <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> was 
used on 25-30 junctions/lumens from three independent experi-
ments. Images from FRET time-lapse series were processed with 
<rs type="software">Fiji</rs>. Briefly, a binary mask was derived from the YFP image and 
was multiplied separately with the TFP and FRET images. Then 
FRET images were divided by TFP images to obtain FRET/TFP 
ratio images. A rainbow color LUT was applied, and brightness 
and contrast were adjusted to display the ratio FRET images in an 
intensity-modulated manner by which red indicates high and blue 
indicates low FRET efficiency, respectively. For quantitative analy-
sis, YFP-masked FRET and TFP images were thresholded to 
measure pixel intensity of each individual image in the stack, and 
FRET/TFP intensity ratios were calculated as previously described 
(Chaki et al., 2013). For statistical purposes, time-lapse series 
were acquired from four to six cells/group. Experiments were 
repeated three times. </p>

<p>Analyses and visualization of data were performed in R (ver-
sion 3.1.1) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">RStudio</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 0.98.994</rs>). All samples had 
passed standard diagnostic quality control criteria [4, 6, 31]. 
Equivalence of MammaPrint indices was determined by 
the Pearson correlation for assessment of the degree of 
linear correlation, and a Passing-Bablok regression analysis 
to obtain the regression equation. Bland-Altman plots were 
used to visually examine the existence of any constant bias 
in the difference of measurements between paired samples. 
The Bland-Altman analysis allows visual identification of 
any proportional error (if data points show an angled linear 
association), systemic error (if the horizontal mean differ-
ence line of the data points is shifted parallel away from 
zero), or dependence of a method on the magnitude of 
measurements (if data points show an association that 
widens or narrows from left to right). 
Clinicopathological data and clinical outcome data of 
the 345 patient samples were analyzed using the statistical 
package <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">22.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SPSS Inc</rs>, Chicago, US). 
Survival analyses were performed to compare clinical 
performance of fresh and FFPE tissues. Kaplan-Meier 
analyses were used to compare the survival distributions of 
MammaPrint for fresh and FFPE for distant metastasis as 
first event (DMF) and distant recurrence-free interval 
(DRFI). DMF was defined as the time from surgery until 
the diagnosis of a distant metastasis as first event. For 
DMF, patients who present with a local recurrence, 
regional recurrence, or second primary tumor before the 
diagnosis of a distant metastasis were censored at such 
event, at death or at the end of follow-up. DRFI was 
defined as the time from surgery until the diagnosis of a 
first distant metastasis or breast cancer-related death. 
Reproducibility of the MammaPrint test was tested by 
evaluating diagnostic controls over a period of 10 years to 
assess nearly all sources of variation in n = 11,333 sam-
ples. Reproducibility was measured in terms of the relative 
stability, calculated as 100 minus the relative standard 
deviation, where the standard deviation was measured as a 
percentile of the total MammaPrint range [31]. To enable 
assessment of MammaPrint stability of repeated control 
sample measurements over time and independent of control 
sample, MammaPrint indices were centered on their indi-
vidual sample mean per RNA reference type. 
The analytical performance of the current MammaPrint 
fresh and FFPPE versions was assessed in a precision </p>

<p>Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions-C. glutamicum

To delete aftE, the deletion vector pK19mobsacB⌬-aftE was 
made, and crossover PCR was used with genomic DNA of

uct contained 18 nucleotides of the 3Ј-end of the respective 
gene together with genomic upstream sequences and 36 nucle-
otides of the 5Ј-end together with genomic downstream 
sequences. All plasmids used in this work were confirmed 
by sequencing. AftE was deleted by electroporating 
pK19mobsacB⌬-aftE into C. glutamicum and then selecting for 
sucrose resistance (30). Chromosomal deletions were con-
firmed using primer pairs AD as well as the additional new 
primer pairs EF (overhangs required for hybridization are given 
in italics in supplemental Table 1) hybridizing outside of the 
regions used for plasmid constructions. To construct pEKEx2-
Cg-aftE, Cg-aftE was amplified using primer pairs AD, with the 
former providing the sequence CTGCAG as a ribosome bind-
ing site. The amplified product was ligated between PstI and 
EcoRI in pEKEx2. Plasmid pEKEx2-Cg-aftE was electroporated 
in C. glutamicum ⌬aftE, resulting in C. glutamicum ⌬aftE 
pEKEx2-Cg-aftE. 
Extraction and Biochemical Characterization of Lipoglycans-
Lipoglycans were extracted from delipidated cells as described 
previously (31, 32) and treated with H 2 O 2 before immunologi-
cal assays to remove any endotoxin contamination (13) and to 
yield a negative Limulus amebocyte lysate test using E-TOXA-
TE 
TM (Sigma-Aldrich). For MALDI-TOF-MS, 2,5-dihydroxy-
benzoic acid was used as a matrix, and samples (0.5 l; 10 
g/l) were analyzed on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF 
instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) using linear mode detec-
tion. Furthermore, lipoglycans were derivatized for glycosyl 
and linkage analysis as described previously (31). All of the data 
were collected and analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Xcaliber</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 1.2</rs>). 
HEK293 Cell Culture and Stimulation Assay-Human 
HEK293 cells transfected with TLR2 (33) were cultured as 
described previously (13). For stimulation assays, trypsine-re-
leased HEK293 cells were washed with and resuspended in cul-
ture medium at 5.55 ϫ 10 
5 cells/ml, after which 90 l of cell 
suspension (5 ϫ 10 
4 cells) was transferred to a 96-well U-bot-
tom plate (Greiner) and left for 2 h to let the cells re-adhere. 
After this, cells were stimulated (in triplicate) with 50 g/ml 
LAM or hLM in a final stimulation volume of 100 l. Non-
stimulated cells and cells stimulated with 50 ng/ml Pam3CSK4 
served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Culture 
supernatants were harvested after 24 h by centrifugation and 
analyzed for IL-8 content using ELISA (Invitrogen). </p>

tion of cytokines, specific antibodies for IL-17 (phycoerythrin, 
eBio17B7; eBioscience) and IFN-␥ (FITC, XMG1.2; eBiosci-

Statistical Analysis-One-way ANOVA post hoc Tukey's t 
test was used with a confidence interval of 95% when multiple 
comparisons were evaluated. Two-way ANOVA was used in 
kinetic evaluations. Data were expressed as means Ϯ S.E.; p Ͻ

<p>Human CD34+ (hCD34+) cells were isolated from the cord blood of 
consenting healthy mothers according to approved procedures. 10 
5 hCD34+ 
cells per mouse were intravenously injected into sublethally (200 cGy) 
irradiated NSG mice and peripheral blood was analyzed for the appearance 
of hCD45+ cells by flow cytometric analysis every 2 − 4 weeks. Human 
grafts were treated with either vehicle, selinexor (20 mg/kg twice a week 
for PDX AML-CN and three times a week for AML-CK and AML/MDS) 
or KPT-8602 (15 mg/kg daily) for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, 
mice were killed and bone marrow was isolated from the femurs and tibias 
of 5 − 7 animals from each experimental group. The drug response of mice 
in each experimental group was measured by the percent infiltration 
of hCD45+ cells among the bone marrow leukocytes and total hCD45+ 
cell per femur and tibia. To determine the toxicity of drugs against 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), serial dilutions of hCD34+ cells isolated 
from the bone marrow of femurs and tibias of mice from each 
experimental group after 4 weeks of treatment were transplanted into 
new recipient animals. After 18 − 22 weeks, cohorts of mice transplanted 
with dilutions of hCD45+ cells were analyzed for the presence of hCD45+ 
in the mouse bone marrow, following the same procedures as described 
for secondary transplantation assays for the analysis of LIC frequencies. 
The fractions of mice that demonstrated hCD34+ engraftment per total 
number of animals in each dilution cohort were used to determine the HSC 
frequency by <rs type="software">Extreme Limiting Dilution</rs> software. The following antibodies 
were used for flow cytometric analysis: hCD45, hCD33 (Biolegend, San 
Diego, CA, USA), hCD34 and hCD38 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). </p>

<p>Percent and total hCD45+ cells in the bone marrow are presented as 
means ± s.e.m. Differences between experimental groups were determined 
with an unpaired Student's t-test. LIC and HSC frequencies were estimated 
from results of the secondary transplantation assays using <rs id="software-3" type="software">Extreme 
Limiting Dilution</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda</rs>/). </p>

<p>The mean values of the parameters were

<p>Crystal diffraction data of apo-ACP and FabZ-ACP complex 
were collected at beamline BL19U1 at the National Center for 
Protein Sciences Shanghai and Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation 
Facility, China. Significant decay of the complex crystals during 
data collection caused the resolution cut off at 2.55 Å. While the 
crystal diffraction data of holo-ACP were collected at 100 K using 
CuKα X-ray with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ image plate. The data 
were further processed using <rs type="software">HKL2000</rs> software package [47] and 
<rs type="software">CrystalClear</rs> software. The structures were solved by MR with the 
published structure of apo-EcACP (PDB code: 1T8K) and Hp-
FabZ (PDB code: 2GLL) as search models, and refined by using 
programs <rs type="software">Phenix</rs> [48] (complex) and <rs type="software">CNS</rs> (apo and holo-ACP). 
The crystallographic statistics are summarized in Supplementary 
information, Table S1. Electron density interpretation and model 
building were performed using the computer graphics program 
<rs type="software">Coot</rs> [49]. Final structures were visualized by PyMol software. </p>

<p><rs id="software-16" type="software">SYBYL</rs> package (<rs corresp="#software-16" type="url">www.tripos.com</rs>) was used to prepare the 
fatty acid chains and the protein structures used in docking. Initial 
structures of fatty acid chains in different lengths (4-to 16-carbon 
chain) were sketched using the <rs type="software">SYBYL</rs> program with standard 
geometric parameters, and Gasteiger-Hucker charge was added. 
All fatty acids were then optimized using the standard TRIPOS 
force field with Gasteiger-Hückel charges until the energy gradient 
converged to below 0.05 kcal/mol. Waters in the crystal structure 
of FabZ were removed, and all hydrogens were added. Kollman 
all-atom charges were assigned for FabZ and Gasteiger-Hückel 
charge was computed for residue 36 with 4′-Pan-arm. 
Genetic algorithm-based docking program <rs type="software">GOLD</rs> was used 
for molecular docking simulations [50]. Fatty acid chain-binding 
site for docking was defined as a collection of all atoms within 25 
Å around the midpoint of the terminal S of the 4-Pan-arm and O 
atom of Lys97, so the active site would be big enough to include 
the possible binding sites of variable length fatty acid chains. The 
GOLDScore fitness function was employed in scoring conforma-
tions. The parameters for GOLD were as follows: numbers of GA 
ran 50, no early termination was allowed and all other parameters 
were used as default (Supplementary information, Table S3). </p>

<p>FabZ-ACP complex purified from gel-filtration in the solution 
containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM 
DTT was used in the Synchrotron SAXS experiment. The mea-
surement was performed in a vacuum cuvette with exposure time 
of 1 s to diminish the parasitic scattering under wavelength 1.03 Å 
at National Center for Protein Sciences Shanghai (NCPSS) beam-
line BL19U2, China. The scattering was recorded in the range 
of the momentum transfer 0.015 &lt; s &lt; 0.420/Å, where s = (4π × 
sinθ)/λ and 2θ is the scattering angle. SAXS data were subsequent-
ly processed and analyzed by using the <rs type="software">ATSAS</rs> program suite 
[51]. Briefly, program <rs type="software">PRIMUS</rs> [52] was employed to process the 
experimental scattering data and correct the solvent background 
scattering. Program <rs type="software">CRYSOL</rs> was used to generate the theoretical 
scattering from the FabZ-ACP complex crystal structure [53]. Pro-
gram <rs type="software">GNOM</rs> was employed to calculate the distance distribution 
function p(r) (Figure 5C and 5D) [54]. Subsequently, programs 
<rs type="software">DAMMIN</rs> [55], <rs type="software">GASBOR</rs> [56] and <rs type="software">DAMAVER</rs> [57] were used 
to reconstruct the low-resolution shapes to a dummy atom particle 
model, and superpose to the crystal structure (Figure 5E). The

<p>MST assay is a new immobilization-free and titration-based 
technology for biomolecule interaction determination [58]. The 
assay was performed with a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instru-
ment (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH). Briefly, FabZ or FabZ 
(Y100A) was labeled with fluorescence dye NT-647 (amine-re-
action) according to manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, 50 
nM of labeled protein was mixed with various concentrations of 
holo-ACP in the reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM fresh DTT and 0.05% Tween 20. After in-
cubation for 5 min under room temperature, 10 µl of the mixtures 
were loaded into premium coated capillaries for measurement. The 
MST data were then collected under 40% infrared laser power and 
20% light-emitting diode power. Nanotemper analysis software 
(1.5.41) was used to fit the independent experimental data and de-
termine Kd and standard deviation value. The figure was generated 
by using <rs corresp="#software-29" type="creator">GraphPad</rs> <rs id="software-29" type="software">Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-29" type="version-number">5</rs>. </p>

<p>undertaken by humans, including negotiation. Negotiations are consequently being con-
ducted by means of the electronic media, starting with simple phone calls, through the 
videoconferences, online chatting, with the use of software negotiation support system 
(NSS), ending with the electronic negotiation system (ENS) -a software that employs 
Internet technologies and is deployed on the web for the purpose of facilitating, organ-
izing, supporting and/or automating activities undertaken by the negotiators and/or the 
third party (Kersten and Lai 2007). More and more people and organizations are decid-
ing to negotiate electronically, since it saves time and money and allows to develop and 
maintain the business contacts regardless of the distance of time and space between the 
counterparts. Therefore, the negotiation support tools are still being developed to make 
the negotiation process more fluent and bring negotiators closer to the most satisfying 
agreement. Usually, these systems implement the formal models deriving from opera-
tional research and decision science that are used to help negotiators define negotiation 
space, evaluate offers and determine efficient solutions. There are a lot of NSSs and 
ENSs that have been used for simulating, training and teaching negotiations or for 
research purposes like <rs id="software-12" type="software">INSPIRE</rs> (Kersten and Noronha <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-date">1999</rs>), <rs id="software-13" type="software">Negoisst</rs> (Schoop et al. 
<rs corresp="#software-13" type="version-date">2003</rs>), NeGoGo (Lai et al. 2007) or <rs id="software-14" type="software">NegoCalc</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-14" type="creator">Wachowicz</rs> <rs corresp="#software-14" type="version-date">2008</rs>). Lots of theoretical 
and practical solutions for electronic negotiation support are also proposed in the lit-
erature, that focuse on both the methodological and applicational aspects of electronic 
negotiations (see Stroebel and Weinhardt 2003; Urbanavičienė et al. 2009a, b). Unfor-
tunately, there are only a few examples of using the formal models and systems in the 
large and complex real-world negotiations of business or political nature. One of them 
was introducing the Deep Ocean Mining Model into the United Nations' UNCLOS III 
negotiations (Sebenius 1984) concerning the rights to exploit the deep sea. It allowed 
to make a consensus between the developed and developing countries according to the 
profits sharing. Another system, developed by International Institute for Applied System 
Analysis, is RAINS (Hordijk 1991), which was used in the international negotiations 
between the European countries on the air pollution limits. Some other systems are still 
being developed to support real-world problems like <rs id="software-16" type="software">Familly_Winner</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-16" type="creator">Bellucci and Zeleznikow</rs> <rs corresp="#software-16" type="version-date">2005</rs>) designed on Victoria University, Australia, for supporting divorcing 
disputes or <rs id="software-17" type="software">Smartsettle</rs> (Thiessen and Soberg <rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-date">2003</rs>), which is now being adapted to 
support negotiations between First Nations and the Government of Alberta Province in 
Canada (Thiessen and Shakun 2009). </p>

<p>Having completed all four steps of the above procedure we obtain a full scoring system 
of the feasible offers. Negotiators can use this system to compare proposals submitted 
by their counterparts and analyze the differences between quality (satisfaction rate) of 
the subsequent offers (that have the interval scale interpretation). Negotiators can also 
observe how the score is determined while the options are added or changed within the 
offer they prepare. The system allows also to follow the negotiation progress by analyz-
ing the concession paths -the shape of the graph built with scores of successive offers 
submitted both by the negotiator himself and his counterpart. Such a solution is com-
monly applied in the NSS, for example in <rs id="software-18" type="software">Inspire</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-18" type="creator">Kersten and Noronha</rs> <rs corresp="#software-18" type="version-date">1999</rs>), Smartset-
tle (Thiessen and Soberg <rs corresp="#software-20" type="version-date">2003</rs>) or <rs id="software-20" type="software">Negoisst</rs> (Schoop et al. 2003). An example of scoring 
negotiation offers with additive scoring system in <rs type="software">Inspire</rs> ENS is shown in Fig. 2. </p>

<p>Even-swap based scoring system was applied in a simple spreadsheet based negotia-
tion support tool called <rs id="software-22" type="software">NegoCalc</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-22" type="creator">Wachowicz</rs> <rs corresp="#software-22" type="version-date">2008</rs>). The key stages of building the 
negotiation offers' scoring system in NegoCalc are shown in Fig. 3. First the base issue 
has been selected as the price, and then, after identification of the best options for all 
remaining issues (building time and warranty time), the equivalent amounts for even 
swaps in terms of price have been declared. </p>

<p>Both an additive scoring system and even-swap based scoring system can be used in 
the offer's formulation process for analyzing in details the trade-offs between issues and 
options. While building the offer (i.e. adding the propositions for reservation levels of 
successive issues) negotiator can observe how the overall score changes. He can im-
mediately react if the score is lower than his aspiration level by balancing with different 
combination of options (increasing value of one issue, while decreasing it for another). 
The process of building negotiation offer in <rs type="software">NegoCalc</rs> system is presented in Fig. 7. </p>

<p>These two scoring systems may be also helpful in graphical illustration of the negotia-
tion progress. A graph depicting the history of offers in the evaluation (utility) space 
can be used to analyze the dynamics of negotiation -how frequently the offers and 
counteroffers are submitted and what outcome they produce. It is also very useful in 
recognizing the scale of successive concessions, basing on which negotiators can con-
clude on their counterparts negotiation strategy. An example of a history graph displayed 
in ENS <rs id="software-24" type="software">Inspire</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-24" type="creator">Kersten and Noronha</rs> <rs corresp="#software-24" type="version-date">1999</rs>) is presented in Fig. 8. </p>

<p>digital radiographs of each hip were examined 
retrospectively by two independent blinded observers (E.T, 
C.P.), neither involved in the clinical care of the patients. 
Stem subsidence at two years postoperatively was measured 
by the two observers, as a change in the vertical distance 
from the proximal tip of the greater trochanter to the 
shoulder of the stem [8]. A computer-assisted method was 
used to perform these measurements. The radiographs were 
originally DICOM and transformed into TIFF greyscale 
format without compression. These digital images were 
processed via <rs id="software-0" type="software">Roman</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v1.7</rs> software (Roman software 
version V1.70; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital</rs>, Oswestry, UK; http://www.cookedbits.co.uk/roma

for orthopaedic applications in general. Its accuracy has 
already been demonstrated for the measurement of 
polyethylene wear, where the determination of bone and 
prosthesis landmarks is automated by the computer using an

successfully used in stem migration analyses [14]. </p>

<p>Cortical Index (CI), stem alignment and canal fill were 
also assessed, with the use of <rs id="software-3" type="software">Roman</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">v1.7</rs>. CI was calculated 
at a level 100 mm below the middle of the lesser trochanter 
and Dorr's bone quality for each patient was assigned [15]. 
Varus or valgus malalignment of the stem was defined as 
deviation from the longitudinal femoral axis of &gt; 3° on the

<p>Open Field Test 
An activity chamber (60 × 60 × 30 cm) with a black floor divided 
into 16 squares of an equal area (15 × 15 cm) by white lines was 
used to study 3'-dA-induced hyperactivity. After 3 days of i.p. 
injection of drugs, mice were placed in the center of the cham-
ber and their behavior was recorded for 60 minutes. Total dis-
tance traveled and the amount of distance traveled in the center 
area (the 4-square area in the middle of the chamber) were ana-
lyzed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">Anymaze system</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Stoelting</rs>). </p>

<p>PFC or HIP tissue was lysed with an ice-cold radioimmuno-
precipitation assay buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 
1% Triton X-100, sodium pyrophosphate, β-glycerophosphate, 
EDTA, Na 3 VO 4, leupeptin plus a Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet 
[Roche], and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet [Roche]) in 
a tissue grinder (Wheaton). Protein concentrations were deter-
mined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). 
Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 7-10% SDS-PAGE 
gels electrophoresis, then transferred to polyvinylidene dif-
luoride (PVDF) membranes (Pall) and blocked with 1% BSA in 
TBST (0.1% Tween). Antibodies against Phos-GluR1 S845 (Rabbit 
mAb, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and GluR1 (Goat pAb, 
1:1000, Santa Cruz) in 5% BSA-TBST were applied to the mem-
branes. The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxi-
dase conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:5000, Affinity Bioscience) or 
donkey anti-goat antibodies (1:5000, Santa Cruz). Antibody for 
β-actin (Mouse mAb, 0.2 μg/ml, Affinity Bioscience) was applied 
for loading calibration. Immunoreactive bands were visualized 
using the ECL detection system (Millipore). Images were acquired 
by the FlourChem E image system (FE0511, ProteinSimple) and 
quantified by the <rs id="software-1" type="software">Image-Pro Plus</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">Version 6.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Media Cybernetics</rs>). </p>

<p>All data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post hoc 
Bonferroni (unequal sample) or Tukey (equal sample) tests and 
presented as the mean ± standard error via SPSS 17. A p-value

<p>simpler answer is to use software such as <rs type="software">EViews</rs>, <rs type="software">SAS</rs>, <rs type="software">GAUSS</rs>, <rs type="software">TSP</rs>, <rs type="software">Matlab</rs>, <rs type="software">RATS</rs> 
and many others where there exist already packaged programs to do this. 
But the process is not really mysterious. For any set of parameters , ␣, ␤ and 
a starting estimate for the variance of the first observation, which is often taken to 
be the observed variance of the residuals, it is easy to calculate the variance forecast 
for the second observation. The GARCH updating formula takes the weighted 
average of the unconditional variance, the squared residual for the first observation 
and the starting variance and estimates the variance of the second observation. This 
is input into the forecast of the third variance, and so forth. Eventually, an entire 
time series of variance forecasts is constructed. Ideally, this series is large when the 
residuals are large and small when they are small. The likelihood function provides 
a systematic way to adjust the parameters , ␣, ␤ to give the best fit. 
Of course, it is entirely possible that the true variance process is different from 
the one specified by the econometrician. In order to detect this, a variety of 
diagnostic tests are available. The simplest is to construct the series of { t }, which 
are supposed to have constant mean and variance if the model is correctly specified. 
Various tests such as tests for autocorrelation in the squares are able to detect 
model failures. Often a "Ljung box test" with 15 lagged autocorrelations is used. </p>

<p>Applications of the ARCH/GARCH approach are widespread in situations 
where the volatility of returns is a central issue. Many banks and other financial 
institutions use the concept of "value at risk" as a way to measure the risks faced by 
their portfolios. The 1 percent value at risk is defined as the number of dollars that 
one can be 99 percent certain exceeds any losses for the next day. Statisticians call 
this a 1 percent quantile, because 1 percent of the outcomes are worse and 
99 percent are better. Let's use the GARCH(1,1) tools to estimate the 1 percent 
value at risk of a $1,000,000 portfolio on March 23, 2000. This portfolio consists of 
50 percent Nasdaq, 30 percent Dow Jones and 20 percent long bonds. The long

volatility and great anxiety. 
First, we construct the hypothetical historical portfolio. (All calculations in this 
example were done with the <rs type="software">EViews</rs> software program.) Figure 1 shows the pattern 
of returns of the Nasdaq, Dow Jones, bonds and the composite portfolio leading up 
to the terminal date. Each of these series appears to show the signs of ARCH effects 
in that the amplitude of the returns varies over time. In the case of the equities, it 
is clear that this has increased substantially in the latter part of the sample period.

Customized antibody microarrays for quantification of BRCA1 
(antibody #sc-1553, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, 
Germany) and several other DNA repair-associated proteins 
(ATM, BRCA2, MLH1, RAD51 and TP53) were prepared by 
spotting triplicate drops, each containing approximately 0.5 pg 
antibody onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Oncyte, nitrocellulose 
16 multi-pad slides, Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR), using a sciFLEX-
ARRAYER 3 non-contact spotter (Scienion, Berlin, Germany). 
Antibodies against β-actin (ACTB) (#A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, 
Munich, Germany) served as positive, spotting buffer as nega-
tive control. Slides were stored at 4°C in dry condition. Nuclear 
proteins were labeled with an amine reactive fluorine dye, which 
forms a covalent amide bond between the primary amines of 
proteins. Two micrograms of protein and 0.12 μl fluorescent dye 
(Dylight 649 NHS Ester, Pierce, Rockford, IL) were incubated 
for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Then, excess fluores-
cent dye was inactivated by adding 100 mM glycine to the reac-
tion. Prior to use, antibody microarrays were covered with 16-pad 
FAST frame hybridization chambers (Whatman, Maidstone, 
UK). Unspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at 4°C with 
120 μl PBS containing 4% non-fat dry milk per subarray, fol-
lowed by three washes with 120 μl PBS each for 10 min. Labeled 
protein samples were incubated on subarrays overnight at 4°C. 
Afterwards, the slides were washed two times for 15 min with 
PBS, 5% Tween 20 and two times for 15 min with HPLC-grade 
water. Finally, the slides were dried in a SpeedVac and scanned 
with a high-resolution confocal Affymetrix array scanner 428 TM

formed according to the formula: spot intensity = mean intensity 
SP -[(sum bkg -sum top25 bkg)/(number of pixelSP -number 
of pixel top25 bkg)], where SP represents any spot, bkg the corre-
sponding background and top25 bkg the top 25% of background 
pixel. Microarray data were analyzed using log10 transformation,

<p>Objectives: Extraarticular Reconstructions (ERs), isolated or in association with Intraarticular ACL Reconstructions 
(IRs) were popular in the eighties. However they were almost completely given up as a result of a consensus 
conference organized by AOSSM in 1989 in Snowmass (Co) where the experts concluded that ERs, even if 
biomechanically justified, were unable to provide any improvement in clinical results with greater morbidity, higher 
risk of complications and increased rate of degenerative osteoarthritis (DOA). However, as since then the surgical 
techniques and postoperative rehabilitation have radically changed, it could be helpful to reconsider ERs and their 
long term effect on knee stability and on DOA. 
Methods: One hundred consecutive patients who underwent an anatomic single bundle ACL reconstruction with 
hamstrings were re-evaluated at a minimum follow up of eleven years. In 23 cases (group B), due to the presence 
of a Pivot Shift test graded as +++ or in cases of athletes involved in high risk sports, a lateral tenodesis 
(Coker/Arnold) was associated. The other 77 patients, where an isolated IR was performed with the same technique 
(group A), served as control. All patients followed the same, standard postoperative rehabilitation program. At 
follow up Lysholm, IKDC and Tegner activity scores were used. A side to side maximum manual (S/S MM) KT1000 
measurement was done. Comparative weight bearing antero-posterior and lateral radiograms were performed and 
analyzed according to Fairbank, Kellgren and IKDC classification. Tibio-femoral and patella-femoral joints were 
analyzed separately. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test, Pearson chi-square test with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPPS</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.0</rs> software. 
Results: Group A and B were homogeneous for sex and age. At final follow up seven patients were lost. 
Subjectively Lysholm score, IKDC and Tegner Activity score improved significantly in both groups with no significant 
difference. Objectively the number of patient categorized as A and B according to the IKDC was significantly higher 
in group B than in group A ( P=0.05). Considering as a failure a S/S M/M difference &gt; 5mm or a Pivot Shift test 
graded as ++ or +++ or a recurrence of any giving way episode, we found 7 cases in group A and no cases in group 
B (P=0.006). Radiogical evaluation showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in all 
scales in both femoro-tibial and patello-femoral joints. 
Conclusion: The main limitation of the study is that the two groups were not homogeneous in term of preoperative 
conditions. However as highest grades of activity level and Pivot Shift correlate with an increased risk of DOA, this 
limitation appears to strengthen the value of the study. Adding a lateral tenodesis to an ACL IR with hamstrings, 
followed by a standard rehabilitative protocol, seems not to increase the risk of development of DOA, improving 
rotatory knee stability and reducing risk of recurrence. The meeting in Snowmass has been a milestone event in 
the evaluation of role of ERs in ACL deficent knee, giving an outstanding contribution to their definition, their 
biomechanical effect and their role in rotatory instability. However, on the basis of the results of this study, we could 
speculate that the conclusions of the meeting were somewhat misleading or at least misinterpreted, as they were 
based on surgical techniques and rehabilitation procedures no more in use in the modern ACL surgery. </p>

<p>During the last decade, the research group of the second author has developed 
a Java program for record linkage called <rs id="software-6" type="software">Merge Toolbox</rs> (MTB, <rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Schnell</rs> et al., 
2004). GRLC has extended the capabilities of the program by including routines 
for privacy preserving record linkage (Schnell et al., 2009), special routines 
for self-generated-identification codes (<rs corresp="#software-7" type="creator">Schnell</rs> et al., 2010) and updated the 
input/output-options so that <rs id="software-7" type="software">MTB</rs> is able to read and write CSV files and native 
binary Stata-15 files. <rs type="software">MTB</rs> consists of different modules such as a data editor for 
record linkage and the main linkage module. Since 2012, <rs type="software">MTB</rs> has been down-
loaded by 1104 researchers. <rs type="software">MTB</rs> is discussed in the leading textbook on record 
linkage by Christen (2012). An implementation of multibit-trees for privacy pre-
serving record linkage based on Bloomfilters (Schnell, 2015) is provided as a C++ 
stand-alone program and as a library for R. 
Due to the research on privacy preserving record linkage within the GRLC, 
many new functions for encrypting linkage keys have been developed (Schnell 
and Borgs, 2016). These new functions have not been implemented in <rs type="software">MTB</rs>, but 
in a new R library <rs type="software">PPRL</rs>. Since record linkage often involves large datasets with 
millions of records, most functions within <rs type="software">PPRL</rs> have been been optimized for 
speed using C++ as the main language. The <rs type="software">PPRL</rs> library will be released within 
2017 as an open-source project. </p>

<p>More causative gene identifications lie ahead of us 
With the introduction of higher resolution arrays in 
routine diagnostics, we can expect an increasing number 
of very local chromosomal rearrangements to be identi-
fied. These small copy number variants detected in 
patients are submitted to databases, such as DECIPHER, 
ECARUCA and ISCA, along with phenotypic information 
[38-44]. A closer look at the data submitted, for instance to 
DECIPHER, suggests that many more causative gene identi-
fications may lie ahead of us. In this database, currently 
containing publicly available data from 6,000 patients, 
about 80 de novo single gene aberrations are present, 
consisting of 55 deletions and 25 duplications. Using the 
<rs type="software">DAVID</rs> annotation tools [45], we found that 55% of these 
genes are expressed in the brain and 15% are involved in 
the functioning of the glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA)-receptors (unpublished observations). Further-
more, genes involved in neurogenesis, differentiation and 
coding for developmental proteins are enriched in this set. 
These data clearly suggest a role for at least some of these 
small copy number variants in neurological disease. </p>

<p>The proposal for the study was presented before the Re-
view Committee of Hamdard University and received ap-
proval. 
A pretest, posttest experimental group design was used 
in the study. After selection, subjects were randomly allo-
cated to one of the two groups with 15 subjects in each: 
Group A: the experimental group received deep cervical 
flexor muscles training with pressure biofeedback and con-
ventional exercises. Group B: the control group received 
deep cervical flexor muscles training with only conven-
tional exercises. 
The independent variable in the study was DCF mus-
cles training and the dependent variables were pain (P) on 
NPRS, and functional disability (D) on NDI. 
We used a pressure stabilizer, Pressure Biofeedback Unit 
(Stabilizer TM, Chattanooga Group, INC., Chattanooga, 
TN), a height adjustable bed, markers and papers. 
A letter was sent to the principals of CBSE affiliated 
schools with details of the research and their consent was 
obtained. The study was conducted on school premises in 
the medical room. The teachers were selected based on in-
clusion and exclusion criteria. Then, their informed consent 
was sought. Selected subjects were randomly allocated to 
the two groups. Subjects were informed about nature and 
procedure of study and all their questions were answered. 
Baseline information of the dependent variables was tak-
en at the beginning of study, on day 1 (P0, D0), before com-
mencement of the training protocol. Data were collected at 
the end of 2 weeks of training (P14, D14) and at the end of 4 
weeks (P28, D38). NPRS and NDI were used to evaluate the 
level of pain and functional disability, respectively. 
Both experimental and control groups performed con-
ventional exercises. In addition the experimental group 
also performed deep cervical flexor muscles training using 
pressure biofeedback. The exercise session was conducted 
under the supervision of the examiner. Subjects were asked 
not to receive any other specific intervention for neck pain. 
Training was done for 4 weeks, 4 days a week with 2 min-
utes rest between sets. Exercise duration did not exceed 20 
minutes per day. The CCFT exercise program included 3 
sets in a session 10 repetitions per set. 
The data was analyzed using <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> software. The inde-
pendent t test was used to compare age and baseline values 
of pain and disability between groups. The paired t test was 
used to compare pain on NPRS and Disability on NDI with-
in groups. All dependent variables were compared between 
baseline, their values at 2 weeks and their values at end of 4 
weeks. The independent t test was used to compare pain on 
NPRS and disability on NDI between the groups. The val-
ues of both groups, group A and group B, were compared at 
baseline and for the difference from baseline, at the end of 
2 weeks and at the end of 4 weeks. We used 95% CI and the 
results were accepted as significant if p&lt; 0.05. </p>

<p>Genomic DNAs from the different experimental groups of

Purified DNA was treated with bisulfite to convert cytosine 
to uracil using the EpiTect kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification 
of the human OCT4 and NANOG promoter regions was under-
taken using published primers (54). The PCR products were 
gel purified, cloned into TOPO TA vectors (Invitrogen) and 
sequenced using the forward and reverse M13 primers (Biopo-

transcription PCRs (qRT-PCRs) were performed using 20 ng of 
cDNA and 300 nM of each primer in a 20 ll reaction volume with 
SYBR GREEN PCR MasterMix (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, 
Canada). Three biological and three technical replicates for each 
reaction were analysed on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence 
Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with a first step of 95°C 
for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 
1 min. Melting curves were generated using the following program: 
95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 95°C for 15 s. Transcript 
abundance was quantified using standard curves for both target 
and reference genes, which were generated from serial dilutions of 
PCR products from corresponding cDNAs. Transcript abundance 
was normalized to the reference genes [PsAct (EF585293) and 
AtAct (NM_121018)] that show high stability across the different 
treatments. </p>

One microgram of total RNA was initially denatured by heating to 70°C for 
5 min. Thirty units of avian myeloblastososis virus, 200 ng of random primers, 
20 units of ribonuclease inhibitor, and 40 nmol of deoxy-nucleoside triphos-
phates with 5ϫ reaction buffer were added to the RNA, and the reverse 
transcriptase reaction was carried out at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was 
terminated by heating the cDNA to 95°C for 5 min. 
Real-time PCR. mRNA levels of genes of interest were determined using an 
ABI 7500 sequence detection system (Perkin-Elmer and Applied Biosystems, 
Warrington, U.K.). Reactions were performed in 25-l volumes on 96-well 
plates in reaction buffer containing 2ϫ TaqMan Universal PCR Master mix 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Probes and primers for all genes were 
supplied by assay on demand (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were 
normalized against the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA, provided as a preopti-
mized control probe. 
Data were measured as the cycle number at which logarithmic PCR plots 
cross a calculated threshold line (CT) and used to determine ⌬CT values 
[(⌬CT of the target gene) Ϫ (⌬CT of the housekeeping gene). Data were 
expressed as arbitrary units (AU) using the following transformation: expres-
sion ϭ 10

Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means Ϯ SE unless otherwise 
stated. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed using the 
trapezoidal method. For comparison of single variables, t tests have been used 
(or nonparametric equivalents where data were not normally distributed). 
Regression analyses were performed using Pearson correlations; where more 
than one variable was considered, multiple linear regression analysis was 
used. All analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SigmaStat</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Systat Software</rs>, Point

<p>For the total protein extract preparation, tissue samples or cell pel-
lets were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (H-buffer) containing 
20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose, 
5 mM dithiothreitol, leupeptin at 200 mg/ml, Aprotinin at 10 mg/ml, 
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (all from 
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), as previously described 
(Zappelli et al., 1996). The obtained homogenate was disrupted by 
sonication, incubated for 30 min on ice with repeated vortexing, 
and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was dis-
carded, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. For 
the preparation of subcellular protein fractions, the cell pellet was 
homogenized in H-buffer lacking Triton X-100, and incubated 
30 min on ice. Samples were then spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 
4°C. The supernatant was saved as cytosolic fraction, and the re-
maining pellet was suspended in H-buffer containing 0.1% Triton 
X-100, and incubated for 30 min on ice. At the end, the samples 
were spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the remaining su-
pernatant was saved as the particulate fraction. An equal amount of 
protein from each sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylam-
ide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &amp; 
Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were then incubated 
with the appropriate primary antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Roche Applied Science) or 
ALP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories, South 
San Francisco, CA) were used as secondary antibodies, and immu-
noreactive bands were detected using CDP-STAR solution (Roche 
Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
Densitometric analysis was performed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Aida</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">2.1</rs> Image soft-
ware (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Raytest</rs>, Straubenhardt, Germany). 
For immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was incubated with the anti-
FAK antibody (1 μg/100 μl of lysate) overnight at 4°C. At the end of 
incubation, 20 μl of protein-A agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 
was added and incubated for an additional 3 h at 4°C. The immuno-
precipitate was then collected by centrifugation and washed three 
times with H-buffer, and the final pellet was used for Western blot 
analysis. </p>

<p>Muscle cryosections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) on ice, and cultured cells were fixed in etha-
nol/acetone (1:1 [vol/vol] ratio) at -20°C for 20 min. For histological 
analysis, muscle cryosections were stained with hematoxylin and eo-
sin (H&amp;E) solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and cultured cells with Wright's 
solution (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI). The muscle fiber mean CSA was 
determined by measuring the CSA of all fibers in the entire section,

fluorescence analysis of cells, cryosections, or isolated myofibers 
was performed as previously described (Castaldi et al., 2007; Aulino 
et al., 2010). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Fluka) 
or with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen), and the samples were analyzed un-
der an epifluorescence Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope (Carl Zeiss, 
Oberkochen, Germany) or a Leica Leitz DMRB microscope fitted 
with a DFC300FX camera (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). </p>

<p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 
normal ovary tissue and serous tumors were cut into 
4-6-μm sections and transferred to slides. Samples were 
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated via an ethanol 
gradient (100%, 95% ×2, 85%, 75% ×2, 50%, and distilled 
water). Slides were then washed, endogenous peroxidase 
activity was blocked by incubation in 3% H 2 O 2 , and samples 
were preincubated with 10% goat serum, and then with 
monoclonal mouse anti-PDCD5 antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at 
room temperature in a humid chamber. Secondary staining 
with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zhongshan Golden 
Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) was performed 
using a DAB peroxidase substrate kit (Zhongshan Golden 
Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China). Nuclei were 
counterstained with hematoxylin. In negative controls, the 
primary antibody was replaced with an isotype control. All 
staining was evaluated using the <rs type="software">Leica Q550CW</rs> software 
system (Germany) and <rs type="software">Qwin</rs> image analysis software. We 
randomly selected five independent fields from each slide; 
the average density of positive cells these five fields was 
calculated as the PDCD5 expression level. </p>

<p>SKOV3 cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 1× binding 
buffer at a density of 4.0 × 10 
5 cells/ml and transferred to a 
12-well dish (1 ml suspension/well). Cells were incubated 
in triplicate with PBS (control), 20 μg/ml recombinant 
human PDCD5 (rhPDCD5; P20; Beijing University 
Human Disease Center, Beijing, China), 0.1 μg/ml 
taxol (T0.1), 0.5 μg/ml doxorubicin (A0.5), or P20 plus 
T0.1 or A0.5. After 24 h, cells were collected, centrifuged, 
and incubated with conjugated Annexin V (2.5 μl; 
Pharmingen) and 1 μl propidium iodide (Pharmingen) for 
15 min at room temperature in the dark. Next, 400 μl ×1 
Annexin binding buffer was added to each cell sample, 
and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD 
Influx, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Becton Dickinson</rs>) using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Cell Quest Research 
Software</rs> (Becton Dickinson). </p>

<p>We used χ 
2 and Fisher's exact tests to determine 
correlations between PDCD5 levels and clinical parameters. 
The cumulative survival time was calculated by the 
Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test. 
Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate 
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
between groups in univariate and multivariate settings. 
A P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. All calculations 
were performed using <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">17.0</rs> statistical software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., USA). </p>

<p>Rank sum and F tests were used for the comparison of 
ps-Tg and ps-Tg/TSH values. The Kruskal-Wallis and 
F tests were used for comparisons among the three groups; 
the Mann-Whitney U and F tests were used to compare any 
two groups. The most sensitive and specific ps-Tg values 
for distinguishing each of the two group comparisons were 
obtained using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. 
Gender (female or male), age (&lt;45 years or ≥45 years), tumor 
size (maximum diameter ≤1 cm or &gt;1 cm), multifocality 
(single lesion or multiple lesions) and ps-Tg level 
(&lt;corresponding cut-off value or ≥corresponding cut-off 
value) were involved as independent variables of recurrence 
and distant metastasis. These factors were further analyzed 
using logistic regression analysis to identify if ps-Tg was 
an independent predictive factor for discerning different 
recurrence risk groups, and if distant metastases existed. 
A P &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All 
of these statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> 
software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 17.0</rs>, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">R

<p>All statistical calculations were conducted with a statistical soft-
ware program (<rs type="software">SAS</rs>) 
a and a statistical significance level of 5% was 
used. 
Logistic regression analysis taking clustering caused by multiple 
measurements per clinical observer into account was performed 
using proc genmod in the <rs type="software">SAS</rs> system. Dogs examined in the years 
of 2002, 2003, 2010, and 2011 were divided into 3 groups. Group 
1 was defined as all dogs examined in 2002 and 2003. Dogs in 
group 2 were examined in 2010 and 2011, and in addition, were a 
product of the breeding scheme (PB). Group 3 consisted of dogs 
also examined in 2010 and 2011 but not a product of the breeding 
scheme (non-PB). Products of the breeding scheme were defined as 
dogs with both parents approved by the DKCA breeding scheme. 
Only the most recent examination was included in the statistical 
analyses if a dog had repeated examinations within the time per-
iod. The presence of mitral regurgitation murmur (yes/no) or 
degree of MVP &gt; 1 (yes/no) were included as response variables 
and age at examination, group (1, 2 or 3) and sex (male or female) 
were included as explanatory variables. Backward stepwise elimi-
nation was performed until only explanatory variables showing 
significance were left in the model. If an overall significance of </p>

<p>Three consecutive 24-hour food recalls (2 weekdays and 1 
weekend day) were obtained from each subject by trained 
interviewers using food models. Retinol intakes were estimated 
using a <rs id="software-2" type="software">CAN-pro</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">3.0</rs> nutritional analysis program developed by 
<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">the Korean Nutrition Society</rs> [18]. Carotenoid intakes (α-carotene, 
β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene) 
were measured by the values of the book, "Phytonutrient Contents 
in Vegetable/Fruits/Legumes," reporting carotenoid contents in 
plant foods [19], the values of carotenoids in some Korean foods 
[20,21], and the carotenoid values in the United States Department 
of Agriculture Food database [22]. Dietary vitamin A intakes </p>

<p>Data were analyzed by age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 
50-59 years) using <rs id="software-3" type="software">SAS</rs> version 9.1.3 software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">SAS Institute, Inc.</rs>., Cary, NC, USA). The differences among age groups were 
analyzed using one-way ANOVA with the Least Significant 
Difference post-hoc test [23]. Pearson's correlation coefficients 
were calculated to determine correlations between intakes and 
plasma concentrations of retinol and carotenoids. Differences 
were considered significant at P &lt; 0.05. Values are reported as 
means ± standard deviations. </p>

<p>data were analyzed by <rs type="software">FlowJo</rs> software (FlowJo). </p>

<p>Variables that were predictors of AMI or MACE on univariate 
analysis by logistic regression ( p&lt;0.05) and variables with satis-
factory interobserver reliability (κ&gt;0.6) were considered for 
inclusion in the final model. A summary of the univariate ana-
lyses is reported in the online supplementary appendix and add-
itional data are published elsewhere. 
5 9 To limit the potential 
for overfitting, only biomarkers with an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of &gt;0.75 were considered for 
inclusion in the final model. 
Potential predictor variables were then entered into a multi-
variate analysis by forward stepwise logistic regression (p&lt;0.05 
for entry, p&gt;0.10 for removal, using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.20.0</rs>; SPSS, 
Chicago, Illinois, USA). Biomarker levels were entered as con-
tinuous variables to avoid the loss of potentially valuable diag-
nostic information at levels below and above dichotomous 
cut-offs. Hs-cTnT levels below the limit of blank for the assay 
(&lt;3 ng/L) were entered as 2 ng/L. We then used the predicted 
probability of developing the primary outcome (according to 
the final model) to categorise patients into four risk groups, 
which were defined a priori according to the disposition deci-
sions available to emergency physicians for this patient group: 
(1) Very low risk (suitable for discharge); (2) Low risk (suitable 
for a low dependency environment such as an ED observation 
unit); (3) Moderate risk (general or acute medical ward); and 
(4) High-risk ( patients who may be considered for immediate 
referral to a high dependency environment, eg, a coronary care 
unit). Diagnostic accuracy of the CDR was evaluated in deriv-
ation and validation studies by calculation of the areas under 
the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV and NPV together with 95% CIs (using 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">MedCalc</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">V.12.4.0.0</rs>, Mariakerke, Belgium). Baseline character-

using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">V.20.0</rs>. 
After completion of the validation study, we noted that 
tobacco smoking had been excluded from the initial multivariate 
analysis in error. We therefore repeated the multivariate analysis 
with tobacco smoking included. The resultant alternative deci-
sion rule and its performance are presented in the online sup-
plementary appendix. </p>

results were expressed by the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 16</rs>) in 
percentage. </p>

<p>The analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v.20</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs>), <rs id="software-1" type="software">SAS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">v.9.3</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>.) and R 
(v.2.11, R Foundation). The extent of the WMH pen-
umbra was determined by identifying the plateau phase 
of each dataset by comparing each CBF, FLAIR inten-
sity, and DTI layer to its corresponding mean 
total brain value within NAWM using a mixed effects 
model. We created 15 dummy variables indicating each 
NAWM layer with total brain NAWM as a reference. 
The difference in coefficients between two adjacent 
layers were compared to examine the plateau phase. 
There is a ''location effect'' of white matter association 
and commissural fibers surrounding the ventricles 
resulting in high DTI-FA in NAWM surrounding 
PVWMH compared with the mean NAWM DTI-FA 
of the entire brain. 
24 Because of this anatomical 
phenomenon, the plateau phase of this data was deter-
mined by comparing adjacent data points using paired 
t-tests. The first of two neighboring layers whose values 
were not significantly different from each other was 
defined as the outer boundary for the PVWMH 
DTI-FA penumbra. Significant difference was set at 
p &lt; 0.05. The analysis was performed for PVWMH 
and DWMHs separately. </p>

<p>Data were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) for 
quantitative variables. Qualitative data are represented as relative 
percentages. The Student t test and chi-square test were used for 
comparison of clinical and radiological data. Multivariate 
regression was used to analyze the clinical outcome effects of 
any independent variables. Multivariate regression was adjusted 
for age, gender, spinal cord compressing rate, mean duration 
of symptoms, pre-and postoperative sagittal diameter, pre-and 
postoperative modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score 
(mJOA), pre-and postoperative PCS, pre-and postoperative 
MCS, and surgical method (HPLL removing = 1; HPLL retaining 
= 0). 
[17] A P-value less than 0.05 (P &lt; .05) was considered 
statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using

<p>The obtained viral genomic DNA was amplified using a 
GenomePhi kit (GE Healthcare) and used to make 
barcoded (10 bp) fragment libraries for 454 sequencing 
on a Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium (Roche/454 Life 
Science). The reads were assembled using the <rs id="software-15" type="software">gsAssembler</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-15" type="creator">Roche/454 Life Science</rs>). The coverage of the different 
genomes was 17Â for HRPV-2, 14Â for HRPV-3, 300Â 
for HRPV-6 and 300Â for HGPV-1. The obtained 
assembly was verified with PCR products that for 
HRPV-2, HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 covered the whole 
genome. The final genome sequences were obtained by 
sequencing these PCR products. For HRPV-6, several 
Sanger sequencing runs confirmed the initial assembly. 
The primers used for PCR and sequencing are listed in 
Supplementary Table S2. For the verification of the 
discontinuous regions, genomic DNA was used in 
sequencing reactions with primers, which are also listed 
in Supplementary Table S2. All sequencing reactions 
were carried out by using BigDye Termination 
Chemistry v. 3.1 and analysed on an ABI 3130 (Applied 
Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with 
CleanSeq (Agencourt) using a Beckman NX 
p robot 
(Beckman Coulter). Sequences were assembled and 
edited using GAP4. The sequences were submitted to 
GenBank and can be found under the accession 
numbers JN882264 (HRPV-2), JN882265 (HRPV-3), 
JN882266 (HRPV-6) and JN882267 (HGPV-1). 
The genome sequences were annotated using 
<rs id="software-17" type="software">DNAMaster</rs>

<rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-number">version5.22.2</rs>), <rs type="software">pDRAW32</rs> and <rs id="software-19" type="software">GeneMark.hmm for Prokaryotes</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-19" type="version-number">version 2.8</rs>). Homologous nucleotide and protein se-
quences were searched for using BLASTN and BLASTP 
tools, respectively, (28) available at the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Manually refined 
annotations were based on <rs type="software">GeneMark.hmm</rs> coding poten-
tial analysis, the obtained protein chemistry data and 
colinearity with previously annotated pleomorphic virus 
genomes (6,20). The properties of identified proteins and 
the products of putative ORFs were analysed using expert 
protein analysis system (EXPASY) proteomics tools. 
Isoelectric points and molecular masses were determined 
using <rs type="software">Compute pI/MW</rs> tool (29). The signal sequences for 
VP4-like proteins were predicted using <rs id="software-25" type="software">Signal P</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-25" type="version-number">version3.0</rs>) (30) and <rs type="software">TatFind Servers</rs> (31). Conserved protein sig-
nature sequences were determined using <rs type="software">InterProScan</rs> 
(32). Putative trans-membrane regions of proteins were 
additionally determined using combined predictions by 
<rs type="software">TMHMM</rs> tool (33) and <rs type="software">TMPred</rs> tool (34). Coiled-coil 
regions were predicted using Coil tool (35). Multiple 
sequence alignments were generated using <rs type="software">T-Coffee</rs> (36), 
<rs type="software">Muscle</rs> (37) and <rs type="software">Praline</rs> (38). Conserved DNA motifs in 
aligned nucleotide sequences (<rs type="software">T-Coffee</rs>) were visualized 
with <rs type="software">WebLogo</rs> (39). </p>

ences of identified or putative proteins were determined 
using <rs id="software-36" type="software">EMBOSS Needle tool</rs> at <rs corresp="#software-36" type="creator">EMBL-EBI</rs>. Protein 
sequences were aligned with <rs type="software">T-Coffee</rs> program, and 
conserved blocks for the phylogenetic analysis were 
selected using <rs type="software">Gblocks</rs> (40). The phylogeny was recon-
structed by maximum likelihood method using <rs type="software">phyml</rs> 
algorithm (41). Resulting trees were visualized in 
<rs id="software-40" type="software">Phylodendron</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-40" type="url">http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/molbio/java/apps/trees</rs>/). </p>

<p>The first protein encoded by a conserved cluster of genes is 
VP3-like protein (Figure 1). It is a major structural protein 
of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses, predicted to contain 
several transmembrane regions. VP3-like proteins of the 
first subgroup of viruses and putative proviruses share 
extensive identity at the amino acid level ($50% and 
above, Supplementary Figure S3). In contrast, VP3-like 
proteins of the second subgroup show only $20% 
identity to each other and to homologues of the first 
subgroup members. 
The next protein encoded in the conserved cluster of 
genes is VP4-like major structural protein (Figure 1), 
forming the spike structure on the virion surface. This 
protein is processed during maturation. In order to 
predict the translation start site, the empirically deter-
mined N-termini (Table 1) together with <rs type="software">Signal P</rs> and 
<rs type="software">Tat find</rs> programs were used. Three of the manually 
annotated VP4-like protein precursors were predicted to 
have a twin-arginine signal sequence suggesting export of 
the protein in a folded state. Most of the VP4-like protein 
precursors share only $20% identity (Supplementary 
Table S8). Even though VP4-like polypeptides are much 
more diverse than VP3-like proteins, the secondary struc-
tures are predicted to be similar. All of them are also pre-
dicted to contain a coiled-coil region in the C-terminus of 
the protein just preceding the transmembrane domain that 
serves as a membrane anchor. 
The following members of the conserved cluster are 
ORF6-like and ORF7-like putative genes (Figure 1), 
encoding products of unknown function. Both of the 
putative proteins are predicted to have transmembrane 
domains. Putative ORF6-like gene products show rather 
low conservation among haloarchaeal viruses and proviral </p>

however, significantly from 0.109±0.115 to 0.121±0.120 (p=0.006). 
The slope was obtained rom the logarithmic equation between RR-1 
and adjusted E' . Patients with very rapid or slow ventricular rates 
(most RR intervals &lt;0.6 or &gt;1.0 second, n=21) were excluded and 
the logarithmic equation between RR-1 and adjusted E' was recal-
culated in co-ordination with RR-1 ranging from 0.6 to 1 second

<p>Medium techniques. Basal, bicarbonate-buffered medium (pH 6.8 to 7.0) 
was utilized for MPN and isolate characterization studies. Media were 
prepared anaerobically under 80:20 N 2 -CO 2 headspace as previously de-
scribed (43). Where noted, quinone-or hydroquinone-containing media 
were prepared by adding AQDS at concentrations of 5 mM total an-
thraquinone. To prepare AH 2 DS, AQDS solutions were degassed and 
then bubbled with 80:20 H 2 -CO 2 in the presence of palladium-coated 
aluminum chips (21, 44). When a red color developed, the medium was 
bubbled for 20 min with 80:20 N 2 -CO 2 to remove dissolved H 2 and sub-
sequently decanted away from the palladium into pressure tubes or serum 
bottles before autoclaving. Acetate (0.1 mM) and nitrate (10.0 mM) were 
added as sodium salts from anoxic sterile stock solutions. 
The medium for column experiments was comprised of 10 mM phos-
phate buffer (pH 7.2) amended with 5 ml liter Ϫ1 trace mineral solution 
(45). The medium was boiled and cooled under N 2 gas and then sealed 
and autoclaved in 2-liter bottles. Electron acceptor medium contained 
nitrate (1.0 or 0.5 mM) added from stock solutions. Different electron 
donor media (donor-free, oxidized HA, and reduced HA media) were 
prepared for each column treatment. Donor-free medium consisted of 
phosphate-buffered water and mineral solution only. Oxidized HA treat-
ments were prepared by adding 0.5 g liter Ϫ1 of Aldrich HA to previously 
degassed and cooled media prior to autoclaving. Reduced HA treatments 
were prepared by adding 0.5 g liter Ϫ1 of the same HA stock to degassed 
medium, chemically reducing the HA as previously described (44), and 
bubbling the medium for 20 minutes with N 2 to remove H 2 prior to 
autoclaving. Each donor bottle was supplemented with 200 M bromide 
tracer from stock aqueous solutions of sodium salts. 
Analytical techniques. Anions were quantified by ion chromatogra-
phy on a Dionex DX500 employing a CD20 conductivity detector sup-
pressed with an ASRS-ULTRA II 4-mm system. Nitrate and nitrite con-
centrations were resolved on an IonPac AS9-HC anion-exchange column, 
with a 9 mM Na 2 CO 3 mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min Ϫ1 . AH 2 DS 
and reduced humic acid concentrations were analyzed by ferric citrate 
back-titration or spectrophotometrically as previously described (21, 39, 
40). Total anthraquinone concentrations were determined by aerating 
filtered samples and quantifying AQDS as previously described (29). 
Fe(II) was quantified with a ferrozine assay as previously described (46). 
MPN analysis and isolation/characterization of pure cultures. A 
family farm in the Platte River valley near Linwood, NE, was chosen as a 
sampling site. Soils were collected from the top 12 inches of plots contain-
ing corn or soy (either amended or unamended with swine manure in the 
previous growing season), as well as from native bluegrass grasslands and 
wooded areas containing ash, elm, oak, and cedar trees adjacent to the 
cultivated areas. The samples were sealed in autoclaved mason jars, 
brought to the laboratory, and subjected to most probable number 
(MPN) analysis for nitrate-reducing, AH 2 DS-oxidizing microorganisms 
as previously described, with an 87-day incubation period (21). Nitrate 
reduction and nitrite production in MPN tubes was measured via anion 
analysis of 0.2-m-filtered subsamples from the 10 Ϫ3 dilution series. Pure 
cultures of AH 2 DS-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing cells were obtained utiliz-
ing an agar shaking tube method previously described (21). Selected iso-
lates were characterized for AH 2 DS-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing capabili-
ties in the presence of 100 M acetate as a suitable carbon source. 
Phylogenetic analysis of isolates. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was ex-
tracted from isolate growth cultures oxidizing AH 2 DS with a MoBio 
Power Soil DNA kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Solana Beach, CA) per the 
manufacturer's protocol. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from gDNA 
extracts with universal primers 27F (5=-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) 
and 1492R (5=-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT) (F stands for forward and 
R stands for reverse in the primer names). 16S rRNA gene amplification 
was performed with Takara Ex Taq HS according to the manufacturer's 
protocol. Isolation of genomic DNA, 16S rRNA gene-specific PCR, and 
sequencing of PCR products were conducted as described previously (27, 
31). 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned with <rs id="software-5" type="software">MUSCLE</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">3.6</rs> (47), and </p>

<p>Bayesian analysis of 16S rRNA gene phylogeny was completed with 
<rs id="software-4" type="software">MrBayes</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">3.2</rs> (48, 49). The program was run with four chains until the 
standard deviation of the split frequencies was stabilized below 0.01, in 
this case for 450,000 generations, with a sample frequency of 1,000. The 
first 25% of the samples were discarded for accurate estimation of the 
posterior probability distribution of the summary tree. 
Humic column experiments. Up-flow glass column reactors were 
constructed as diagrammed in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. The 
columns were filled with a matrix containing 1 N HCl-washed, autoclaved 
3-mm-diameter glass beads (Walter Stern no. 100C) inoculated 10% (wt/ 
wt) by manual mixing with corn plot soil (~750 ml total matrix volume/ 
column). The columns were sparged with He, sealed with rubber stop-
pers, and covered with aluminum foil. The columns were incubated for 
2 days with approximately 370 ml of medium containing 500 M nitrate 
to allow for microbial adherence and then equilibrated for flow rate and 
nitrate breakthrough over 7 days by continually injecting port A with 
electron acceptor medium (1.0 mM nitrate) and port B with donor-free 
medium (average total flow rate of 3.1 Ϯ 0.2 ml/h). After 7 days, the 
nitrate concentrations in continually injected acceptor medium were re-
duced to 0.5 mM, and donor treatments commenced through continual 
injection of donor medium at port B. Donor treatments were as follows: 
donor-free medium, 0.5 g/liter oxidized Aldrich HA medium, and 0.5 g/ 
liter reduced Aldrich HA medium. Column performance was assessed by 
frequent retention time and total medium flowthrough measurements. 
Nitrate, nitrite, bromide, and reduced HA content were analyzed at time 
points along the length of each column at ports 1, 2, 3, and 4. Reduced HA 
content was defined as the difference between Fe(II) generated in back-
titration reactions and Fe(II) present in the native initial sample prior to 
Fe(III) citrate addition and was calculated as follows: reduced HA ϭ 
Fe(II) back-titration -Fe(II) initial . 
PhyloChip. To characterize changes in the bacterial community after 
humic acid treatment, DNA was extracted from the initial inoculum and 
from port 1 of each of three columns (no donor, oxidized HA, and re-
duced HA). Due to the high humic content of the soil, the previously 
described extraction protocol (31) was modified to increase DNA quality 
and yields. Specifically, 50 l of 0.1 M aluminum ammonium sulfate was 
added as flocculent to the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) 
extraction buffer to minimize coextraction of humic acid material, and 
nucleic acids were precipitated for two hours at room temperature with 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) rather than isopropanol (31). Extractions three 
times for each soil sample with pellets from each sample combined and 
resuspended in 100 l of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Coextraction of humic 
material in samples from the HA-treated columns resulted in brown re-
suspended DNA that failed to amplify by PCR. To remove humic sub-
stance contamination from the DNA, all the resuspended DNA samples 
were purified using the MoBio Power Soil DNA kit according to the man-
ufacturer's protocol apart from the fact that the samples were gently 
mixed rather than beadbeated or vortexed. DNA quality and quantifica-
tion were assessed by gel visualization. PCR amplification was conducted 
as previously described (Wrighton et al. [31]); the amplifications over a 
gradient using 8 different annealing temperatures and nondegenerate 
primers and were restricted to 25 cycles to minimize PCR bias. The 
amount of PCR product loaded onto the chips, target fragmentation, 
biotin labeling, PhyloChip hybridization, scanning, and staining, as well 
as background subtraction, noise calculation, and detection and quanti-
fication criteria were based on the protocol given in reference 30. 
PhyloChip arrays from the initial inoculum, no-donor control col-
umn, oxidized humic substance column, and reduced humic substance 
column. For bacterial richness, a taxon was considered present in the 
sample when 90% or more of its assigned probe pairs for its correspond-
ing probe set were positive (positive fraction of Ն0.90). To determine the 
differences in bacterial community composition, nonmetric multidimen-
sional scaling (NMDS) was performed on PhyloChip hybridization data 
using the statistical package <rs id="software-6" type="software">Primer V</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">Plymouth Marine Laboratory</rs>, 
Plymouth, United Kingdom). To discriminate the bacterial populations </p>

<p>enriched in the humic acid-treated columns, a subtractive analysis be-
tween the controls and humic acid-treated columns was performed. 
With the intention of illustrating the phylogenetic response to HA 
across the 5 most enriched phyla, a maximum likelihood tree was con-
structed using the 365 16S rRNA sequences from the five dominant phyla 
demonstrated to be enriched relative to the control in either or both col-
umns treated with humic acid. The sequences were aligned with <rs id="software-7" type="software">MUSCLE</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">3.6</rs> (Edgar), and phylogenetic analysis was performed with RAxML (Sta-
matakis). 16S rRNA sequences of previously isolated humic substance-
oxidizing and -reducing bacteria and the bacteria characterized as part of 
this study (numbered isolates 8 to 14, 23, 24, and 26) are also included in 
the phylogenetic analyses and resulting tree. Isolate sequences are num-
bered as follows (accession numbers are given in the parentheses; all ac-
cession numbers are for the GenBank databank, except for accession

ported humic substance response. A phylogenetic response is defined 
when Ͼ85% of the OTUs in a group respond uniformly to HA treatment. 
Taxon level responses are denoted with shading with colors similar to 
those used for the OTU designations. </p>

<p>4.1 The Optimal Policy Problem 
The optimal policy under commitment can be computed by formulat-
ing an infinite-horizon Lagrangian problem in which the central bank 
maximizes conditional expected social welfare subject to the full set of 
nonlinear constraints implied by the private sector's behavioral equa-
tions and the market-clearing conditions of the model economy.33 The 
first-order conditions of this problem are obtained by differentiating 
the Lagrangian with respect to each of the endogenous variables (in-
cluding the policy instrument) and setting these derivatives to 0. Of 
course, performing these derivations by hand would be extremely 
tedious; thus, we utilize the symbolic <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> procedures developed by 
Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004).34 
We then proceed to analyze the behavior of the economy under 
optimal policy by combining the central bank's first-order conditions 
together with the private sector's behavioral equations and the market-</p>

<p>multipliers is added to the list of model variables. Nevertheless, it 
should be emphasized that no new parameters have been added to the 
model because the central bank's first-order conditions involve the 
same structural parameters as in the behavioral equations and market-
clearing conditions. 
Because this set of nonlinear equations involves rational expecta-
tions, numerical methods are required to characterize the equilib-
rium properties of the stochastic economy.35 Furthermore, while the 
first-order dynamics can be investigated by log-linearizing the model, 
higher-order methods are needed to evaluate conditional expected 
welfare.36 Therefore, we employ the Dynare software package of Juil-
lard (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-date">2001</rs>) to compute the second-order approximation of the model 
economy.37 
Finally, as in Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004), our analysis is focused 
on evaluating the welfare cost of business cycles; that is, for each mone-
tary policy regime, we measure how conditional expected welfare 
changes in response to the stochastic variation of the model econ-
omy.38 Throughout the paper, welfare costs are expressed in terms of 
the equivalent percentage decline in steady-state consumption. </p>

<p>P spectra were post-processed using an automated 
procedure developed in <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAGE</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GE Medical Systems</rs>, Fremont,

spectrum, following 2D CSI reconstruction with a magnitude 
channel. After using the 6 Hz exponential line broadening, 
we obtained the MR spectra that were assigned on the basis 
of prior assignment, such as PME, Pi, PDE, PCr and ATP.

<p>Statistical Analysis 
We compared the mean values of the intracellular pH and 
the metabolite ratios between the normal control group and 
the brain tumor group by using the Mann-Whitney U test. 
The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for obtaining the 
statistical significant parameter between the each brain 
lesion. Additionally, multiple comparisons of each brain 
lesions were also carried out using the Dunn test. 
For comparison between the low grade astrocytoma group 
and high grade astocytoma group, and between the brain 
tumor group and the abscess group, the mean values of 
the intracellular pH and the metabolite ratios were also 
compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test. 
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

<p>(RIFLE) criteria have been proposed as useful criteria 
for staging of patients with acute kidney injuries; this 
criteria focuses mainly on GFR. However, the current 
study has used many other factors, including GFR and 
other criteria, including a number of electrolytes, 
hemoglobin, and fluid balance. 
Inside the operating theater, demographic and 
anthropometric data including age, sex, presence of 
diabetes and blood pressure in sitting position were 
recorded. Blood pressure was measured twice after 
5 min on average. Also, body mass index was 
calculated as kg/m 2 . 
All patients underwent catheterization using 
standard Judkins or Sones techniques. Angiographic 
scoring was performed by 2 cardiologists. Coronary 
angiographies were interpreted visually and were 
always analyzed in 2 orthogonal views. Stenosis of 
&gt; 50% in any of the main epicardial vessels 
reflected a significant coronary artery disease. 
CABG was performed according to the guidelines 
of American College of Cardiology. 13 
Sample size was determined after a power 
analysis (power = 0.8, β = 0.2, α = 0.02); using the 
power analysis and sample size software: <rs id="software-0" type="software">PASS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2005</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">NCSS Statistical Software</rs>, Utah, USA). The clinical 
criterion for sample size determination was the 
observed frequency of "per hour urinary output 
needing medical intervention;" so, we required 35 
patients in each group; equals a total of 105; 
however, to compensate for possible dropouts, we 
added 20% to the calculated sample size to have a 
final sample of 126 (42 in each group).

<p>This was a cross-sectional study that collected samples 
of colostrum milk from 93 women seen at the Januário 
Cicco teaching maternity hospital in Natal, Rio Grande do 
Norte, Brazil, after prior approval by the Research Ethics 
Committee at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do 
Norte. Newborn infants were classified by gestational age 
and birth weight. Their mothers were enrolled while still in 
the maternity ward if they did not meet any of the following 
exclusion criteria: maternal complications (diabetes, hyper-
tension, cancer, liver disease, infectious diseases, gastroin-
testinal tract diseases, heart disease, syphilis, HIV infection, 
among others); fetal malformation; multiple births; vitamin 
supplementation during pregnancy or postpartum vitamin 
A "megadose" supplementation, because this comprises 
200,000UI of retinyl palmitate combined with 49.4mg of 
all-rac-α-tocopherol. 
Sample size was calculated using Statcalc (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Epi-Info</rs>, ver-
sion 3.5.3). According to public health statistics for Natal, 
the city has a 7.9% rate of premature live births </p>

USA). The concentration of the standard was confirmed 
against the specific extinction coefficient in absolute ethanol 
for α-tocopherol (ε 1%, 1cm=75.8 to 292nm) 
(22) . 
Statistical analysis was performed using the open 
source <rs id="software-0" type="software">statistical software R</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 2.15</rs>. The results for 
α-tocopherol concentrations in colostrum were expressed as 
means with standard deviations. Numerical variables were 
shown not to be normal, by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, 
characterizing the samples as parametric. 
The preterm and full term subsets were compared for the 
response variable α-tocopherol concentration in colostrum 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Tukey's post hoc 
test. This statistical treatment evaluated both the main ef-
fects of gestational age and birth weight on α-tocopherol </p>

<p>. Fragmentation in the Orbitrap was performed at 33% normal-
ized collision energy with a target value of 10,000 ions. The full target 
was set to 30,000, with 1 microscan and 100 ms injection time, and the 
dynamic exclusion was set to 0.5 min. A total of 5 MS data sets, two 
from unfractionated material and three from the corresponding MCX 
fractions, were registered with 25 h total acquisition time. For peptide 
identification the MS/MS spectra were searched with the SEQUEST HT 
algorithm implemented in <rs id="software-20" type="software">Proteome Discoverer</rs> <rs corresp="#software-20" type="version-number">1.4.0.29</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-20" type="creator">Thermo Scientific</rs>). Database searching against human protein sequences from 
the UniProt database (September 2014, 147,615 entries) was per-
formed with the following parameters: trypsin digestion with 2 
maximum missed cleavage sites; precursor and fragment mass toler-
ances of 2 Da and 0.02 Da, respectively; carbamidomethyl and 
methylthio Cys and Met oxidation as dynamic modifications; and N-
terminal and Lys iTRAQ modifications as fixed modifications. The 
results were analyzed using the probability ratio method [28] and the 
FDR (False Discovery Rate) for peptide identification was calculated 
based on the search results against a decoy database using the refined 
method [29]. </p>

<p>A second cohort of patients (n=20) was independently considered 
for orthogonal validation analyses. Mitochondria were obtained from 
mature frozen adipocytes using the Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Cat. 
ab110171, Abcam), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
Concentration of mitochondrial suspension was determined by Pierce 
BCA Protein Assay. Ten μg of protein extracts were loaded, resolved on 
SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes 
which were stained with 0.15% Ponceau red to ensure proper transfer 
and then blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 
20. The primary antibodies used for protein validation were 1:2000 
rabbit anti-SOD2 (ADI-SOD-111, Enzo Life Sciences); 1:5000 rabbit 
anti-CS (C5498, Sigma-Aldrich); 1:2000 mouse anti-COX5B (sc-
374417, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:2000 mouse anti-VDAC1 
(ab14734), 1:1000 rabbit anti-TFAM (ab47517), 1:1000 mouse anti-
NDUFA9 (ab14713), 1:1000 rabbit anti-SDHC (ab155999) and 1:1000 
mouse Total OXPHOS Human WB Antibody Cocktail (ab11041) 
including anti-UQCRC2 (ab14745), anti-MTCO2 (ab110258) and 
anti-ATP5A1 (ab14748) (Abcam). Blots were incubated with the 
appropriate IgG-HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immunor-
eactive bands were visualized with Amersham ECL Western Blotting 
Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare). Blots were exposed for different 
times. Exposures in the linear range of signal were selected for 
densitometric evaluation with <rs type="software">Image J</rs> analysis software. 
Additionally, infrared-labeled secondary antibodies were also used 
(Li-Cor Biosciences). The bands were detected using the <rs type="software">Odyssey</rs> 
Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences), and the images were 
analyzed with Odyssey Application Software. </p>

<p>Descriptive results of continuous variables are expressed as mean ± 
standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed using the 
<rs id="software-16" type="software">Statistical Package for Social Science</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-16" type="version-number">v. 22</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-16" type="creator">SPSS, Inc</rs>). One-
way ANOVA (using Bonferroni's post hoc test) was used to compare the 
anthropometrical and clinical data from the patients. The relation 
between variables was evaluated by Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. 
Unpaired Student's t-test was used for direct comparisons between two 
groups of samples. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 in all 
cases. A 1% peptide FDR threshold was considered. Peptide and 
protein abundance changes were assessed using the iTRAQ reporter 
ion intensities retrieved from MS/MS scans by <rs type="software">QuiXoT</rs> software 
[30,31] as inputs to the WSPP model [32]. This model circumvents 
the statistical issues reported for protein quantitation from iTRAQ-
labeled peptides [33] and, by decomposing the different variance 
components, takes into account variance non-homogeneity and the 
highly unbalanced structure of this kind of data [32]. The model also 
provides a robust framework for the full integration of quantitative and 
error information from a given level to a superior level (e.g. peptide to 
protein); thus, the standardized variable, Zq, is defined as the mean-
corrected log 2 ratio expressed in units of standard deviation at the 
protein level. For the quantitation of Cys oxidation, oxCys peptide 
abundance was evaluated by the corresponding standardized log 2 ratio, 
Zp, therefore avoiding biased calculations due to changes in the 
abundance of the proteins from which these peptides originated [27]. 
The threshold for differential protein and peptide abundance was set at 
|Zq|≥2 and |Zp|≥2, respectively. For the analysis of coordinated 
protein responses [34] a standardized log 2 ratio, Zc, was calculated 
for each functional protein category. Categories with at least 5 protein 
components and FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered significantly differential </p>

(<rs corresp="#software-26" type="url">https://david.ncifcrf.gov</rs>/) [35] including information from KEGG, 
PANTHER and GO_FAT annotations. Mitochondrial protein terms 
were obtained from both the GO Mitochondrion annotation 
(GO:0005739, http://www.geneontology.org/) and Human MitoCarta 
v2.0 [36]. Enrichment analyses were performed using <rs type="software">DAVID</rs> software

<p>A prediction corrected visual predictive check [13] (PC-VPC) 
was performed for the final PK model. Five hundred 
data sets were simulated using the final model parameters, 
covariates, sampling times and dosing histories. Both the 
observed and the model predicted individual concentra-
tion values were normalized by the population prediction 
of the same time point. Non-parametric bootstrap analysis 
was also performed by generating 1000 data sets through 
random sampling with replacement from the original data 
using the individual as the sampling unit. No stratification 
was implemented during the random sampling. Population 
parameters of the final model for each data set were 
estimated using <rs type="software">NONMEM</rs> and empirical 95% CIs were 
constructed. </p>

<p>Flow cytometry. Staining for intracellular cytokine expression was per-
formed using the CytoFix/CytoPerm Plus kit with GolgiStop (BD). CD4 + 
T cell cultures were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) 
at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml of culture, respectively, 
for 3 h in the presence of GolgiStop. Cells were surface stained with anti-
V8 FITC, and intracellularly with anti-IL-2 APC, anti-IL-4 PE, anti-
IL-10 APC, anti-IL-17 PE, and anti-IFN- PE antibodies, or isotype 
controls (BD). For T-bet staining, enriched IL-10-secreting cells were 
stained with surface anti-V8 and intracellularly with either anti-T-bet 
Alexa Fluor 647 or mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody, using permeabili-
zation buffers recommended by the manufacturer (eBioscience). For DC 
co-stimulatory molecule staining, splenic DCs were cultured either alone or 
with an equal number of CD4 + T cells from naive or peptide-treated mice 
in the presence of 100 µg/ml of Ac1-9[4K] and, where indicated, with 
10 µg/ml of anti-IL-10R (clone 1B1.3a) or isotype control (BD) antibody. 
After 24 h, DCs were surface stained with anti-CD11c FITC, anti-CD40 
PE and biotinylated anti-CD80 and anti-CD86 (BD) paired with Streptavi-
din Tricolor (Invitrogen). Fluorescence intensity was measured on a FACS-
Calibur or BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">FlowJo</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Tree Star, Inc.</rs>.) FACS analysis software. </p>

<p>Cytokine protein levels. Multiplex Fluorescent Bead Immunoassay was 
used to measure the amount of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN- in 
mouse serum samples according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bender 
MedSystems). Fluorescence intensity was measured on a FACSCanto flow 
cytometer (BD) and analyzed using the manufacturer's own software. Con-
ventional sandwich ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's 
instructions to assay the quantity of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN- (paired anti-
bodies), and IL-12 (OptEIA kit; BD) in cell culture supernatants. Optical 
densities were measured at 450/595 nm on a SpectraMax 190 microplate 
reader and the amount of cytokines present quantified with standard curves 
using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SoftMax</rs> Pro software (both from <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>). </p>

<p>Crystallization, data collection and structure determination 
HvHsp90-N and AtSgt1a-CS were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio in 
the presence of 5 mM ADP, incubated for 30 min and concentrated 
to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Initial multiple crystals were grown 
by vapour diffusion at 41C against 26% w/v PEG4000, 100 mM Tris 
(pH 8.5) and 200 mM magnesium sulphate. Subsequent streak 
seeding into solutions of 16% w/v PEG4000, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5) 
and 200 mM magnesium sulphate produced single thin plates. 
Crystals were harvested into reservoir solution with addition of 
glycerol (20% v/v) before flash cooling to 100 K. X-ray data were 
collected on beamline ID23 at the ESRF, Grenoble, from single 
crystals, and processed by using <rs type="software">MOSFLM</rs> (Leslie, 1995) and the 
<rs id="software-5" type="software">CCP4</rs> package (CCP4, <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-date">1994</rs>). Crystals had space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with 
three copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit. The thin plate 
crystals have a high solvent content (59% v/v) and only gave useful 
diffraction to 3.3 Å . The structure was solved by molecular 
replacement with Phaser (McCoy, 2007) using ADP-bound yeast

with zero values, the total AHI, REM AHI, 
and NREM AHI were log transformed 
using the formula AHI = log(AHI + 0.01). 
A similar procedure was used for years 
of type 2 diabetes. We used casewise 
diagnostics to identify any outliers. Only 
one outlier was identified (low HbA 1c ), 
and sensitivity analysis excluding this 
subject was performed confirming the 
association between HbA 1c and 
measures of REM OSA severity.

<p>Positron emission tomography CT technique 
and interpretation 
After fasting for least 6 h, patients were administered 370 MBq of 
18 F-FDG intravenously. All patients were instructed to rest 
comfortably for 60 min and to urinate before scanning. Whole-
body PET-CT images were obtained with a Discovery ST scanner 
(GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Seven to eight frames (3 min 
per frame) of emission PET data were acquired in 3D mode after 
a non-contrast CT scan from the base of the skull to the upper 
thigh (tube rotation time of 1 s per revolution, 120 kV, 60 mA, 
7.5 mm per rotation and an acquisition time of 60.9 s for a scan 
length of 867 mm). Emission PET images were reconstructed 
using an iterative method (ordered-subsets expectation maxi-
mization with 2 iterations and 30 subsets; field of view, 600 mm; 
slice thickness, 3.27 mm) and attenuation corrected with non-
contrast CT. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed 
18 F-FDG

To account for potential clustering of deaths within 
each stroke belt region (stroke belt, stroke buckle and 
non-belt), we repeated the analysis (1) using a robust 
variance estimator, and (2) modelling stroke belt region 
as a shared frailty, which are two common approaches to 
analysing clustered data in time-to-event analysis. Owing 
to the time lag in observations and medical record 
retrieval, we could not review medical records for a 
portion of participants with reported hospitalisations for 
a serious infection over the observation period. We 
therefore repeated the analysis excluding these indivi-
duals from the non-sepsis group. We also repeated the 
analysis stratifying by uncomplicated sepsis (infection 
+SIRS criteria only) versus severe sepsis (sepsis+organ 
dysfunction). 
To identify participant characteristics independently 
associated with early death after sepsis, among indivi-
duals with sepsis, only we fit a Cox model with age at 
sepsis, sex, race, tobacco and alcohol use, chronic 
medical conditions, infection type, admission to inten-
sive care unit and SOFA score on hospital presentation 
in the regression model.

For intracellular staining, splenocytes or CNS-infiltrating MNCs were 
stimulated with 25 and 10 μg/ml MOG peptide for 72 hours or overnight, 
respectively, followed by stimulation with 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml 
ionomycin in the presence of GolgiPlug for 5 hours. Cells were surface-
stained with mAbs against CD4 and CD8. Cells were then washed, fixed, 
and permeabilized with FIX&amp;PERM solution (Invitrogen), and intracel-

<p>N 4 (Silantes, 
Munich, Germany). Label incorporation was determined to be 495% by MS 
before cells were used for further experiments. Each labeled population of NIH3T3 
were assigned specific treatments, for example, light, control; medium, TNFa/ 
CHX; and heavy, TNFa/CHX þ Y27632. Each labeled population was used in 
each treatment condition, with Blebbistatin substituting for Y27632 in one set of 
experiments, for a total of six replicates. After 4 h, the supernatants were pooled 
and concentrated with StrataClean resin. Protein was eluted from StrataClean 
resin using 100 ml 1X lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer plus 10 mM DTT 
at 951C for 5 min. This was allowed to cool, adjusted to 50 mM iodoacetamide and 
incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature. Macrophage extracts (in 8 M 
urea) were adjusted to 1X LDS sample buffer, reduced with DTT and alkylated 
with iodoacetamide as described above. The samples were electrophoresed for 
3 cm on a NuPAGE 4-12% gel using MOPS running buffer (Life Technologies, 
Paisley, UK) at 200 V and then stained with colloidal coomasie. The gel lane was 
cut into five even sections, each section cut into 2-mm cubes, destained with 50% 
acetonitrile/100 mM TEAB pH 8, dried and digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin in 50 mM 
TEAB overnight at 301C. Gel pieces were extracted with 50% acetonitrile, extracts 
combined, dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 0.1 ml 5% acetonitrile/0.1% 
formic acid in water. In some experiments, macrophage extracts (50 mg) were 
reduced and alkylated in 8 M urea, diluted to 1 M urea with 50 mM TEAB pH 8 and 
digested in solution with trypsin (1 : 10 w/w) at 301C for 5 h. Tryptic digests were 
analyzed by LC-MS on a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer system coupled 
to a Proxeon Easy-LC HPLC system. The peptide mixtures were loaded onto a 
nanoseparations C18 guard column (0.1 Â 20 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% formic 
acid/water at 5 ml/min and then separated on an LC-Packings PepMap C18 
column (0.075 Â 150 mm equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water. Peptides were 
eluted with a 120 min discontinuous gradient of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at a 
flow rate of 300 nl/min. The column outlet was connected to a Proxeon Flex 
nanospray source fitted with a New Objective FS360 20-10 uncoated emitter and a 
voltage of 2 kV was applied to the emitter. The orbitrap was set to analyze the 
survey scans (m/z 350-2000) at 30 000 resolution and top 10 ions in each duty 
cycle (minimum ion intensity of 5000 cps) were selected for MSMS in the LTQ 
linear ion trap. Ions were excluded for 20 s after two occurrences. The raw files

<p>12. In the <rs type="software">RATS</rs> packages, the equations can be estimated without including the disturbances 
and then transformed via the standard Cholesky decomposition. This decomposition 
picks out a different linear combination of the aggregate demand shocks, but since only 
their joint effect is identified, this difference is inessential. 
13. Blanchard and Quah (1988) use a different technique to estimate models subject to these 
long-run Wold causal orderings. They estimate the unrestricted vector autoregression for 
X, and then transform the system by post-multiplying the VAR by a matrix that imposes 
the necessary restrictions on the long-run multipliers and the residual covariance matrix. 
There is unique matrix that simultaneously diagonalizes the VAR innovation covariance 
matrix and triangularizes the matrix of long-run multipliers. When the only constraints on 
the system are a lower triangular matrix of long-run multipliers and a diagonal innovation 
covariance matrix, the model is just-identified, and this procedure can be thought of as 
"indirect least squares." The instrumental variable approach that we outline can be 
thought of as two stage least squares. When the model is just-identified, these two 
estimation methods produce identical estimators and are equivalent to the FIML estima-
tor. The model that we estimate is overidentified. In particular, oil prices are assumed to 
be strictly exogenous, and this imposes overidentifying restrictions. These overidentifying 
restrictions are easy to impose in our instrumental variable approach, but are much more 
difficult to impose in the indirect least squares approach. </p>

<p>Post-Election Survey 
During the week of November 28, 2016, we conducted an online survey of 
1208 US adults aged 18 and over using the <rs type="software">SurveyMonkey</rs> platform. The sample 
was drawn from SurveyMonkey's Audience Panel, an opt-in panel recruited from 
the more than 30 million people who complete SurveyMonkey surveys every month 
(as described in more detail at https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/audience/). 
The survey consisted of four sections. First, we acquired consent to participate 
and a commitment to provide thoughtful answers, which we hoped would improve 
data quality. Those who did not agree were disqualified from the survey. Second, 
we asked a series of demographic questions, including political affiliation before 
the 2016 campaign, vote in the 2016 presidential election, education, and race/ 
ethnicity. Third, we asked about 2016 election news consumption, including time 
spent on reading, watching, or listening to election news in general and on social 
media in particular, and the most important source of news and information about 
the 2016 election. Fourth, we showed each respondent 15 news headlines about the 
2016 election. For each headline, we asked, "Do you recall seeing this reported or 
discussed prior to the election?" and "At the time of the election, would your best 
guess have been that this statement was true?" We also received age and income 
categories, gender, and census division from profiling questions that respondents 
had completed when they first started taking surveys on the Audience panel. The 
survey instrument can be accessed at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RSYD75P. 
Each respondent's 15 news headlines were randomly selected from a list of 
30 news headlines, six from each of five categories. Within each category, our list 
contains an equal split of pro-Clinton and pro-Trump headlines, so 15 of the 30 arti-
cles favored Clinton, and the other 15 favored Trump. The first category contains 
six fake news stories mentioned in three mainstream media articles (one in the New 
York Times, one in the Wall Street Journal, and one in BuzzFeed) discussing fake news 
during the week of November 14, 2016. The second category contains the four 
most recent pre-election headlines from each of Snopes and PolitiFact deemed to 
be unambiguously false. We refer to these two categories individually as "Big Fake" 
and "Small Fake," respectively, or collectively as "Fake." The third category contains 
the most recent six major election stories from the Guardian's election timeline. 
We refer to these as "Big True" stories. The fourth category contains the two most 
recent pre-election headlines from each of Snopes and PolitiFact deemed to be 
unambiguously true. We refer to these as "Small True" stories. Our headlines in 
these four categories appeared on or before November 7. 
The fifth and final category contains invented "Placebo" fake news headlines, 
which parallel placebo conspiracy theories employed in surveys by Oliver and Wood 
(2014) and Chapman University (2016). As we explain below, we include these </p>

<p>Background: This study was conducted to identify predictors of self-reported academic per-
formance in undergraduate medical students at Hawassa University. 
Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study involving 592 undergraduate medical students was 
conducted in November 2012. The academic performance of the study subjects was measured 
by self-reported cumulative grade point average (GPA) using a self-administered questionnaire. 
Data were entered and analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 16</rs> 
software. Pearson's bivariate correlations, multiple linear regression, and multiple logistic 
regression were used to identify predictors of academic performance. 
Results: The self-reported academic performance of students had been decreasing as the 
academic years progressed, with the highest and lowest performance being in the premedicine 
(mean GPA 3.47) and clinical I (mean GPA 2.71) years, respectively. One hundred and fifty-eight 
(26.7%) of the participants had ever been delayed, 37 (6.2%) had ever re-sat for examination, 
and two (0.3%) had ever been warned due to academic failure. The overall variation in self-
reported academic performance of the students was 32.8%. Participant age alone explained 
21.9% of the variation. On the other hand, university entrance examination results, substance use 
at university, and medicine as first choice by students were identified as predictors of variation 
in self-reported academic performance, accounting for 6.9%, 2.7%, and ,1% of the variation, 
respectively. Students who had never used tobacco, alcohol, or khat after starting university 
were twice as likely to score a self-reported cumulative GPA above 3.0 (adjusted odds ratio 1.95, 
95% confidence interval 1.25-3.02) and less likely to be delayed, have to re-sit an examination, 
or be warned (adjusted odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.29-0.77). 
Conclusion: Only 32.8% of the variation in self-reported academic performance was explained 
by the studied variables. Hence, efficacious mechanisms should be designed to combat the 
intervenable determinants of self-reported academic performance, like substance use and a low 
medical school entrance examination result. Further studies should also be undertaken to gain a 
better understanding of other unstudied determinants, like personality, learning style, cognitive 
ability, and the system used for academic evaluation. 
Academic performance is a key component of medical education that is used by govern-
ing bodies like ministries of education and health and universities to assess whether a 
medical graduate is sufficiently competent and fit to practice medicine. 
1,2 It is also used 
to identify students who are displaying the appropriate level of competence, to enable 
students to ascertain their own academic progress, and to predict the future performance 
of students. 
1,3 The purpose of medical education is to ensure that students meet the </p>

<p>data collection was conducted in lecture halls. Data collectors 
as well as the supervisors were trained assistant lecturers from 
other campuses at HU. Instructions on how to complete the 
questionnaire correctly, particularly on how to follow skip 
patterns, was given to the study subjects before embarking on 
completing the questionnaire. After the questionnaires were 
collected back from the students, the supervisors checked all 
questionnaires for completeness. 
Data were entered, cleaned, and analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 16</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarize and present the data. To determine the relation-
ship between self-reported academic performance and the 
different independent variables, bivariate Pearson's correla-
tion analysis was done three times (for total participants, and 
for preclinical, and clinical student subcategories). Multiple 
linear regression was used to estimate the cumulative and 
individual effects of each independent variable as well as to 
control confounding effects. 
To explain the variability of the outcome variable accord-
ing to the explanatory variables and identify the effects of 
confounding, three multiple linear regression analyses were 
constructed for total participants, clinical, and preclinical 
students. Out of the 20 explanatory variables, we used a back-
ward selection procedure to test several combinations of these 
variables and used a model that gives us the largest adjusted 
R 
2 and the smallest standard error. Regression diagnostics 
were done for the fitness of model. The correlation between 
each of the explanatory variables was less than 0.7, and the 
variance inflation factor was #5. Moreover, linearity and 
other assumptions were guided under the umbrella of central 
limit theory because the sample size was very large. 
For the logistic regression models, a P-value ,0.2 was 
taken as a cut-off point for selecting variables to enter into 
the multiple logistic regression model. A probability value

The <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 16.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, USA) 
was utilized for the statistical analysis. Associations between 
GPER expression and each clinicopathological determinants 
were evaluated by the χ 2 test, the Fisher's exact test (for nom-
inal variables) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for ordinary vari-
ables). Referring to measurement data, non-paired t-test or 
ANOVA process was used to test difference between sub-
groups. Two-tailed p-values of 0.05 or less were considered to 
be statistically significant. </p>

<p>The software <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 11.2</rs>, was used to perform 
the statistical analysis on a cross-sectional basis. Student's 
t-test was used to assess differences between mean values 
and the z-test was used to assess differences between 
proportions. Severe SPAP and mPAP were defined as the 
4 
th quartile in both cases (≥ 120 mmHg and ≥ 76 mmHg 
for SPAP and mPAP, respectively). The relationship between 
echocardiography-derived SPAP and invasive mPAP was 
assessed by Pearson's correlation. Percent agreement and 
Cohen's kappa coefficient for severe classification of SPAP 
and mPAP were also computed. </p>

<p>cultured with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of mon-
ensin (2 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h for IFN-γ and 4 h for 
GrB. Cells were harvested and labeled with CD3, NK1.1, and 
NKp46 antibodies, and subsequently stained with intracellular 
IFN-γ and GrB after fixation and permeabilization. All sam-
ples were acquired on FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience, 
Mountain View, CA, USA), and analyzed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">FlowJo</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 7.6.5</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Tree Star</rs>, San Carlos, CA, USA). Forward scatter 
and side scatter were used to identify lymphocytes, which 
were further used to define NK cell and intracellular ex-
pression of IFN-γ and GrB. </p>

<p>All data were expressed as the average±standard deviation, 
and statistically significant differences between groups were 
analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. Kaplan-
Meier survival curves were analyzed by the log-rank test. A 
p-value≤0.05 was considered significant. All data were ana-
lyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Prism</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">GraphPadPrism4</rs>, San Diego, CA, 
USA). </p>

<p>Image processing was performed at one site: Centre for Neuroimag-
ing Sciences, IoP (KCL). Image quality control was performed using stan-
dardized procedures (Simmons et al., 2011; Simmons et al., 2009). 
Next, the raw 3D T1 MRI data underwent processing for surface-based 
cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the Freesurfer 
image analysis software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</rs>/) version 5.1 
installed on a CentOS4 x86_64 cluster. There are several rationales for 
using Freesurfer in our study. Firstly, the surface-based registration ap-
proach incorporated into this software has been shown to have better re-
producibility compared to Laplacian-or Registration-based methods for 
cortical thickness estimation (Clarkson et al., 2011). Secondly, this frame-
work provides a range of different kinds of surface-based and volumetric 
measurements, as well as different parcellation atlases for extracting av-
eraged morphometric data. The steps of this processing are described in 
detail elsewhere (Ségonne et al., 2007; Ségonne et al., 2004; Fischl and 
Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 1999; Dale et al., 1999; Sled et al., 1998). 
The surface-based pipeline produced several morphometric mo-
dalities (cortical thickness, Jacobian maps, and sulcal depth). After the 
Freesurfer steps, cortical models from each individual were registered 
to a spherical atlas, providing matching across subjects, and finally 
327,684 normalized measurements acquired for every subject were 
concatenated into large matrices (one for each high-dimensional mor-
phometric modality). 
41 volumetric measurements for all subjects were corrected for intra-
cranial volume (ICV) using linear modelling (removing linear effects of 
ICV) and finally concatenated into an n-by-41 matrix that was used in 
the subsequent analysis. 
The image post-processing and analysis steps are illustrated in 
Appendix: Fig. A1. </p>

<p><rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> statistical software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">17.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs>, USA) was used for data 
processing. The data were mostly expressed as the median 
and interquartile range (IQR). Concentration differences 
between the TPE and MPE groups were evaluated for 
statistical significance using the nonparametric Mann-
Whitney U-test. The optimal sensitivity and specificity points 
were selected as the critical values using the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; in this way, 
we calculated, for each of the TMs, the sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value 
for diagnosing TPE and MPE. In addition, we evaluated 
the ability of a combination of all five TMs to distinguish 
between TPE and MPE. Three prognostic models were 
constructed: Model 1 involved the serum level of TMs, 
Model 2 the pleural fluid level, and Model 3 the P/S ratio. 
P &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>Neuroretina thickness quantification: The thickness of the 
neuroretina and the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) 
and the inner nuclear layer (INL) were measured on toluidine 
blue histological images with <rs id="software-2" type="software">Image J</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">1.47v</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">NIH Image</rs>, 
National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). Measurements 
were performed in representative serial sections. Neuroretina 
thickness was determined between the outer and the inner 
limiting membranes. In each case, six measurements were 
performed in 20X images from each of the neuroretina 
explants (n=20). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">R Statistical Software</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">version 3.1.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Foundation for Statistical Computing</rs>, Vienna, Austria). The means and standard devia-
tions were calculated for continuous variables. The statistical 
significance level was set at 5%. </p>

<p>A Kruskal one-way ANOVA (ANOVA) was used to 
compare the mean thicknesses of freshly isolated neuroretinas 
and those cultured for 9 days alone or for 9 days in coculture 
with RPE cells. The homogeneity of variance assumption was 
checked with the robust Brown-Forsythe Levene-type test 
using the group medians as implemented in <rs type="software">R lawstat package</rs> 
[17]. When the homogeneity of variance was not validated, 
the Welch test was used for comparison of the mean values. </p>

<p>A copy of the course curriculum is included in the Supplemen-

sign, power analysis, data pre-processing, quality control, 
exploratory data analysis, class discovery, differential expres-
sion and class prediction. The <rs type="software">BRB-Array Tools</rs> software, 
based on an <rs type="software">Excel</rs> interface of <rs type="software">R BioConductor</rs> packages, 
was used for demonstrations by the instructors ollowed by 
hands-on sessions by the participants. This software was se-
lected since it allowed participants with a diverse computa-
tional background to learn the fundamental data analysis 
steps in a user-friendly environment. Additional bioinformat-
ics instruction was provided on the final days of the workshop 
and covered additional online resources such as Genome 
Browsers, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Promoter Analysis, 
Gene Ontology Analysis, Database Resources for Genetic 
Variations and Disorders and in later years, an introduction 
to Next-generation Sequencing Data Analysis. </p>

<p>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Participant responses were analysed for frequencies, 
means and SDs as indicated. Participant characteristics 
were correlated with their interview responses. 
Nulliparous women were excluded from analysis of ques-
tions related to prior deliveries. Respondents with 
missing data were dropped from all analyses. Fisher's 
exact test was used to evaluate categorical variables and 
Student's t test was used for continuous variables. All 
analyses were performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.9.1.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, 
Cary, North Carolina, USA). Our primary outcomes of 
interest were facility delivery rate assessed in the commu-
nity and caesarean delivery rate in a regional hospital. 
Data were kept anonymous at all times by removing all 
identifiers. Ethical approval was granted by the 
Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board and the 
Medical Director of the Liberian hospital. </p>

<p>Both datasets were analyzed equally by permutation 
analysis. The KC-SMART permutation analysis was 
performed to create a null distribution, and peaks were 
detected at P &lt; 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected for multiple 
testing), for kernel widths: 6 = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 
24, 30 and 40 Mb. One thousand permutations were used. 
The interpolation, as discussed below, was performed for 
an interval [2, 40] Mb, with steps of 0.2 Mb and was 
only applied to the mouse dataset. <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> scripts used 
for implementation of the method are available from 
the authors upon request. </p>

<p>The cancer gene census (CGC) list was retrieved from the 
Internet 
(www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/). 
Mapping information was retrieved from the Ensembl 
database (www.ensembl.org) using the <rs type="software">Biomart</rs> data 
mining tool. Only genes with valid mapping information 
were used. The genes described in the CGC were divided </p>

<p>Genes found significant by correlation were compiled into 
gene lists according to method (KC-SMART, STAC) and 
according to gain/loss status. Only genes with valid Entrez 
and Ensembl IDs that were present on the gene expression 
microarray platform were considered. As background, 
gene list of all genes with Entrez and Ensembl Ids on the 
array platform was used. Association with cancer was 
calculated using the <rs id="software-3" type="software">DAVID</rs> web interface (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov</rs>) and as described in ref. 24. </p>

<p>STAC analysis. STAC inputs data discretized to three 
levels: 1, 0 and À1. The raw data used for frequency 
analysis are described in Chin et al. (22) and were 
segmented using the parameter-free segmentation algo-
rithm CBS (25) and assigned copy number change using 
MergeLevels (13), courtesy of J. Fridlyand. All positive 
copy number changes were counted as gains (1); all 
negative copy number changes were counted as losses (À1) 
and no copy-number change was set to 0. We followed the 
advice on the <rs id="software-4" type="software">STAC</rs> website (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">cbil.upenn.edu/STAC</rs>/) and 
divided each chromosome arm into stretches of 1 Mb. 
A stretch was called aberrant whenever a BAC clone 
present in that stretch was called aberrant. Stretches 
containing no BACs were set to 1/À1 when both 
neighbors were 1/À1, 0 when one of them was 0. The 
preprocessed data were loaded into the STAC 1.2 java 
applet and analyzed using 1000 permutations and a 1-Mb 
span constant. The OR regions were defined by either the 
frequency statistic or the footprint statistic being P &lt; 0.05. 
The 'AND' regions were defined by both the frequency 
statistic and the footprint statistic being P &lt; 0.05. </p>

<p>Individuals included in the analysis participated in the DPT-1 oral insulin trial 
(5). All oral insulin trial participants were relatives of T1D patients who were 
positive for islet cell autoantibodies and insulin autoantibodies. The partic-
ipants initially had normal oral glucose tolerance (fasting glucose value ,110 
mg/dL; 30-, 60-, and 90-min values ,200 mg/dL; 2-h value ,140 mg/dL) and 
were above defined FPIR thresholds ($100 mU/mL for $8.0 years [with the 
exception of $60 mU/mL for parents of T1D patients], $60 mU/mL for ,8.0 
years). IVGTTs were performed at baseline and at yearly intervals. DPT-1 
parenteral trial participants (6) were not included in the analyses because they 
only had IVGTTs at 2-year intervals, and many in that trial were selected on 
the basis of having low FPIR values. T1D was diagnosed either through oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) surveillance according to standard American 
Diabetes Association criteria or through clinical presentation. Two non-
progressors with baseline FPIR values of 675 mU/mL and 953 mU/mL (474 
mU/mL being the next highest value) were excluded from the analysis because 
they were outliers. In addition, three others were excluded because of missing 
values. 
The IVGTTs were performed after a minimum 10-h fast. A standard infusion 
of 0.5 g/kg to a maximum of 35 g at a 25% glucose concentration was ad-
ministered over a 3-min period. Samples were obtained in the fasting state and 
at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min. The FPIR was defined as the sum of the insulin 
measurements at 1 and 3 min. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay 
(coefficient of variation ,8.5%) (7). There was high cross-reactivity with 
proinsulin. Autoantibody procedures for DPT-1 have been previously de-
scribed (8). 
Data analysis. For progressors to be included in the analysis, in addition to the 
baseline FPIR measurement, at least one additional FPIR measurement before 
diagnosis was required. There were 74 progressors who fulfilled this criterion of 
whom 44 (59%) were diagnosed through OGTT surveillance. (Supplementary 
Table 1 shows that there were no significant differences in baseline charac-
teristics between the progressors included in and the progressors excluded 
from the analysis.) There were no significant differences between the 35 (47%) 
receiving oral insulin and the 39 (53%) receiving placebo in the baseline FPIR 
values or in the changes from the baseline FPIR to the last FPIR. Two analyses 
were used to examine changes in the FPIR during the progression to T1D in 
these individuals. A longitudinal analysis (analysis 1) examined serial FPIR 
values in the 26 progressors who had three IVGTTS after the baseline IVGTT: 
2-3 years before diagnosis, 1-2 years before diagnosis, and within 1 year of 
diagnosis (see flowchart in the Supplementary Data). The mean times from 
diagnosis of the FPIR measurements within each of the yearlong intervals are 
shown in the RESULTS for simplicity. 
In the other analysis (analysis 2), the change in the FPIR value per year from 
the baseline FPIR to the last FPIR before diagnosis was calculated for each 
individual (n = 74). The change in the FPIR per year was then used as the 
dependent variable for simple linear regression and multiple regression 
models. The independent variable of interest was the time to diagnosis from 
the midpoint of the time interval between the baseline FPIR and the last FPIR 
(Fig. 1). The other variables included in the multiple regression analysis were 
the FPIR measurement at baseline and the time between the baseline and the 
last FPIR measurements. Coefficients from the multivariate model were used 
to develop a curve describing the change in the FPIR during the progression to 
T1D (Supplementary Data) in the 48 progressors who were not included in 
analysis 1. The pattern of change in FPIR during progression in those indi-
viduals was then compared with the pattern of change in the 26 progressors 
studied in analysis 1. 
Wilcoxon rank sum and t tests were used for comparisons. Analyses of 
covariance were used to adjust for comparisons between groups. <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.1.3</rs> software was used for the analyses. The P values are two-sided. Although </p>

<p>the various comparisons were determined following 
log transformation (referred to as ln_outcome) of both 
outcome and predictors. Data transformation permitted a 
comparison of the magnitude of the slope values between 
different outcome and predictors. A significant slope value 
for a given comparison was established when its 95% CIs 
did not include 0, as previously reported (3). All statistical 
analyses were conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v 9.4</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2013</rs>;

<p>METHODS: A total number of 71 women with type II diabetes were randomly assigned to 
2 groups to receive either omega-3 capsules or placebo capsules. In the first step, a 
questionnaire consisting age, height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure was filled out for each subject. Blood samples were then collected for 
laboratory tests. The next step was to conduct 8 weeks of intervention. All variables, except age, 
were measured again after the intervention. Hip circumference was considered as the maximum 
circumference of the buttocks. Waist circumference was measured by placing a tape horizontally 
across the abdomen at the end of a normal exhalation. Laboratory tests included the assessment 
of visfatin, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations. Lipid profile, i.e. low 
density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and cholesterol, 
was also assessed. Using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs><rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18</rs>, data obtained from the study was analyzed by a variety of 
appropriate statistical tests. </p>

<p>The current study was performed in three phases. 
In the first phase, all patients filled out a 
questionnaire including age, height, weight, waist 
circumference, hip circumference, and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure. Blood samples were also 
collected for blood tests. In the second stage, after 8 
weeks of intervention, the same parameters were 
measured and blood samples were obtained again. 
Hip circumference was measured at the widest part. 
Waist circumference was also measured by a cord at 
the end of a normal exhalation. Blood pressure was 
measured by a mercury sphygmomanometer in a 
sitting position and after 10 minutes of rest. 
Visfatin level was measured by standard kits using 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
method with a sensitivity of 30 pg/ml (Human 
Visfatin Kit, Adipogen Inc., South Korea). Both the 
examiner and the participants were blinded to the 
intervention. Blood sampling was conducted after 
10-12 hours of fasting (10 cc in each time) before 
taking the anti-diabetic tablets. 
All the tests were conducted automatically by 
Hitachi 911. Data was analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs><rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">18</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, US</rs>). The Fisher's exact test was 
used to analyze qualitative data and student's t-test for 
quantitative data. Weight changes were analyzed by 
chi-square test while Pearson's correlation test was 
used to assess correlations. Moreover, paired t-test 
was used for comparing blood pressure changes 
before and after the intervention in both groups and 
independent t-test was used for comparing mean 
concentration changes between the two groups. To 
detect the correlations between variables, Pearson's 
regression analysis was used. </p>

<p>Figure 1 shows how dramatic the increase in software patenting 
has been. The figure plots the total number of patents in force that are 
relevant to 27 distinct software product markets between 1980 and 2006. 
Over this period the CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of the total 
number of patents outstanding was 29.8%. Over the decade from 1994 to 
2004 alone, the number of patents in the average market in our sample 
grew by almost 600%, while the number of active firms grew by less 
than 300%. By 2006, the average market in this sample had 5,858 patents 
in force, collectively asserting more than 127,000 claims. 
Data such as these suggest that costs associated with patents-
searching prior art, building patent portfolios, and defending against 
the threat of patent litigation-have grown very substantially, and may 
now be having a significantly negative impact on the pace of innovation 
in the industry. To cite just two authoritative observers, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Donald Knuth</rs>, 
author of The Art of Computer Programming and inventor of <rs id="software-0" type="software">TeX</rs>, has 
stated that "I don't think I would have been able to create TeX if 
the present [patent] climate had existed in the 1970s," while erstwhile 
entrepreneur Bill Gates has opined that "If people had understood how 
patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented and 
had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill 
today." </p>

<p>36. These effects were obtained by calculating the pre-and post-regime change 
difference in the partial derivative with respect to the log of patents in the market, using 
<rs type="software">Stata</rs>'s predictnl command. This command computes standard errors via the delta method. 
See Ai and Norton (2003) for more on interaction effects in nonlinear models. 
37. With only 243 observations, a full set of market and year fixed effects, and limited 
independent variation in some of these control variables these estimates are somewhat 
sensitive to the set of controls that are included. </p>

<p>40. These graphs were created using <rs type="software">Stata</rs>'s sts command, which estimates separate 
Cox regressions for each percentile group. Adjusting for the number of incumbents means 
that the number of incumbents and the number of incumbents squared were included as 
covariates in the Cox regression. </p>

2. Use the cryo-stage in the SEM. 
3. Insert the light-collecting elliptical mirror from parking position to measuring position into the SEM. 
4. Mount a test sample (here: bulk GaAs sample) with a direct band gap transition on the stage. 
5. Evacuate the SEM chamber until the column chamber valve opens. Set the SEM imaging parameters acceleration high voltage (HV) to 20

be focused on the sample surface at a working distance (WD) of 15 mm. 
7. Run the start-up procedure of the <rs type="software">CL</rs> detection system by switching on the power supply for the monochromator, the high-voltage power 
supply for photomultiplier tube (PMT), the PMT cooling system and the laptop with the CL control program. Start the <rs type="software">CL</rs> control program and

9. Create a log file for recording the experiments. 
10. Adjust the light-collecting mirror to maximize the integral <rs type="software">CL</rs> intensity on the test sample by tilting and rotating the mirror. Record a CL test 
spectrum using the CL control program. 
11. Vent the SEM chamber, remove the test sample, mount the actual sample on indium foil on the sample holder and evacuate the SEM 
chamber. 
12. Link the outlet for cryogenic gases of the SEM with the inlet of a diaphragm pump by flexible vacuum tubes. Use centering rings with an o-
ring as a sealing element and fix it with the clamping rings. Stabilize the system mechanically by integration of a damping weight in the hose 
coupling. 
13. Connect the outlet of the diaphragm pump by a flexible vacuum tube to a He recirculation system if it is available. Use centering rings with an 
o-ring as a sealing element and fix it with clamping rings. 
14. Connect the temperature sensor of the temperature control unit with the appropriate plug connector on the SEM stage. Switch on the power 
supply of the temperature control unit. 
15. Assemble heating tape on the flexible vacuum tube next to the outlet for cryogenic gases of the SEM. 
16. Wear protective glasses and protective gloves. Insert the tubing for the liquid He into the LHe Dewar. Connect the outlet of the He transfer

to 1, the magnification to 200 and the noise reduction to pixel average. 
18. Use the Everhart Thornley detector for imaging with secondary electrons. Move the stage towards the pole piece and focus the electron 
beam onto the sample surface at WD = 15 mm for the CL experiments. 
19. Choose the area of interest on the sample surface and scan on the whole region during the entire cooling-down procedure. Ensure that 
during the entire CL experiment the surface of the sample in the region of interest is at WD = 15 mm by an appropriate positioning of the 
stage. 
20. Start the cooling-down procedure by entering the lowest target temperature (e.g., 5 K) and appropriate parameters for the PID control into the 
temperature controller according to the technical manual. Open the valve of the LHe transfer tube. 
21. Monitor the sample temperature, the He pressure from the diaphragm pump, and the integral CL signal output from the PMT during cooling-
down procedure. Reduce the slit width of the monochromator if the CL intensity becomes too high at low temperatures to avoid damaging the 
PMT. 
22. Increase the orifice of the LHe transfer tube if necessary to reach the target temperature. 
23. Re-establish the WD = 15 mm for focused images after reaching the target temperature. Rectify the adjustment of the light-collecting mirror 
for maximum integral CL intensity on the actual sample. 
24. Set appropriate values for the grating (300 lines per mm, blaze at 1,000 nm), spectral region (1,050 to 1,600 nm), step width (5 nm), time per 
measuring point (5 sec) and slit width (1 mm) for spectral CL measurements on the silicon sample. Record <rs type="software">CL</rs> spectra of the sample using 
the CL control program and save them to the hard disk of the laptop. </p>

<p>25. Choose the planar mirror in the monochromator for panchromatic CL imaging and a blaze grating at particular wavelength for monochromatic 
CL imaging, respectively. Adjust the brightness and contrast values of the CL image in the linear range of the dependence of the grey values 
from the PMT signal. 
26. Adjust appropriate image resolution (e.g., 1,024 x 768 pixels), scan speed and noise reduction method for CL imaging (e.g., for a 
magnification in the range between 200 and 1,000 the lowest scan speed 14 combined with pixel average, or higher scan speed 8 combined 
with line average over 20 lines). Record CL images with the <rs type="software">SEM</rs> control program and save them to the hard disk of the computer. 
27. Enter name and parameters of each spectrum and image measured during the whole measuring session into the log file. 
28. Switch off the HV of the electron beam and close the SEM column chamber valve before changing the sample temperature by entering a 
higher target temperature into the temperature controller for temperature dependent CL investigations. 
Note: This is to avoid a shut-down of the electron gun by instabilities of the SEM chamber vacuum during heating-up. 
29. Open the SEM column chamber valve and switch on the HV when the new target temperature is reached and the system vacuum in the SEM 
chamber is stable again. 
30. Switch off the HV of the electron beam, close the SEM column chamber valve, close the shutter for the PMT, switch off the power supply and 
cooler of the PMT and run the warm-up procedure after finishing the planned CL measurements at low temperatures. 
31. Remove the additional devices and tools which have been assembled for the cryo-CL experiment without opening the SEM chamber. 
32. Leave the SEM chamber closed for at least 12 hr. Check to ensure that the temperature of the sample holder is at RT. Otherwise, heat up the 
sample holder to RT before opening the SEM chamber. 
Note: This is to prevent moisture in the SEM chamber. 
33. Remove the sample from the stage and evacuate the SEM chamber. </p>

<p>4. Switch off the electron beam acceleration voltage and close the column chamber valve. 
5. Turn on the power supply for the EBSD detector. Move the EBSD detector from parking position to measuring position in the SEM chamber. 
6. Open the column chamber valve and switch on the electron beam acceleration voltage. Re-focus the electron beam on a region of interest on 
the sample surface. 
7. Open the <rs type="software">EBSD</rs> control software and load the calibration file for the chosen WD. 
8. Set up the measurement in the <rs type="software">EBSD</rs> control software according to the operating manual. 
9. Perform the background acquisition according to the EBSD operating manual. 
10. Read out the position of the <rs type="software">EBSD</rs> pattern center and the detector distance for the chosen WD from the EBSD control software. 
11. Focus the electron beam in a region of the sample adjacent to the region of interest for the actual measurements. Leave the beam to scan 
there for about 1 hr for stabilization. 
12. Check the amount of beam drift which must not exceed more than 1 µm during the whole EBSD measurement. 
13. Navigate the electron beam to the region of interest and re-focus. 
14. Schedule line scans parallel to the tilt axis in the region of interest. Use the beam mapping (not stage mapping) setting. Select appropriate 
values for the number of steps (e.g., 100), step size (e.g., 50 nm), exposure time (e.g., 43 msec), frame average (e.g., 10) and detector 
binning (e.g., 2 x 2). 
15. Be sure to select "save all images". Disable indexing to speed up the measurement. 
16. Run the line scans until the last scan is finished. 
17. Switch off the electron beam acceleration voltage and close the column chamber valve. 
18. Retract the EBSD detector from the measuring position to park position and turn off the EBSD control unit. 
19. Vent the chamber, remove the sample and evacuate. </p>

<p>1. Use the in-house written software "<rs id="software-0" type="software">ccEBSD</rs>" programmed by <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Paul Chekhonin</rs> for the evaluation of the recorded EBSD patterns. 
2. Choose an appropriate EBSD pattern that will act as the reference pattern from a measuring point that should be located in a specimen area 
absent of strains. 
3. Apply at least 15 widely distributed regions of interest on the pattern. 
4. Use the coordinates of the pattern center and the detector distance which were determined by the <rs type="software">EBSD</rs> control software for the further 
evaluation. 
5. Enter the rest of the parameters relevant for the evaluation, i.e., elastic constants of the analyzed material, number of steps in the line scan 
and step size, detector size and its resolution in pixels, detector and specimen tilt angles as well as the detector binning. 
6. Use a band pass filter during the calculation of the 2-dimensional Fourier transformation (inner filter of 6 pixels and outer filter of 40 pixels). 
7. Run the evaluation program. 
8. Read out the numerical results from the evaluation text file "protocol.txt" using a conventional spreadsheet program when the calculation is 
finished. </p>

<p>The Kikuchi pattern stored as 8-bit JPEGs were evaluated by Fourier transformation (FT) and cross-correlation with a program "<rs id="software-9" type="software">ccEBSD</rs>" written 
by one of the authors (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">PC</rs>). The program is based on the algorithm developed by Wilkinson et.al. </p>

<p>. The combination of the results from all sub-patterns of 
one Kikuchi pattern improves the accuracy of the strain evaluation. The statistical error determined from a <rs type="software">ccEBSD</rs> line scan on a defect free 
region in a silicon single crystal is found to be 2 x 10 
-4 for all the strain tensor components. Nevertheless, to obtain quantitative results for the </p>

<p>The situation for the use of ccEBSD is easier for a Si wafer ([001]-surface orientation) treated by a high-energy electron beam to induce a liquid 
phase re-crystallization (see Figure 4). Around the track of re-crystallization, slip lines are visible in the BSE image indicating a dislocation 
movement on slip planes with traces parallel to the edges of the image (Figure 4A). The CL investigations were performed under the same 
experimental conditions as for the plastically deformed sample. The mono-CL images, recorded at the energies of the band-to-band transition 
and of the D4 and D2 dislocation luminescence bands (Figures 4B, 4C and 4D, respectively), show the spatial distribution of the extended 
defects caused by the re-crystallization procedure. A local anti-correlation between the band-to-band transition and the D line luminescence 
bands can be inferred from the mono-CL images. This is supported by the CL spectra (Figure 4E) which were measured at sample positions 
1, 2 and 3 (cf. Figure 4A) in spot mode of the electron beam. From the <rs type="software">ccEBSD</rs> investigations performed as a line scan in front of the re-
crystallization track (white line in Figure 4A), the local strain tensor components along the line scan could be determined (Figures 4F and 4G). 
It was proven, that within the statistical error, the values do not depend on which particular Kikuchi pattern was used as the reference pattern if 
this pattern is situated in a region where the band-to-band transition is dominant. The dislocation related electronic transitions appear when the 
sum of normal strains Tr(ε) exceeds a value of 5 x 10 </p>

<p>. Because Tr(ε) is not equal to zero for the scan in a region of about 150 µm length close 
to the re-crystallization track, there is a mean lattice dilation in a volume near to the sample surface. According to the linear theory of elasticity, 
the normal stress σ 33 is equal to zero as presupposed in the evaluation program "<rs type="software">ccEBSD</rs>". If there is a crack on the EBSD line scan, then a 
<rs type="software">ccEBSD</rs> evaluation cannot be performed over the whole scan with one reference pattern due to abrupt variations of the Kikuchi pattern caused 
by the geometrical effects of the crack. </p>

<p>giving by households which itemize charitable 
contributions are similar to tax return data except 
for the very top of the income distribution. The 
COPPS data have a distinct advantage in exam-
ining the charitable behavior of nonitemizers 
as such data are unavailable from tax returns.

From the total sample, we dropped house-
holds with a head residing in a foreign country 
(43 observations), for which the respondent was 
not the head or the wife (206) or the philan-
thropy module questions were not asked (6), 
cohabitating (772), or with a separated or unclear 
marital status (367). Additionally, we dropped 
observations with missing values on important 
variables: 342 on educational level, 30 on race, 
12 on life satisfaction, and one on age, all of 
the household head. Finally, 153 "borderline 
itemizer" households (explained below) were 
eliminated. This left us with an estimation sam-
ple of 6,758 households whose marital status is 
married with husband and wife living together, 
single head of household, or single. All variable 
definitions and weighted sample statistics are 
provided in Table 1. 
The dependent variables are donations to 
organizations who help people in need of food, 
shelter, or other basic necessities (needy), to 
CP&amp;IA/peace organizations, and to all other 
charities (all other). These data were taken 
directly or calculated from the COPPS database 
which identifies monetary donations to charita-

<p>Immunoprecipitation of the concentrated proteins was 
carried out with protein A sepharose beads (10-1141, 
Invitrogen) essentially as described by the manufacturer. 
293T cells were transfected with phCMV empty vector, 
phCMV-syncyntin-2 WT, phCMV-syncytin-2 N312Q 
and phCMV-syncytin-2 T522M plasmids, respectively. 
After transfection for 48 h, the cells were lysed by sus-
pension in ice-cold lysis buffer for 1 h. Lysates were col-
lected after centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min and 
immunoprecipitated with 3 mg anti-syncytin-2 antibody. 
Following an overnight incubation, samples were added 
to 30 ml of protein A bead slurry and rotated for 4 hours 
at 4 
C. After centrifuging and washing 3 times, samples 
were separated on an SDS-PAGE resolving gel and sub-
jected to direct mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Using 
the LTQ-orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher

<p>Morphological analysis was performed on adult indi-
viduals of a subset from 19 locations (226 individuals) and 
eight samples (38 individuals), from the Malacological 
Collection of the Senckenberg-Museum Frankfurt am 
Main, of the four presumed subspecies (Table 1). The data 
set for morphological and genetic analysis overlapped 
in 105 individuals for sampled populations and two 
individuals for the museum samples. The locations of first 
descriptions for the subspecies C. u. unifasciata and C. u. 
rugosiuscula are not very well described in literature, but 
the approximate areas were included in our sampling 
scheme (see Table 1). A lectotype locality exists for C. u. 
acosmia (Gittenberger 1993) that was not sampled. However, 
in the original description (Bourguignat 1882), neither type 
locality nor distribution range were given. C. u. soosiana 
was first described from Budapest/Hungary ( Wagner 1933) 
and is represented by two Museum samples. Individuals 
were photographed through a Zeiss ZV8 binocular with 
10× enlargement from the front and 30× from above, 
always including a ruler on the image. The paper prints 
were digitalized with a resolution of 300 pixel / inch. 
Variables for the morphological analysis were chosen 
based on the original descriptions of the presumed sub-
species of C. unifasciata (Michaud 1831; Bourguignat 1882; 
Wagner 1933; Gittenberger 1993). Eight variables repres-
enting three character sets were measured by digital 
image analysis from the individuals. Shell sculpture traits as 
the first character set were measured through rib-spacing 
as an average distance between ribs, coarseness as an 
average distance between a base line and perimeter of ribs, 
and regularity of ribs as the coefficient of variation of inter-
rib distances. Size independent shell shape (shape 1, 2 and 
3) was assessed through the use of the first three relative warp 
scores of a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) analysis (Rohlf 1995). 
This geometrical analysis of shape was based on 55 land-
marks applied to an electronic image of the individual. The 
height and breadth measurements of the shell were taken. 
These standardized shell morphology variables were 
used to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) 
and discriminant analysis (DA), with <rs id="software-59" type="software">statistica</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-59" type="creator">StatSoft,Inc.</rs>. <rs corresp="#software-59" type="version-date">1995</rs>). The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) type (A or B) 
of the respective individual resulting from 16S analysis </p>

<p>was applied as grouping variable in DA. Museum speci-
mens and not genetically typed individuals were then 
classified a posteriori with equal a priori probability to 
belong to one of the respective groups. 
Euclidean squared distance matrices between all indi-
viduals were calculated for all standardized shell varia-
bles together and for each of the 10 variables separately. 
These matrices were used to perform an analysis of mor-
phological variance in the same way as described above 
for the distance matrix derived from haplotypes. Standard 
deviations and confidence intervals of the M-statistics 
were obtained by bootstrapping 100 times over popula-
tions. Note, however, that these derived F-statistics 
(named here M ST for distinction) cannot directly be com-
pared to Spitze's (1993) Q ST and similar coefficients (e.g. 
Yang et al. 1996), because we have no information about 
the heritability of the measured traits. Estimates of herit-
ability of quantitative traits were obtained in these studies 
from elaborated breeding designs or a priori information 
about relatedness. Such information was not available for 
C. unifasciata. Hence, the presented population fixation 
indices comprise not only their genetic component, but are 
also indications of the total morphologic variance. 
Associations between genetic, morphological and geo-
graphical distance between populations were explored 
through Mantel-tests on the pairwise population fixation 
indices derived from amova analysis to test for parallel 
evolution between genetic and morphological data and 
isolation by distance, respectively. 
Partial least square (PLS) analysis was performed using 
the PLS option of the package <rs id="software-65" type="software">ntsys-pc</rs> version <rs corresp="#software-65" type="version-number">2.2f</rs> to 
assess the correlations between the average population 
values of quantitative shell traits on the one hand and environ-
mental variables for each population on the other. </p>

To explain high levels of HOMA-IR in

<p>A total of four drives are provided within 
the DataLab for each user in a Windows 
environment. 
The H: drive is the researcher's personal 
drive. It contains an 'Application' folder and a 
'Clearance' folder. The 'Application' folder is 
for the researcher to save and access any code, 
project information and output files in the 
course of their work. If the researcher has any 
pre-prepared code files, Word/PDF documents 
or public data files they may wish to use then 
these will be accessible in this folder once they 
have been cleared and loaded by CaMD. The 
'Clearance' folder is where the researcher 
places analytical results that require vetting. 
Those microdata files that the researcher 
has been given approval to use can be found in 
the V: drive. Project teams have access to a 
shared project space-the S: drive-within 
their individual virtual workspaces. The shared 
project spaces have been designed to facili-
tate collaboration and enable the team to 
complete their research/project end to end 
before requesting a release of outputs to be 
used for public dissemination. 
The L: drive is a read-only drive designed to 
mimic 'Google' in a way. As the DataLab is a 
contained environment with no internet access, 
this drive has been created to house analytical 
reference material, publicly available code and 
any other material that researchers may 
routinely use or search for in the normal course 
of their work. 
In relation to package add-ons, researchers 
can request for CaMD to have these loaded on 
their behalf. For example, a researcher who is 
using <rs type="software">STATA</rs> may need an add-on, such as 
'svr', that is not available in the ABS licensed 
package within the DataLab. A request can be 
made to CaMD to have this added into the </p>

mata)]. For statistical analysis, Student's t-test was performed. For guard cell 
aperture measurements, rosette leaves of 5-week-old plants were floated in 
opening buffer (10 mM KCl, 7.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MES-KOH, at pH 6.15) 
and incubated at 20 
C under light conditions for 2 h to open the stomata. 
Subsequently, the same opening buffer was supplemented with either 15 mM 
ABA, 1 mM H 2 O 2 or 1 mM CaCl 2 , and the leaves were incubated for another 2 h. 
The stomatal apertures (width divided by length) along three different epider-
mal transects were measured using a Nikon Eclipse Ti (with Nikon Digital Sight 
DS-Fi1c digital camera) and <rs type="software">Nikon NIS Elements AR</rs> software. No less than 60 
mature stomata were analyzed per transect. </p>

<p>representation of themselves are consistent over time. Strictly speaking, none of these four 
assumptions is true. Huberty defines three orders of viable big data business models. The first 
two of these are already well-known: the third-order business model is in essence online 
advertising; the second-order business model is online retailing. Huberty argues that the real 
changes will come from the first-order business models that are deeply embedded in, and 
reliant upon, data generated from and around real-world phenomena. Here, he cites products 
such as Nest thermostats that utilize direct home appliance data to make valuable decisions or 
the <rs type="software">Google Translate</rs> function that provides a big data service directly. He believes that these 
types of applications are where the true value of big data can be realized. 
Kushida (2014) concentrates on the politics of ICT commoditization, i.e., he argues that 
national-level political and socio-economical dynamics influenced the rapid disruptions expe-
rienced by global ICT industries. His analysis suggests that local regulatory and technology 
choices played critical roles in shaping globally disruptive business models driving commod-
itization. Thus, global industry disruptions are shaped by a set of local political bargains 
particularly in the early stages of technological trajectories. In the context of mobile telecom-
munications, operators won the early political fights in Japan and equipment manufacturers in 
Europe, but eventually US-based computing-centric leaders emerged and ultimately commod-
itized all other players, both domestically and internationally. Even though-in the context of 
ICT-technological opportunities have been largely symmetric and we are often compelled to 
study variations in business strategies in an effort to explain competitive outcomes, Kushida's 
observations suggest that the underlying trajectories of global competition were shaped by 
national political dynamics. 
Ali-Yrkkö and Rouvinen (2014) study ICT-enabled global value chains (GVCs). 
Overall, they suggest that value added is less tied to tangible aspects of GVCs than 
conventional wisdom suggests; typically most value added is attributable to services and 
intellectual property, which, in part, is attributable to deepening digitalization. The 
authors challenge much of the previous GVC literature, which concentrated on high-
end electronics. For example, they study several cases in which the same product is 
assembled by the same company in two locations, in Finland and abroad-most often in 
China. As they compare Finnish value added with local versus offshored final assembly, 
they find that the outcomes vary with the characteristics of the product: Finnish value 
added is only two percentage points lower for a high-end smartphone (local vs offshored 
assembly), while it is ten percentage points lower for a low-end feature phone, and nearly 
30 percentage points lower, on average, for all machinery and metal products. They 
suggest that the complexity and heterogeneity of GVCs is under appreciated in prior 
literature. Furthermore, the commonly held belief that offshoring is ubiquitous may 
exaggerate its importance, as they find that value chains for basic products and services 
are not nearly as global as those of advanced products. </p>

<p>plasmids or bacteriophages (2,9-11). A prokaryotic 
genome may harbour up to 16 CRISPR clusters with the 
same or a different DR. In a genome, a single CRISPR is 
generally associated with a family of genes called cas for 
CRISPR-associated (8,12), encoding proteins showing 
functional similarity with components of the eukaryotic 
RNA interference (RNAi) systems (13). In addition, it was 
demonstrated in two archaea, Archaeoglobus fulgidus (14) 
and Sulfolobus solfataricus (15), that the CRISPR locus 
is transcribed into small RNAs (smRNA) probably 
from one of the flanking regions, the leader, acting as a 
promoter. These observations and the viral origin 
of spacers have led to the hypothesis that the CRISPR-
associated system (CASS) is a prokaryotic defence 
mechanism against genetic aggressions (10,13,16). Within 
species, CRISPRs may be present in a subset of strains, 
where they sometimes show polymorphism. The DR and 
the order of the spacers are well conserved, but the 
number of motifs (DR þ spacer) differs from strain to 
strain. To better understand the mechanisms underlying 
the CRISPRs' evolutionary scenario, three evolution rules 
were proposed by Pourcel et al. (10) and confirmed by 
Lillestol et al. (15): (i) polarized acquisition of spacers 
near the leader sequence; (ii) random loss of motifs and 
(iii) shared ancestry when spacers are identical. 
CRISPRs' in silico analyses started in 1995 (2) but no 
specific stand-alone CRISPR software tool was created. 
Several software were used by different authors to identify 
these particular repeats but usually a manual discard 
of background was necessary, and generally some 
<rs type="software">CRISPR</rs> clusters were missed or neglected, especially the 
shortest one (less than three motifs). This is the case, for 
example, of Tandem Repeat Finder (17) when considering 
a motif (DR þ spacer) as a degenerate repeat (10,18), or 
Locating Uniform poly-Nucleotide Areas (LUNA), 
a program for finding degenerate repeats in microbial 
genomes on a desktop computer. The repeats can be 
filtered using several parameters including length, distance 
and level of conservation. LUNA was used especially for 
finding CRISPRs in archaea (4,15). Another program, 
Patscan (19) a pattern-matching tool that searches 
sequences fitting the introduced pattern, was applied to </p>

<p>identify CRISPRs containing at least three (20) or four 
exact direct repeats (8). PYGRAM (21) is a visualization 
program browsing all the repeats in the submitted 
genomic sequence and showing perfectly conserved 
palindromic repeats as pyramids. The PYGRAM pro-
gram is mostly efficient in visually displaying large 
CRISPRs (CRISPRs with as many as seven motifs are 
considered as being very short in this work) since they will 
be recognized as a concentration of horizontal bars 
referring to a group of co-occurring repeats that differ 
by only a few nucleotides. Finally, Haft et al. (12) used 
REPfind (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/reputer/), 
a part of the REPuter package (22-24) and BLASTN to 
identify smaller repeat clusters. 
These programs are the most used tools in CRISPR 
detection, although none of them is especially conceived 
for this purpose. They require further manual manipula-
tions to eliminate background data (tandem repeats for 
example) and importantly, do not define accurately the 
DR consensus (due to errors on the boundaries). Recently, 
two CRISPR-dedicated software tools were proposed, 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">CRT</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="url">http://www.room220.com/crt</rs>) and <rs type="software">PILER-CR</rs> (25). 
Both of them run fast and perform well in finding 
CRISPRs. However, CRT results in a considerable 
background since tandem repeats are considered as 
putative CRISPRs and in addition, the same CRISPR is 
sometimes detected more than once with different 
consensus DRs. PILER-CR has also some drawbacks 
since it often misidentifies the DR boundaries and omits 
the truncated DR. 
In addition, there is no user-friendly dedicated web site. 
A specialized program to automatically identify CRISPRs 
seems to be mandatory for their optimum, rapid explora-
tion and in-depth analysis, in order to increase the 
efficiency of CRISPRs investigations. CRISPRFinder is 
a web service offering fundamental tools for CRISPR 
detection, including the shortest ones, allowing an 
accurate definition of the DR consensus boundaries and 
extraction of the related spacers. It offers also additional 
tools to analyze the CRISPR loci: (i) obtain the CRISPR 
and the flanking sequences according to flexible size; 
(ii) make a blast of selected spacers or flanking sequences 
against the Genbank database and (iii) check if the DR is 
found elsewhere in prokaryotic sequenced genomes. The 
CRISPRFinder web interface is accessible through http:// 
crispr.u-psud.fr/Server/CRISPRfinder.php </p>

<p>DRs and a spacer may be considered as a maximal repeat 
where the repeated sequences are separated by a sequence 
of approximately the same length. 
The operation of the program can be divided into four 
main steps summarized in Figure 1: (Step 1) browsing the 
maximal repeats of length 23-55 bp interspaced by 
sequences of 25-60 bp, (Step 2) selecting the DR consensus 
according to a defined score taking into account the 
number of occurrences of the candidate DR in the whole 
genome and privileging internal mismatches between the 
DRs rather than mismatches in the first or the last 
nucleotides, (Step 3) defining candidate CRISPRs after 
checking if they fit CRISPR definition, (Step 4) eliminat-
ing residual tandem repeats. 
In the first step, maximal repeats are found by the 
software <rs id="software-5" type="software">Vmatch</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.vmatch.de</rs>/), the upgrade of 
REPuter (22-24). Vmatch is based on a comprehensive 
implementation of enhanced suffix arrays (27) which 
provides the power of suffix trees with lower space 
requirements. A one nucleotide mismatch is allowed 
permitting minimal CRISPRs with a single nucleotide 
mutation between DRs to be found. Hereafter, the 
obtained maximal repeats are grouped to define regions 
of possible CRISPRs with a display of consensus DR 
candidates related to each cluster. 
The second step is aimed at retrieving the DR consensus 
of each cluster. The difficulty resides especially in the 
identification of boundaries, which is very important to 
extract the correct spacers and compare DRs. In fact, 
the consensus DR is selected as the maximal repeat which 
occurs the most in the whole underlying genome sequence 
with respect to the forward and the reverse complement 
directions (since two CRISPRs having the same 
DR consensus may be in opposite directions). Thus, 
ambiguity in the choice of a DR will be eliminated in the 
case of presence of similar DRs in other CRISPRs of the 
related genomic sequence. However, if occurrence num-
bers are equal, more than a single DR consensus candidate 
are kept and later compared. Given a candidate consensus 
DR, the pattern search program fuzznuc of the EMBOSS 
package (28) is applied to get DRs' positions in the 
related cluster. As the first or the last DR in a CRISPR 
may be diverged/truncated, a mismatch of one-third of the 
DR length is allowed between the flanking DRs and the 
candidate consensus DR, whereas smaller nucleotide 
differences are allowed between the other DRs to take 
into account possible single mutations. In case of multiple 
DR candidates, a score is computed and the best one 
(minimum) is picked. This score favours candidates which 
are encountered more frequently, rather than consensus 
DR showing less internal mismatches. 
Once the DR consensus is determined, the correspond-
ing spacers (Step 3) are extracted according to the DR 
boundaries determined previously. The spacer length is 
not allowed to be shorter than 0.6 or longer than 2.5 times 
the DR length. These sizes are in the range of CRISPRs 
described in the literature. 
The last step consists in discarding false CRISPRs. 
Therefore, tandem repeats are eliminated by comparing 
the consensus DR with the spacer if there is only 
one spacer, or by comparing spacers between each other. </p>

<p>Gene structures derived from FLcDNA mapping were utilized to de-

the most reliable ORFs were determined with at least 70 amino

A pilot study of a group of educators and special-needs 
care providers (n=25) working at one of the special-
needs centers was conducted to evaluate the content 
validity of the questionnaires. The questionnaires 
were revised, and corrected according to participants' 
comments before the final draft was distributed.

statistics such as, frequency tables and percentages 
were conducted to explore the general features of 
the data. The outcome variable (dependent) was the 
dental knowledge and attitude of HCPs who advised 
preventive dental measures. Preventive dental measures 
consisted of counseling parents regarding oral hygiene, 
recommending that parents seek dental checkups, visual 
examinations of the oral cavity and teeth to explore for 
causes of dental decay, age of first dental visit, number of 
tooth brushing per day, tolls of toothbrushing, persons 
responsible regarding the child's oral hygiene, sources 
of dental knowledge, and the main cause of dental 
decay. The independent (determinant) variables were 
age, gender, education level, type of job, and specialties. 
Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to 
determine significance of variation, or the association 
at a 95% confidence level (p&lt;0.05). A cross tabulation 
analysis was conducted to analyze different categorical 
variables (responses of the participants). </p>

<p>The light source used in the FRET experiments was a mode-
locked Ti:sapphire laser (Tsunami, model 3941, Spectra-Physics) 
pumped by a 10 W diode laser (Millennia Pro, Spectra-Physics) 
and delivering ultrafast femtosecond pulses of light with a fun-
damental frequency of 80 MHz. A pulsepicker (model 3980, 
Spectra-Physics) was used to reduce the repetition rate to 2 MHz 
to satisfy the requirements of the triggering unit working at 2 
MHz. The experiments were performed at λ = 880 nm, the 
optimal wavelength to excite GFP in multiphoton mode (Chen 
and Periasamy, 2004). The power delivered at the entrance of 
the FLIM optics was 14 mW. 
All images were acquired with a ×60 oil-immersion lens 
(Plan Apo 1.4 NA, IR) mounted on an inverted microscope (Ec-
lipse TE2000E; Nikon) coupled to the FLIM system. In this 
set-up the femtosecond-pulsed laser light is scanned into the 
left camera port of the microscope through the FLIM optics. 
The fluorescence emission is directed back into the detection 
unit through the same camera port and a short-pass filter (λ &lt; 
750 nm). The FLIM unit was composed of two galvano mirrors, 
scanning along the x and y axes, a relay lens to focus the laser 
beam on to the dichroic (with a cut-off at 750 nm), and the streak 
camera (Streakscope C4334, Hamamatsu Photonics) coupled to 
a fast and high-sensitivity CCD (charge-coupled device) camera 
(model C8800-53C, Hamamatsu Photonics). The streak cam-
era consisted of a photocathode surface, a sweep electrode to 
deflect the photoelectrons according to their arrival time, an 
MCP-PMT (microchannel plate-photomultiplier tube) to amp-
lify photoelectrons and a phosphor screen to detect the amplified 
photoelectrons. The images on the phosphor screen were read-
out by the CCD camera (for a comprehensive description of the 
streak-FLIM system, see Krishnan et al., 2003). The images were 
acquired with a lateral resolution of 0.246 nm. For each y posi-
tion in the object, an (x,t) image was produced by recording the 
fluorescence decay during a given time interval (full timescale of 
10 ns with a temporal resolution of 60 ps). Scanning the entire 
optical image in the y-direction results in a stack of (x,t) images 
from which fluorescence decays at each (x,y) position can be ex-
tracted. The intensity image of the object plane was obtained by 
integrating fluorescence intensities over time. The CCD camera 
gain was set to 0 to minimize electronic noise. The MCP-PMT 
gain (6−8) and the exposure time of the CCD (100 ms) were 
adjusted to avoid overexposure of the CCD (max value of 4096 
grey levels). Frame accumulation (up to 20 frames) was used to 
increase the signal/noise ratio. The total acquisition time per 
image ranged from 60 to 80 s (imaging field of 15 μm). 
For each image, average fluorescence decay profiles were calcu-
lated in the region of interest corresponding to the centrosome (4 
or 6 pixels). Then, lifetimes were estimated by fitting these res-
ults with a mono-exponential function using a non-linear least-
squares estimation procedure with <rs id="software-2" type="software">Origin</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">7.5</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Origin- Lab, Northampton, MA, U.S.A</rs>.) or the profile fitting function

were reported and Chi-square tests were used to determine

Following initial comparisons, generalized linear models 
(GLMs) were used, which test whether the adjusted (accounting

<p>Steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured using 
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) assays. Reactions at 
37 
C contained 30 mM MES (pH 6.2), 6 mM MgCl 2 , 
30 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mg/ml BSA in a final 
volume of 50 ml. The monovalent salt concentration was 
increased to 80 mM in certain reactions by the addition of 
50 mM NaCl. In addition the reaction mixtures contained 
2.0 mM wild-type or mutant Rad51 protein and 12 mM 
uX174 ssDNA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 
a-[ 
32 P]-ATP to a final concentration of 3 mM (10 mCi/ml 
final specific activity). Aliquots (8 ml) were removed at 
various time points and quenched with 8 mM EDTA 
and 1% SDS (final concentrations). Quenched samples 
were spotted out at 1 ml volume onto PEI-cellulose TLC 
plates (20 Â 20 cm) at 1-cm intervals. After all the samples 
were spotted and dried the TLC plates were developed 
with 0.75 M KH 2 PO 4 and allowed to air dry. The TLC 
plates were exposed for 1.5 h to a K-screen (Kodak) and 
scanned by a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager-FX.

best approximation to the homoscedastic assumption. The three system 
outputs were (i) measurement of linezolid concentration-time profiles in

nonfederal awards) for all pay periods and for 
all individuals. The data also include the federal 
funding agency and job titles, which we mapped 
into six occupation categories that include fac-
ulty and graduate student. These data identify all 
people employed on research projects and their 
positions. The focal award is identified based on 
the time on the award and the award's share of 
the student's earnings. 
PhD recipients ("graduate students" includes 
Masters students) are identified by matching 
UMETRICS data to ProQuest's Dissertation and 
Thesis Database. These data contain the name of 
the dissertation's author, the subject (which we 
aggregated manually), institution awarding the 
degree, and the degree awarded. 
We link the UMETRICS data to the 2010 
census via a person identifier, used internally 
by the Census Bureau, called the Protected 
Identification Key (PIK). PIKs are assigned 
through the Person Identification Validation 
System (<rs type="software">PVS</rs>), which uses probability record 
linkage techniques and personal information 
such as name, date of birth, and residential loca-
tion (Wagner and Layne 2014). Once a PIK is 
assigned to a record, the Personally Identifiable 
Information is removed so analysts can anony-
mously link individuals across files for statisti-
cal and research purposes. Person records in the 
census contain date of birth, gender, race, eth-
nicity, and relationship to the head of household 
(HH), the last of which permits inference about 
certain relationships within a household. Marital 
status is modeled for graduate students who are 
either the HH or listed as a spouse or unmarried 
partner of the HH. Individuals are characterized 
as having children when they are, or are married 
to, the HH and there are (step) children of the 
HH present. </p>

<p>Massachusetts, USA). A nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium 
telluride detector and an attenuated total reflection cell, 
Harric BioATRcell 
II , with a silicon crystal were used. The 
temperature of the attenuated total reflection cell was 30°C. 
Spectra were recorded using <rs id="software-0" type="software">OPUS</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 7.2</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Bruker</rs>, Massachusetts, USA). Gastric aspirate (20 lL) was 
transferred to a fresh vial containing 20 lL of internal 
standard (potassium thiocyanate 1 g/L). Then, 6 lL of this 
mixture was applied to the attenuated total reflection 
crystal. The sample was dried for two minutes under a 
gentle stream of air (40-45°C). Each sample was applied 
twice, and for each application, two spectra were recorded. 
The mean value of the four spectra was calculated, and 
the baseline was corrected and normalised with respect to 
the potassium thiocyanate peak at 2.000-2.110 cm </p>

<p>was removed by rinsing with 2.0 mL 5.25 % NaOCl using a 
30-gauge irrigation needle, before adding solvent and using 
sequentially smaller diameter files to remove gutta percha 
using a reaming motion. The endpoint of instrumentation 
was determined when a #30 K-file reached the working 
length. The total time required to remove the filling material 
was 5 minutes. 
Apical patency was ensured with #10 K-file before final 
irrigation with 10 mL of citric acid and 10 mL with 5.25% 
NaOCl. All canals were then dried with paper points. 
Longitudinal grooves were prepared on the external 
surface of all roots before splitting the samples into two 
halves. One half of each sample was mounted on an SEM 
specimen holder before placement in a vacuum chamber 
and coating with a 20-nm thick gold-palladium layer. 
Microscopic analyses were done using a scanning electron 
microscope (DSM940, ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany). SEM 
images were obtained with an acceleration tension of 20kV, 
in modes of secondary (SE) and back-scattered (BSE) 
electrons. All sample preparation procedures were performed 
by the same operator. 
For evaluation purposes, each specimen was divided 
into cervical, middle and apical thirds. A single evaluator, 
who was blinded to the specimen location, examined only 
the central region of the middle and apical thirds. SEM 
micrographs of the center of the middle and apical third 
regions were taken at X500 magnification that corresponded 
to an area of 367.2 µm 
2. The number of open dentinal tubules 
per area unit was quantified using <rs id="software-1" type="software">image Pro Plus</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">4.5</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Media Cybernetics</rs>, Silver Spring, MD, USA). The number 
of dentinal tubules free of filling materials per mm2 was 
statistically evaluated by Kruskall-Wallis test (p&lt;0.05). </p>

<p>Measures of organisational network analysis will be used to provide 
information about which organisations are linked, the number of links in the 
network, the types of interactions between organisations (eg, exchanging 
information, referrals and planning), and the level and strength of each 
relationship. 
34 35 Maps displaying the patterns of connections between 
organisations will be generated utilising the <rs type="software">UCINET</rs> software. 
36 The visual 
and detailed nature of organisational network maps serves as a powerful 
heuristic device for discussion about the structure of the network, about which 
services are linked and on which activities. See online supplementary 
appendix 2 for a hypothetical map. </p>

<p>Framework analysis will be used to explore the present linkage strategies and 
management gaps, barriers and enablers between mental health, aged care, 
primary care and social care services, and how these affect people's help 
seeking experience and journey. Framework analysis is a qualitative method 
that is suited to applied research with specific questions, a limited timeframe, 
a predesigned sample, and a priori issues that are to be explored. 
38 The 
<rs type="software">NVivo</rs> software package will be used to manage and assist analysis of the 
qualitative data. </p>

<p>RNA extraction and quantitative (q)PCR. Total RNA was extracted 
from gastric cancer cells using TRIzol 
® reagent (Invitrogen; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's 
protocol. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using an 
RT-PCR kit. qPCR was performed on a StepOnePlus Real-Time 
PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) using the THUN-
DERBIRD 
® SYBR 
® qPCR Mix. The qPCR consisted of 35 cycles 
of 94˚C for 30 sec, 56˚C for 30 sec and 72˚C for 30 sec. ER-α36 
and β-actin primers were designed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Primer Premier</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">5.0</rs> 
software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Premier Biosoft International</rs>, Palo Alto, CA, USA),

<p>Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed 
using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">12.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS, Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). 
Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three 
replicate samples, and differences were compared using the 
Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance. P&lt;0.05 was 
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. All 
experiments were performed at least three times to ensure the 
reproducibility of the results. </p>

<p>Per-protocol analysis was conducted to evaluate the treatment 
effect. The baseline characteristics were presented as absolute 
number (percentage) or mean (standard deviation). To compare 
baseline characteristics between groups, the Mann-Whitney U 
test was used for continuous variables and Fisher exact test for 
categorical variables. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to 
compare differences between pre-and posttraining outcomes 
within each group. Changes from baseline of each outcome 
measure between groups were compared using linear regression 
analysis. A 2-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered 
significant. All statistical analyses were performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> 
software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 14.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL). </p>

<p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize both categorical 
data (frequencies and percentages) and continuous data 
(means and standard deviations). Post hoc Bonferroni tests 
and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
Greenhouse-Geisser correction were used to assess the signif-
icance of the differences between the numbers of chronic dis-
ease medication classes taken before, during. and after che-
motherapy. All of the data analysis was performed using the 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</rs> program (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version16.0</rs>). </p>

<p>The Icelandic samples. A total of 2,986 Icelandic adults, recruited through 
cardiovascular, neoplastic, neurological and metabolic studies, were genotyped 
for 317,511 SNPs using the <rs id="software-8" type="software">HumanHap300 BeadChip</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Illumina</rs>). These studies 
were approved by the Data Protection Commission of Iceland and the National 
Bioethics Committee of Iceland. Written informed consent was obtained from 
all participants. Personal identifiers associated with phenotypic information </p>

<p>Single SNP and microsatellite genotyping. SNP genotyping was carried out 
using the <rs id="software-10" type="software">Centaurus</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">Nanogen</rs>) platform 43 in (Supplementary Table 7 online). 
The quality of each Centaurus SNP assay was evaluated by genotyping each 
assay in the CEU and/or YRI HapMap samples and comparing the results with 
the HapMap data. Assays with mismatch rates of 41.5% were not used, and an 
LD test was used for markers known to be in LD. </p>

<p>Controlling for population stratification. Most of the variants that show 
significant association with pigmentation are also present in frequencies that 
differ among European populations and between European, Asian and African 
populations. These frequency differences are to be expected given the differ-
ences in pigmentation between the populations. However, if our method of 
discovery were applied to a stratified sample of Europeans, without taking this 
stratification into account, then variants with population frequencies that 
correlate with pigmentation could show spurious association with pigmenta-
tion. We therefore carried out a series of tests to search for signs of stratifica-
tion, even though the Icelandic population has been relatively isolated 
throughout its history. 
First, we applied the method of genomic control to the analysis, which takes 
into account the genome-wide inflation of the w 2 statistics. The inflation factors 
we observed were similar to inflation factors estimated from known relation-
ships between individuals, which suggests that the overall inflation due to 
stratification is small (Supplementary Table 6). 
Second, from a published set of 400 SNPs known to have differing 
frequencies between European poulations 44 , we selected a subset of 97 SNPs 
that are also present on the Illumina 317K Human Hap chip. We then tested for 
LD between 4,417 pairs of markers on different chromosomes among 1,984 
Icelanders who are unrelated to a meiotic distance of 3. Of the 4,417 pairs 
tested, 225 had P o 0.05, compared with 220.8 expected, and 6 had P o 0.001, 
compared with 4.4 expected. We also tested for LD between the 97 SNPs and 
the 9 SNPs, resulting in 834 tests in which the two markers were not on the 
same chromosome. Again we observed no significant excess of low P values (39 
observed compared with 41 expected at P o 0.05 and 2 observed compared 
with 0.8 expected at P o 0.001). 
Third, the gene encoding lactase is well described and has a large degree of 
variation between populations 45 , but no known association with pigmentation. 
We chose the intragenic marker rs2322659 and tested its LD with the nine 
SNPs that are associated with pigmentation (P 4 0.01 in all instances). We also 
carried out six tests for association of rs2322659 with pigmentation without 
detecting any significant association. 
Finally, we applied the <rs type="software">EIGENSTRAT</rs> method 46 , which relies on patterns of 
correlation between individuals to detect stratification, to our Icelandic 
discovery sample. No evidence of substantial stratification was detected, 
with the largest principal component estimated to explain 0.2% of the 
overall variation of the data. The correction factors based on correcting for 
the ten largest principal components are close to 1 (Supplementary Table 8 </p>

<p>Figure 1. Computational analysis of PDE12. (A) The unrooted classification tree of human EEP proteins. The sequences of the catalytic domain of 
all human proteins of the EEP family (PF03372) were extracted from the Pfam database (see Supplementary Table S1 for details) and aligned using 
ClustalW2. Five major subgroups identified are indicated on the tree: inositol phosphatases (orange), Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases (grey), 
Endo-and exonucleases (green), DNase I-like proteins (blue) and Deadenylases (red). (B) Domain architecture of confirmed and putative human 
deadenylases of the EEP family. Functional domains of human proteins of the 'Deadenylases' subgroup identified in (A) are schematically repre-
sented. The position of the EEP domain is represented in each protein by a red box containing the percentage of identity between this domain and 
that of PDE12. (C and D) Comparison of the active site structure of PDE12 and other EEP deadenylases. The active site structural motif of PDE12

PDE12 protein was detected using anti-Flag antibody; anti-VDAC-1 antibodies were used as a mitochondrial loading control. (B) Analysis of the 
poly(A) tail length of mitochondrial transcripts upon PDE12 induction. Mitochondrial ND1 or CO2 mRNAs were analysed by cRT-PCR and 
sequencing as described in 'Materials and Methods' section. Each data point represents a single clone analysed for the HEK293T parental cells 
(triangle), wild-type PDE12 (circle) and the E351A mutant (square). The length of poly(A) extensions are given on the Y-axis (note that the values 
below zero indicate transcripts that were truncated beyond the processing/polyadenylation site). Doxycycline induction times are given on the X-axis. 
The horizontal lines represent average lengths of poly(A) tails. (C) Northern blots of mitochondrial transcripts upon overexpression of PDE12. Total

<p>women of childbearing potential were excluded. Treatment 
with strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9, which 
have a narrow therapeutic index, was prohibited during the 
study. All patients provided written informed consent before 
enrolment. The study followed the ethical principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on 
Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and was 
approved by the institutional review board. 
Safety evaluations. Safety was assessed according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 
3.0. 
(12) Assessments included regular laboratory evaluations, 
physical examinations, vital signs, weight, and periodic elec-
trocardiogram recordings. In order to be considered a DLT by 
protocol, the toxicity must have occurred during pharmacoki-
netic run-in and the first 28-day cycle of sonidegib treatment. 
Pharmacokinetics. For the pharmacokinetic run-in period, 
serial blood samples were collected starting on day 1 (ending 
on day 7) at predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 
168 h post-dose. Serial blood samples were also collected on 
day 15 of cycle 1 at predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h 
post-dose. Furthermore, blood samples at predose were col-
lected on days 8 and 22 of cycle 1; days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of 
cycle 2; and day 1 of all subsequent cycles. Sonidegib concen-
trations in plasma were measured using a validated liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method 
(7) with the 
lower limit of quantification of 25.4 pg/mL. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were estimated for each patient using a non-com-
partmental method with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Phoenix WinNonlin</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Pharsight</rs>, Moun-
tain View, CA, USA) using a linear trapezoidal method for 
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) calculation. 
Biomarker and antitumor evaluations. Normal skin samples 
were collected from all patients before sonidegib treatment, at 
the end of cycle 1, and within 14 days after the last treatment. 
Ribonucleic acid was extracted from tissue samples and ana-
lyzed by RT-PCR 
(6,13) to estimate GLI1 expression and Hh 
pathway activation status. 
Tumor response was evaluated by investigators' judgment 
on the results of computed tomography or MRI according to 
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0. </p>

<p>The present study consisted of 16 elite Korean wrestling athletes and 95 nonathletes. Measurements were performed from 
March 2015 to August 2015. One hundred and eleven volunteers who had no abnormal physical or psychological conditions 
provided written informed consent to participation in this study 9) . Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire via 
individual in-depth interviews, which took 30 minutes per person 9) . There were seven weight categories: gyungjang (less 
than 75 kg), sojang (less than 80 kg), chungjang (less than 85 kg), yongjang (less than 90 kg), yongsa (less than 95 kg), 
yeoksa (less than 110 kg), and jangsa (less than 150 kg) 9, 10) . The criteria for the inclusion of participants in the study were 
as follows: (1) 20-23 years of age, (2) male, (3) history of respiratory disease, (4) experience of stress during exercise, (5) 
psychological factors, (6) history of injuries, and (7) primary technology used. Before measurement, all participants rested 
for 30 minutes 9) . Chest and abdominal circumference were measured at rest under expiratory and inspiratory conditions 2) . 
Chest circumference was measured at the height of the axilla, and abdominal circumference was measured at the height of 
the navel. The respiration ability of participants was measured. The participants were measured by lung function testing using 
the SCHILLER SP-260 spirometer (SCHILLER AG, Baar, Switzerland). Spirometric parameters, including forced vital 
capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow (PEF), peak inspiratory 
flow (PIF), slow vital capacity (SVC), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), tidal volume 
(TV), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), minute or expired ventilation (MV), and respiratory rate (RR) were recorded 
and analyzed by methods of resting breathing and forced breathing. Measurement was focused on the FVC graph, which 
was divided into the expiratory area (ExA) and the inspiratory area (InsA) 2) . The pixel values were measured using <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Adobe</rs> 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Photoshop</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">7.0.1</rs>. The ExA was divided into A and B sections based on the PEF. Analogously, the InsA was divided into C and 
D sections based on the PIF. Each A, B, C, and D section was further subdivided to four areas (Fig. 1A). From left to right, 
the connections between each of the divided points of the A area were designated as the first slope (AS1), the second slope 
(AS2), and the third slope (AS3). Correspondingly, from left to right, the first, second, and third slopes defining the B area 
were designated BS1, BS2, and BS3, respectively; the first, second, and third slopes defining the C area were designated CS1, 
CS2, and CS3, respectively; and the first, second, and third slopes defining the D area were designated DS1, DS2, and DS3, 
respectively (Fig. 1A) 2) . After creating these subdivisions, the tangent and angle of each point were measured. The angle of 
each point and the respiratory area of the FVC were each measured in triplicate at each measurement time, and the mean 
values were calculated 2, 19) . The formula for the tangent is given in Equation 1, where r is the radius of a circle composed of 
the coordinates of the x and y axes. The cos θ is the value obtained by dividing x by r; sin θ is the value obtained by dividing 
y by r. The tan θ is equivalent to the ratio of the sin θ to the cos θ 2, 20) . </p>

The significance level was set to α=0.05, and all data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of the measurements. 
One-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the significance between the groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient test 
was performed to identify correlations between the variables. The protocol for this study was approved by the Committee of

<p>Laboratory analysis 
A fasting blood sample was collected at 
weeks 0, 4, and 16. All samples were 
processed and stored at 2808C within 2 h 
of collection. All laboratory analyses were 
blinded. Plasma ascorbic acid concentra-
tions were determined according to the 
method described by Vuilleumier and 
Keck (20). Serum concentrations of 
lutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin, 
a-carotene, b-carotene, and lycopene 
were measured by high-performance liq-
uid chromatography with diode array de-
tection, as described by Craft et al. (21). 
Assays were standardized against appropri-
ate National Institute of Standards and 
Technology control materials. The fasting 
serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, 
and triglycerides) was assessed using enzy-
matic colorimetric assays (Roche Diagnos-
tics Limited, West Sussex, U.K.) on the 
ILab-600 biochemical analyzer (Instru-
mentation Laboratory, Warrington, U.K.). 
LDL cholesterol was calculated using a 
standard Friedewald equation (22). Plasma 
adiponectin (total, high-molecular weight, 
medium-molecular weight, and low-
molecular weight) were measured by 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">ELISA</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">ALPCO</rs> diagnostics); low-molecular 
weight adiponectin was obtained by sub-
tracting the combined concentration of 
medium-molecular weight and high-
molecular weight adiponectin (measured 
directly) from the total adiponectin con-
centration. Serum insulin levels were mea-
sured by <rs id="software-1" type="software">ELISA</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Abbot IMx</rs>; Abbott 
Laboratories, Berkshire, U.K.). Plasma 
glucose levels were measured using an au-
tomated glucose oxidase method using a 
Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2. Fasting glu-
cose and insulin levels were used to calcu-
late the HOMA score (23). Commercial 
kits were used to measure C-peptide 
(Dako UK Ltd, Ely, U.K.) and nonesterified 
fatty acids (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, 
Germany) on the ILab-600 biochemical 
analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory). </p>

<p>Statistical methods 
All statistical analyses were carried out 
using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> for Windows <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 17.0</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SPSS, Inc</rs>, Chicago, IL). Normally dis-
tributed continuous variables were sum-
marized using the mean and SD. Skewed 
variables were log-transformed for para-
metric analysis and summarized using the 
geometric mean and interquartile range. 
A one-way ANOVA test, or x 
2 test, was 
used to compare the three groups at base-
line for continuous and categorical varia-
bles, respectively. One-way ANOVA with 
linear trend test was used to examine dif-
ferences in mean change (i.e., preinter-
vention value minus postintervention 
value for a given continuous variable) be-
tween groups for the primary and second-
ary end points. Post hoc analyses were 
performed using the Dunnett test com-
paring the control group (one to two por-
tions) with the intervention groups (four 
and seven portions). For each variable, 
intervention analysis was performed for 
all participants who had completed the 
study protocol according to randomiza-
tion group. The test for linear trend 
(with changes in variable and portion al-
location as the dependent and indepen-
dent variables, respectively), analogous to 
linear regression, was incorporated in or-
der to take account of the dose-response 
design. Variables that were not normally

these analyses. A sample size of 30 patients

detect a 10% difference in GIR between 
groups at a 5% level of significance (15,16). </p>

<p>The results of standardization of the

reliability and validity. The analyses were done 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 6.0</rs>. 
Reliability Measures : Three measures of 
reliability were calculated, as follows: Cronbach's 
Alpha, a measure of internal consistency, 
calculated for the whole sample (N=155, data 
for 2 cases missing) separately for Section-I and 
Section-ll, was 0.9 and 0.67 respectively. Inter-
rater reliability of 3 raters for 9 families was 
computed. The intra-class correlation co-efficient 
(ICC) for any single rater was 0.81 and average 
reliability for all 3 raters was 0.93, indicating good 
inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was 
calculated for a sub-sample of families who were 
evaluated at intake and again after a mean 
duration of 4.5 months (N=110). Pearson's Yfor 
Section-I was 0.71 (p&lt;.01) and for Section-ll was 
0.36 (p&lt;.01), indicating moderate to high test-
retest reliability. </p>

<p>Original research papers investigating the plastic sur-
geons, otolaryngologists and maxillofacial surgeons in ap-
proaching the complicated issue of auricular reconstruc-
tion published from January 1995 to December 2014 were 
aggregated, coded, and used in the current study. The fol-
lowing libraries and online sources were searched: PubMed, 
MEDLINE, Wiley, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus. 
The terminologies that were used to identify these ar-
ticles included: plastic surgery, auricular defects, recon-
structions, ear trauma, bioengineering, facial surgery. The 
articles obtained from different databases into the bib-
liographic software package <rs type="software">EndNote</rs> were imported and 
merged into one complete database. Two review authors 
independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all ar-
ticles found by the searching method outlined above. </p>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">statistical 
program for social sciences</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). 
Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-squared test 
and Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Continues variables 
were analyzed using Student's t-test. Binary logistic regres-
sion analysis was performed to identify the independent 
predictors of HBV reactivation. A P-value of ,0.05 was 
considered statically significant. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
All analyses were performed with <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 18.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., 
Chicago, IL, USA). All data are expressed as mean±standard 
deviation for continuous variables and as percentage ratio for 
categorical variables. Categorical variables were compared by chi-
square test. If more than 20% of cells had a count less than five in 
the chi-square test, a Fisher's exact test was performed. Continuous 
variables were compared by Student t tests. If the data did not show 
a normal distribution, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed. A p 
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>30 using this measure, and used it as their primary outcome 
measure. Direct and indirect comparisons among the four 
treatments were made without an NMA approach. The binary 
outcome data from 20 of these two-arm studies were avail-
able, and the resulting network is shown in Figure 1. 
The network plot reveals an unequal number of studies 
per comparison and the absence of direct evidence between 
some of the pairs of treatments (eg, hyster and Mirena). An 
NMA synthesizing all evidence simultaneously was not 
conducted and rank probabilities were not estimated. 
Using the available raw data (from the identified studies), 
a Bayesian NMA was performed for the purpose of yield-
ing probabilistic conclusions. It was possible to determine 
estimates for both relative effect sizes and rank probabilities 
through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation 
sampling using an R package called <rs type="software">gemtc</rs>. The pairwise 
estimates are available in Table 1. Based on this table, 
hysterectomy is the treatment yielding the greatest reduc-
tion of patients' dissatisfaction regarding heavy menstrual 
bleeding, with the remaining three treatments relatively 
indistinguishable. These estimates are very similar to their 
findings despite the methods applied. 
The rank probabilities of the four treatments are pro-
vided in Table 2. This ranking supports the conclusion that 
hysterectomy is the most effective treatment. However, when 
working with real data, there is no way to know if any bias is 
present in the findings. This paper will consider what factors </p>

<p>EDTA, 1% CHAPSO, protease inhibitor mixture). Isolates of the 
membrane fraction (800 g) were diluted in 1 ml of buffer B to a 
final concentration of 0.5% CHAPSO. After preclearing with pro-
tein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C, lysates 
were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate anti-
body (a mouse monoclonal anti-A␤ 6E10 (from Covance) or a 
mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (from Sigma) antibodies). Immu-
noprecipitants were recovered by overnight incubation at 4°C 
with protein G-Sepharose. Beads were washed 3 times with radio-
immune precipitation assay buffer or buffer B (0.5% CHAPSO) 
and once with phosphate-buffered saline. 
SDS/PAGE and Western Blot Analyses-Whole cell lysates 
(total protein 50 g), membrane lysates (protein 25-50 g), and 
immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in SDS sample 
buffer, separated on Tris-Tricine gels 16% or Tris-glycine gels 
4 -20% (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. 
Target proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence 
(ECL Amersham Biosciences) with the following antibodies: 
mouse monoclonal anti-A␤ 6E10 (Covance), anti-A␤ 4G8 
(Covance), rabbit polyclonal anti-PS1-NTF, anti-NCT-Nt, anti-
FLAG (from Sigma), and anti-APP CTF antibodies. 
Peptide Synthesis and Assays-The TMP21 transmembrane 
domain sequence containing three N-and C-terminal lysine 
residues (KKK-VLYFSIFSMFCLIGLATWQVFYL-KKK) and 
the p24a transmembrane domain (KKK-VVLWSFFEALVL-
VAMTLGQIYYL-KKK) peptides were synthesized by standard 
Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based solid phase 
methodology. The terminal lysines were added to increase pep-
tide solubility. Peptides were purified by reverse phase high 
pressure liquid chromatography using water/acetonitrile mix-
tures buffered with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a POROS 20R2 
column. Stock solutions of both peptides were prepared in 
DMSO and added at the desired final concentrations (10 and 30 
g/ml) to the media of cultures of HEK293 cells stably express-
ing the Swedish variant of APP. Media was collected at different 
time points and A␤40 levels were determined by ELISA. 
A␤40 ELISA and Cell-free Assays-A␤40 levels were meas-
ured by ELISA assays using conditioned medium collected 
from HEK293 cells after a transient transfection or a treatment 
with synthetic peptide (TM-TMP21, TM-p24). The enzyme-
linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA was performed according 
to the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE. Determination 
of ␥-secretase activity by cell-free assay was as previously described 
(26). Briefly, membrane fractions were isolated from HEK293 cells 
and incubated with recombinant FLAG-tagged APP-C100. 
TMP21 and p24a synthetic peptides solubilized in DMSO were 
added to the reaction mixture at the desired concentrations and 
A␤40 generated by proteolysis was measured by ELISA.

ue. The model was determined when all the variables were 
presented with a significance level less than 5% (P&lt;0.05). 
The dependent variable used was the peak VO 2 
[1,2,5] . After the 
analysis, we established an equation with variables associat-
ed with peak VO 2 . 
For all statistical analyzes, we used <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> (Chicago IL,

<p>Physiological measurements 
All participants were instructed not to exercise ex-
cessively and to refrain from caffeinated beverages, alco-
holic beverages, and smoking for 3 hours before the psy-
chophysiological measurements were collected. A lead II 
electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected for 5 minutes at 
baseline using the <rs id="software-3" type="software">ProComp Infiniti</rs> 
TM system (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Thought Technology Ltd.</rs>., Montreal, Canada), which was installed 
on a laptop. A sampling rate of 2,048/second was set in or-
der to acquire real-time interbeat intervals. The physio-
logical signals were collected between 9:00 to 12:00 a.m. 
and 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. to minimize any effects of biological </p>

<p>Psychophysiological measurement 
The demographic data and information related to her-
oin use, including the history of substance use, the age of 
onset of heroin use, and the number of times the partic-
ipants had tried previously to quit heroin use, were col-
lected among heroin users. The BDI-II total score and 
cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression were ob-
tained at pre-intervention and post-intervention from all 
participants. The HRV-BF was carried out using <rs type="software">ProComp 
Infiniti</rs> 
TM software together with ECG and respiration sen-
sors, which were used to acquire real-time feedback re-
garding respiration rate, breathing patterns, RSA ampli-
tude, and HRV indices. The HRV indices as the outcome 
variables were obtained at pre-intervention and at post-
intervention. </p>

<p>Study 1 
The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Mann-
Whitney U post-hoc comparisons were used to examine 
the group differences in age, total score, and cognitive/so-
matic symptoms of depression, and HRV indices across 
the three groups. Spearman's rank correlations were used 
to examine the association between depression total 
scores and HRV indices. The statistical analyses were per-
formed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">PASW</rs> Statistics <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">ver. 18.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">IBM Co.</rs>.,

<p>As a result, 300-430 virtual slices were analyzed. The 
number of slices depends on the length of the bone samples. 
The CT slice images were produced using commercial soft-
ware <rs id="software-0" type="software">Octopus</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 8.4</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">inCT Co.</rs>., Aalst, Belgium) which 
implements an ordinary filtered back projection algorithm. 
The resulting images are a map of the local X-ray attenua-
tion coefficient plus the enhanced boundaries made by the 
interference of transmitting coherent X-rays. In the images, 
the newly formed bone fragments were clearly distinguished 
from the Bio-Oss 
® in the gray level. Image analysis software 
(<rs id="software-1" type="software">Amira</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">Version 5.5</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">FEI Co.</rs>., Hillsboro, OR, USA) was used 
for 3D visualization. The slice images were noise filtered and 
then smoothed using the edge-preserving-smoothing func-
tion of the software. Segmentation was carried out based on 
the difference in the gray level between the Bio-Oss 
® and 
the newly formed bone and the volume was calculated by 
counting the number of voxels belonging to each material. At 
each slice, the measurements were performed to calculate the 
percentage (ie, area fraction) of mineralized bone, residual 
graft material, and soft tissue components.

<p>Preventability was evaluated based on three categories 
[18]: (1) Preventable-the drug-related ED visit was the 
result of misuse of a drug, inappropriate discontinuation of 
treatment, non-adherence, or self-medication; (2) Possibly 
preventable-the visit was due to failure to monitor drug 
therapy or an error in prescribing, dispensing, or adminis-
tration; or (3) Not preventable-the ADE occurred during 
compliance with good drug utilization. 
The severity of drug-related ED visits was classified 
according to the following criteria [19]: (1) Mild-a lab-
oratory abnormality or the symptom did not require drug 
intervention, (2) Moderate-a laboratory abnormality or 
symptom that required drug intervention at the ED, (3) 
Severe-the symptom required hospital admission, was 
life-threatening, or resulted in permanent disability. 
The outcome of the drug-related ED visit was categorized 
into three groups: (1) discharged immediately after consulta-
tion with the ED physician, (2) admitted to the ED-observa-
tion ward for a maximum of 72 h, and (3) admitted to a 
hospital ward through the ED. Drug classification was per-
formed according to <rs id="software-3" type="software">MIMS</rs>.com Malaysia <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">version 1.3.0</rs> [20]. </p>

<p>Data were analyzed using statistical software (SPSS ver-
sion 21, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). The prevalence of 
ADE-related ED visits was calculated by dividing the 
number of patients with ADE-related ED visits by the total 
sample size. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic, 
clinical, and drug-related variables was conducted. Results 
were presented as frequency (percentage) for categorical 
variables and mean (standard deviation [SD]) for numerical 
variables. The Chi squared goodness-of-fit test was used to 
determine the distribution of cases in a single categorical 
variable at a 0.05 significance (alpha) level. </p>

<p>
with the busy and overcrowded nature of some public 
hospitals in Malaysia, which may not allow adequate 
patient counseling, especially regarding medication 
adherence [45, 46]. Medication non-adherence has become 
a silent burden of healthcare [39, 44, 47]; thus, many 
intervention measures have been made to improve adher-
ence to increase patient safety. Such interventions include 
patient education via verbal and written instructions, 
illustrations, and audiovisuals by healthcare providers, and 
reminders such as medication calendars, medication 
schedule alerts, stickers, box alarms, and pill timers. In 
Malaysia, efforts have been made to improve medication 
adherence, including the use of short message alerts, called 
<rs type="software">MySMS</rs> 
Ò , in some hospitals [48] and the establishment of 
Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) services 
operated by pharmacists in some public hospitals. These 
services have resulted in significant improvements in 
medication adherence [49]. Studies have shown that 
pharmacist interventions have played a major role in 
improving medication adherence, especially among 
patients with chronic illness. The pharmacist is an expert 
on drugs and has the skills and expertise to improve 
medication adherence and potentially minimize the 
prevalence of DTF-related ED visits [50, 51]. More inter-
vention measures are needed to improve medication 
adherence. 
In the current study, ADRs account for one-third of the 
ADE-related ED visits. This rate is consistent with similar 
studies conducted in India [52] and in hospital wards in 
Malaysia and Germany [33, 38]. Hypoglycemia was the 
most common complaint associated with ADRs, mainly 
related to antidiabetic therapy (gliclazide and insulin). The 
high rate of ADRs in the current study may be explained by 
the poor ADR monitoring and reporting system in 
Malaysia. Despite the establishment of the Malaysian 
Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (MADRAC) 
in 1987 to receive and monitor ADR reporting, the 
response is still very low compared with other countries 
[53]. Reports have identified some of the factors associated 
with under-reporting of ADRs in Malaysia, including (1) 
lack of awareness on the importance of and the need for 
ADR monitoring and reporting, (2) uncertainty about 
whether or not the event was an ADR, (3) opinion that the 
reaction was too trivial or well known to report, (4) lack of 
knowledge on how to report, and (5) inadequate time for 
reporting [54]. If ADRs are not reported, then, predictably, 
the extent of the occurrence, the people at risk, and the 
drugs involved will not be well known. As such, preventive 
interventions will be hampered, leading to increasing 
numbers of ADRs. Another reason for the high ADR 
prevalence rate in our study may be related to the current 
treatment guidelines for DM and the poor glycemic control </p>

<p>bounded by 3 and 6 mm concentric circles, were constructed 
using the automated software algorithm. Central subfield 
thickness was defined as the average thickness in the central 1 
mm subfield centered on the fovea. Average macular thickness, 
foveal thickness, outer macular (superior, nasal, inferior, and 
temporal) thicknesses, and macular volume were obtained for 
each eye. The GCA algorithm was incorporated into the newer 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">Cirrus OCT</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 6.5</rs> with the annulus of inner 
vertical and horizontal diameters of 1 and 1.2 mm, respectively, 
and outer vertical and horizontal diameters of 4 and 4.8 mm, 
respectively. As reported, 
[27] the outer ring size includes the area 
where the GCL is thickest in a healthy eye. The GCA algorithm 
identifies the outer boundaries of RNFL and IPL, between which 
is the GCIPL layer. GCIPLT will be analyzed according to 8 
parameters-average, minimum, and 6 sectors (superonasal, 
superior, superotemporal, inferotemporal, inferior, and infer-
onasal)-by the GCA algorithm embedded in Cirrus OCT. 
Grayscale images were used for a more precise identification and 
measurement of the EZ. Length was measured in the horizontal 
and vertical scans, and an average value was obtained. Outer 
retinal thickness (ORT) was defined as the region from the outer 
plexiform layer to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer/ 
Bruch complex, consisting of the outer plexiform layer, outer 
nuclear layer, extend limiting membrane (ELM), myoid zone, EZ, 
interdigitation zone, and RPE/Bruch complex. ORT was 
measured 1 mm from the fovea in the horizontal and vertical 
scans, and an average value was obtained. 
To measure RNFL thickness, 200 Â 200 axial scans were used 
in a 6 Â 6 mm 
2 area around the optic disc cube. The software 
automatically detected the center of the optic disc and extracted a 
3.46-mm-diameter peripapillary circle to calculate RNFL 
thickness at each point of the circle. Four-quadrant thickness 
and global 360°average thickness provided by Cirrus OCT were 
used in the study, and the correlation between GCIPL and 
papillary RNFL thicknesses was analyzed. 
CFT and GCIPLT were classified into 3 grades according to the 
statistical percentile (33.3% and 66.6%). EZ appearance in the 
OCT images was graded from 1 to 3 as follows: Grade 1, 
shortened EZ (obtained from cross-section of 6 mm horizontal 
and vertical scans) more than 1 mm; Grade 2, shortened EZ less 
than 1 mm; and Grade 3, EZ not visible. </p>

<p>ZAS RshA from C. glutamicum (25). Except for NCgl0852 
from C. glutamicum, all ZAS genes are adjacent to ECF 
sigma factor genes. In M. tuberculosis and M. bovis 
strains, genes for ZAS (RshA) and sigma factor (SigH) 
are separated by a hypothetical ORF. 
We constructed a phylogenetic tree using a neighbor-
joining algorithm provided by <rs type="software">MEGA4</rs> program 
(Figure 1). Four reported redox-insensitive ZAS 
members were included in the phylogenetic analysis for 
comparison. These are RspChrR, BsuYlaD, BsuRsiW 
and ScoRsuA. Only the N-terminal ASD domain was 
included in multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic 
tree construction. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated 
that the majority of the retrieved homologs cluster closely 
with ScoRsrA (Group I), next to the second cluster </p>

<p>Figure 1. Phylogenetic relatedness of ScoRsrA homologs. A neighbor-joining tree of RsrA homologs were constructed by using <rs type="software">MEGA4</rs> with 
default parameters. In addition to 104 homologs retrieved by BlastP, ZAS factors which have been reported to be insensitive to oxidation (marked 
with diamonds) were included in the tree. Only the ASD that corresponds to ScoRsrA in each entry was compared. Sequence information for all 
entries is provided in the Supplementary Table S3. Reported redox-senstive RsrA homologs were marked with close circles. 
MtuRshA_M_tuberculosis_and_M_bovis represents 25 identical sequences from M. tuberculosis or M. bovis strains. The 10 homologs whose 
redox-sensitivity was experimentally examined in this study were marked with open circles. Homologs from non-actinobacteria were marked with 
open triangles. </p>

<p>Multiple sequence alignment of ASDs from nine redox-
sensitive and five insensitive ZAS factors reveal residues 
that are conserved across all ZAS and those that are re-
stricted to redox-sensitive ZAS from actinomycetes 
(Figure 3). In order to delineate broadly functional resi-
dues from subfamily-specific residues in a more systematic 
way, we compared differentially conserved sequence pat-
terns by constructing sequence logos through <rs type="software">TEXshade</rs> 
package (34,35). Figure 3 demonstrated conserved 
sequence logo of all 14 ZAS members, and a differentially </p>

<p>We created recombinant proteins by exchanging residues 
from K33 to K47 in ScoRsrA with the corresponding resi-
dues (V26 to H40) in RsiW from B. subtilis (Figure 4A). 
The truncated version of RsiW (T-RsiW) that contains 
only the N-terminal 87 amino acid of ASD without 
trans-membrane and extracellular domains was modified 
to make the recombinant. The secondary structure of the 
swapped product (ST-RsiW) was predicted unchanged by 
<rs type="software">Jnet</rs> program (39). The recombinant B. subtilis strains 
that harbor either T-rsiW or ST-rsiW genes in place of 
the wild-type rsiW were examined to determine whether 
diamide can induce SigW-specific gene expression. 
Production of ST-RsiW or T-RsiW was controlled by 
IPTG (14), and the amount of auto-regulated sigW tran-
scripts following diamide treatment was examined by S1 
mapping. 
Figure 4B demonstrates that when T-RsiW is induced, 
sigW expression is drastically reduced, confirming the abil-
ity of T-RsiW to bind and sequester SigW. Treatment with 
diamide did not activate SigW at all, and the sigW gene </p>

<p>Figure 3. Multiple sequence alignment and sequence logo of ScoRsrA homologs. Mulitple sequence alignment was carried out by using <rs type="software">MEGA4</rs>, 
followed by manual curation. Sequence logos were produced by using <rs type="software">TEXshade</rs>. The secondary structure prediction is based on the structural 
information of RspChrR (PDB;2Z2S). For alignment, we trimmed both N-terminal and C-terminal residues that extend beyond the ScoRsrA 
sequence. The nucleotide sequencing identified some sequence differences from the public database, and we used modified sequences for 
BlinB_010200019545, AAur_2640 and FRAAL6009 (+; Supplementary Table S3). Asterisk indicates entries that contain C-terminal domains in 
addition to ASD. </p>

<p>and the second was performed between days 14 and 21 
after randomization. All images were analyzed by a Core 
Imaging Laboratory (Translational and Molecular Imaging 
Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New 
York, NY, USA). 
For each imaging time point, bilateral lower extremity 
and lower pelvis MRV with contrast was performed in a 
single examination of approximately 60 minutes. 8 For sub-
jects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 60 
ml/min), a dose of 0.03 mmol/kg (0.12 ml/kg) Ablavar ® 
(gadofosveset trisodium; Lantheus Medical Imaging, North 
Billerica, MA, USA) was injected at a rate of 2 ml/second. 9 
Ablavar is a blood pool contrast agent with favorable prop-
erties for venous imaging. 
After acquiring scout and time-of-flight images to iden-
tify the arterial vasculature, three dimensional (3D) 
T1-weighted gradient echo images (GRE; VIBE, LAVA) 
were acquired before and after the injection of Ablavar to 
estimate thrombus volume. Thrombus volume was assessed 
utilizing contrast-enhanced MRV images after the contrast 
agent circulated for 5 minutes to ensure a steady state in the 
blood pool. To determine locations and extent of thrombus, 
pre-and post-contrast 3D gradient echo sequences were 
acquired from: (1) the mid-calf to above the knee, (2) above 
the knee to the thigh and lower pelvis, and (3) thigh and 
lower pelvis to abdomen. 
Image analysis (Supplementary material) was performed 
on a dedicated workstation (Apple Mac Pro ® with <rs type="software">OsiriX 
MD</rs>) by two treatment-blinded experienced image analysts. 
Baseline and follow-up MRV images were compared for 
each subject for the following venous segments: external 
iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, 
popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, gastrocnemius, 
and peroneal veins. 
For MRV images, analysts traced 3D curved multiplanar 
reconstructions, using contours following the centerline of 
each venous segment, and produced 1 mm axial slices per-
pendicular to the curved path. Analysts then manually seg-
mented regions of interest corresponding to the thrombus. 
Thrombus volume was calculated by multiplying the area 
of interest (thrombus) by the slice thickness (1 mm) using a 
custom <rs id="software-1" type="software">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Mathworks Inc.</rs>., Natick, MA, USA) 
script. Total thrombus volume in each subject was calcu-
lated by adding the thrombus volumes in each vessel. 
The eTRIS-DVT total score was calculated as the sum 
of the individual modified Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor 
Deep Vein Thrombosis (ODIXa-DVT) vessel score for ves-
sels in which thrombus was present. The ODIXa-DVT 
score is a validated method for calculating thrombus bur-
den based on the finding of non-compressibility on venous 
ultrasonography in prespecified venous segments. 10 The 
eTRIS volumetric DVT total score was calculated as the 
product of the thrombus volume in the vessel and the modi-
fied ODIXa-DVT score for that vessel. </p>

<p>The total intended sample size of approximately 90 sub-
jects (60 in the edoxaban group, 30 in the parenteral antico-
agulant 'bridge' to warfarin group) was chosen based on 
study feasibility, rather than on statistical considerations. 
To collect more information of relative thrombus volume 
change by MRV in the edoxaban treatment group, a 2:1 ran-
domization allocation ratio was used. 
Results for continuous variables were compared to base-
line using a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. For 
two-group comparisons, a two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon 
rank sum was used for continuous data, and Fisher's exact 
test was used for binary data. All p-values were two-sided, 
and a p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the modi-
fied intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis set: all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of randomized 
study drug. The primary safety analysis (on-treatment) was 
performed using the safety analysis set: all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of randomized 
study drug according to the treatment actually received. 
Data analyses were performed using software <rs id="software-2" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">Version 8.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC, USA). 
The relative change of thrombus volume from baseline 
was calculated as the difference between Day 14-21 
and baseline measurements divided by the baseline </p>

<p>Microarray data was analyzed by <rs type="software">minfi</rs> [10] and <rs type="software">shinyMethyl</rs> [11] 
packages available through <rs type="software">Bioconductor</rs> [12]. </p>

<p>Microarray methylation data was normalized by <rs type="software">missMethyl</rs> pack-

<p>and 93.7% on B. subtilis and E. coli genomes, respec-
tively, measured on experimentally validated operons. 
Our prediction program employs two classifiers, one for 
genomes with substantial numbers of experimentally vali-
dated operons and one for genomes with only limited or 
no such data. For the first case, our program was trained 
on a subset of the known operons, using a nonlinear (deci-
sion tree-based) classifier utilizing both general features of 
genomes and genome-specific features, while for the 
second case, our program was trained based only on 
general features of genomes, using a linear (logistic func-
tion-based) classifier. The advantage of this strategy, i.e. 
combining genome-independent and genome-specific 
information when available, is clear as the program was 
recently ranked as the most accurate operon prediction 
program in the public domain by an independent assess-
ment of 14 operon prediction programs, across all three 
performance measurements: prediction sensitivity, speci-
ficity and overall accuracy (7). 
Using this prediction program, we have made operon 
predictions for all complete prokaryotic genomes (NCBI 
release of 2 May 2008), and organized the data into a rela-
tional database, DOOR. Currently, DOOR contains pre-
dicted operons for 675 organisms with 736 chromosomes 
and 489 plasmids, consisting of a total of 450 986 operons. 
The RNA genes and protein-encoding genes in NCBI 
release are treated the same by our operon prediction pro-
gram, so DOOR also contains operons for RNA genes. 
For each gene and operon in DOOR, we provide the 
following information collected from public databases. 
For each gene, we include its location in the genome, the 
name of the genome, its gene name, its GI number, its locus 
tag, its COG number(s), its molecular function described 
using a few keywords, a label for it being a protein-or 
RNA-encoding gene and its genomic sequence. To facil-
itate operon comparisons, DOOR also contains precalcu-
lated BLAST E-values and alignment bit-scores between 
each pair of potentially homologous genes across all 
genomes (with E-values lower than a preselected threshold) 
(see Tools supported by DOOR section for details). 
For each operon, the DOOR database contains its com-
ponent genes, its precalculated promoter sequence (up to 
200 bp, our default value), its precalculated similar oper-
ons, a link to the relevant literature in the ODB database 
(3) and a link to its corresponding operon page at 
MicrobesOnline. 
The whole DOOR system is implemented on a Fedora 
Core 8 Linux computer using <rs type="software">MySQL</rs> as the database 
management system. DOOR employs Apache for its 
web server, and php to implement the dynamic web 
pages. In addition, the Wiki of the DOOR system is imple-
mented using <rs id="software-10" type="software">MediaWiki</rs> <rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">1.13.0</rs>. </p>

<p>Calcium imaging . Kidneys were loaded 50 -80 min before recording with the 
calcium-sensitive dye Oregon Green BAPTA-1 / AM (10 μ M, Molecular Probes ), 
and perfused with Krebs Ringer Buff er, consisting of, in mM, 100 NaCl, 4 KCl, 
20 HEPES, 25 NaHCO 3 , 1 CaCl 2 , 1.2 MgCl 2 , 1 NaH 2 PO 4 · H 2 O, 10 D -glucose, 
pH 7.35, at 37 ° C. In one protocol, CaCl 2 was excluded and replaced with 250 μ M 
ethylene glycol bis( β -aminoethylether)-N,N,N ′ , N ′ ,-tetraacetic acid ( Fig. 1f ). In-
tracellular calcium was imaged at 0.5 Hz using an argon laser (488 nm) and LP505 
long-pass fi lter on a LSM 510 Zeiss Duo inverted microscope . Image analysis was 
performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">ImageJ</rs> ( <rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://www.rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</rs>/ ) and custom-made scripts 
in MATLAB ( Th e MathWorks ). Each calcium trace was normalized using median 
fi ltered baseline fl uorescence. Low amplitude and high frequency noise were 
removed from the normalized signal using wavelet transformations (Daubechies 
3-d order). In the normalized and fi ltered data, a wave was defi ned as a signal that 
is 9 % over baseline 
37 . </p>

<p>Intracellular sodium measurements . Primary cultures of rat proximal tubule 
cells were prepared as described previously 
10,39,40 . Th e cells were loaded with 10 μ M 
SBFI-AM ( Invitrogen ) for 45 min at room temperature, followed by washing and 
30 min de-esterifi cation in normal media with 1 mM Probenecid ( Invitrogen ) 
at 37 ° C. Sodium measurements were taken at 35 ° C in a closed chamber ( FCS3 , 
Bioptechs ) with a cooled CCD camera ( ORCA-ERG , Hamamatsu ) mounted on 
an upright microscope ( Axioskop 2 FS , Zeiss ) with a Zeiss Fluar 40 × 1.3 NA oil 
objective. Excitation at 340 and 380 nm was performed with a monochromator 
( Polychrome IV , TILL Photonics ). Data acquisition and analysis was performed 
using <rs id="software-2" type="software">MetaFluor</rs> ( <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs> ). Cells were superfused with Krebs-Ringer 
with 1 mM probenecid. Calibration was performed using perfusion buff er with 
[Na 
+ ] + [K 
+ ] + [Choline 
+ ] = 140 and [Na 
+ ] = 0, 5 or 15 mM, with 6 μ M Gramicidin D , 
20 μ M Monensin and 1 mM Ouabain (all from Sigma ). </p>

<p>Expression of Wt1 and Pax2 genes . Total RNA was extracted from a single em-
bryonic kidney using the Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit ( Bio-Rad ) according to the 
manufacturer ' s recommendations. Relative real-time reverse transcription -PCR 
was performed according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations for iScript 
One-Step RT -PCR Kit with SYBR Green ( Bio-Rad ). Quantifi cation was performed 
in quadruplet for each sample. Commercial 18S Classic II primers ( Ambion ) were 
used to control genomic DNA contamination, to normalize RNA quality and start-
ing quantity, as well as random tube-to-tube variation in reverse transcription (RT) 
and PCR reactions. Serial dilution of reference RNA sample as template was used 
to generate standard curve for each real-time RT -PCR experiment. Th e standard 
curve was constructed by plotting the log of the starting quantity of total RNA 
against the C t value. Th e starting quantity of Wt1 and Pax2 mRNA in each test 
sample was estimated using <rs id="software-3" type="software">iQ iCycler</rs> soft ware ( <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Bio-Rad</rs> ) using values from the 
standard curve and normalized using 18S RNA as reference. Values are presented 
as % of control (10 % FBS in Figure 4a,b , 0.2 % FBS in Figure 4c,d ). Rat Wt1 mRNA 
structure 
41 (accession number X69716) was used to select Wt1-specifi c prim-
ers: upper, 5 ′ -TGCCACACCCCTACCGACAGTT-3 ′ ; lower, 5 ′ -CTTCAAGG-
TAGCTCCGAGGTTCATC-3 ′ . Th e position of rat Wt1 primers corresponds to 
a common part of all Wt1 mRNA splice variants. Th e rat Pax2 mRNA structure </p>

<p>Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated 
at least three times. Experimental data were presented as 
mean ± standard deviation and treated for statistics analysis 
by <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> program. Comparison between groups was made 
using analysis of variance, and statistically significant dif-
ference was defined as P,0.05. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Data were analysed with a statistical programme <rs id="software-0" type="software">JMP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.1</rs> Start 
Statistics, third edition (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, 
USA). Differences between WT and reporter lines were tested 
using One-Way-ANOVA and data were pooled when no difference 
was found. Data are means (6SE). Separation of means was 
performed by t test. A probability level of P &lt;0.05 was considered 
to indicate significant differences. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis was carried out using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 21.0</rs>) for Windows. The values of the variables 
are presented as arithmetic means with standard deviations 
or as frequencies or other descriptive statistical forms. The 
dominant genetic model was used, and the associations of 
having at least one minor allele versus having two wild-type 
alleles were tested. Association tests between the genotypes 
and the demographic traits were carried out with χ 
2 tests 
and Mann-Whitney U-tests. Association tests between the 
genotypes and the clinical responses were performed using 
analysis of covariance, with the current antipsychotic dose 
acting as a confounder. The differences in allele frequencies 
between responsive and resistant schizophrenic patients were 
assessed using χ 
2 tests. The limit of statistical significance 
was set at 0.05. </p>

<p>Signal simulations were performed using extended phase 
graphs (8), including gradient de-phasing as well as 
radiofrequency pulses and signal evolution. The pattern 
recognition reconstruction was implemented following 
(2). All code for simulation and pattern recognition was 
written in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Matlab</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Mathworks</rs>, Natick, MA). The diction-
ary contained values of T1 ranging from 80 ms to 1000 
ms in steps of 20 ms, and from 1 to 2.5 s in steps of 50 
ms. Values of T2 ranged from 10 ms to 100 ms in steps 
of 2 ms and from 105 ms to 250 ms in steps of 5 ms. B1 
was modelled by a flip-angle factor, a linear factor equal 
to the obtained flip angle divided by the desired flip 
angle. Values for this parameter were simulated from 50 
to 150% in 2% increments. </p>

<p>Our econometric methodology is to fit, for each of RREU, RRRD, AREU and 
ARRD, the models to the decisions of the subjects, for each of the four elicitation 
methods, and hence obtain estimates of the risk aversion index (and also the other 
parameters). We do this by Maximum Likelihood, using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Matlab</rs> (the program is 
available in <rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1</rs>/). To do 
this we need to make assumptions about the stochastic nature of the data. This arises 
from errors made by the subjects. We largely follow convention. </p>

Chinese genotyped by Sequencing (Sequen_HK) and Illumina Beadchip (Illumkna550K), Thai samples genotyped by sequencing (Sequen_Thai) and HapMap 
Caucasians data (HapMap_Cau). Colour scheme is according to Haploview r 
2 scheme with darker colour representing better r 
2 -value. Numbers in each cell stand 
for pairwise r 
2 -values and an empty cell means pairwise r 
2 equals to 1 between the corresponding SNPs. </p>

<p>All SNPs were tested for significant deviation from Hardy -
Weinberg equilibrium in controls and all passed the test 
with P-values . 0.05. The SNPs were analyzed for an associ-
ation with the disease by means of comparison of the minor 
allele frequency in patients and controls (basic allelic test) 
as well as other tests using <rs type="software">Plink</rs> (18). LD patterns were ana-
lyzed and displayed by <rs type="software">HaploView</rs> (20). Association of the 
SNPs with disease risk was also corrected by logistic 
regression using age and sex as covariates and the associations 
found in this study remain significant after all the corrections. 
Average ORs and P-values jointly analyzed from both the 
Hong Kong Chinese and the Thai populations were obtained 
by CMH test of association conditional on SNP differences 
between the two populations. Potential heterogeneity of ORs 
for a given SNP between the two populations was tested 
both by Breslow -Day test and by partitioning the x 
2 statistic 
between the two populations. Test of independent contribution 
of a SNP controlling for the effect of other SNPs in the same 
gene was done by logistic regression as well as haplotype ana-
lyses. Association with subphenotype was analyzed by com-
paring cases with a certain subphenotype with controls, 
cases without the subphenotype with controls, heterogeneity 
test of two ORs so derived and direct comparison of the 
cases with and without the subphenotypes. </p>

<p>Prediction and validation of targets for SorY 
Many sRNAs act on gene expression by base pairing to target 
mRNAs and influencing either the stability of these targets or the 
rate of translation or both. To get a hint on possible targets of 
SorY we compared the transcriptomes of a control strain har-
bouring an empty vector (2.4.1pBBR) and of the overexpressing 
strain (2.4.1pBBRSorYi) after 10 min of 
1 O 2 stress by microar-
ray analysis (Fig. S1). From 3976 genes with a reliable A-value 
17 protein coding genes showed a log 2 fold change of &gt; 0.6 or &lt; 
¡0.6 between the 2 strains (Table 1). Putative interaction of the 
mRNAs transcribed from these genes and SorY were predicted 
by the <rs type="software">IntaRNA</rs> tool. 
24 Table 1 shows the predicted parameters 
of genes with expression changes for which an energy value of 
less than ¡10 kcal/mol was calculated for a putative interaction. 
The effect of SorY on mRNA levels was confirmed by real time 
RT-PCR for RSP_2400, RSP_0097, sufC, and adhI (Fig. 2A). 
The microarray data for flgF could not be confirmed and 
RSP_0432 was not tested, since no function for this gene is pre-
dicted. Real time RT-PCR also demonstrated that deletion of 
SorY had an opposite effect on the transcript levels of these 
mRNAs than overexpression of SorY (Fig. 2A). 
To test whether the mRNAs are direct targets of SorY we 
applied an in vivo reporter system suitable for a-proteobacteria. </p>

cal duplicates were performed. Error bars indicate standard deviations. </p>

<p>Microarray analysis 
Microarray analysis was performed as described before (Mank 
et al., 2012). Total RNA, obtained from aerobically grown cul-
tures of strains 2.4.1pBBRSorYi and 2.4.1pBBR after 10 min of

was performed with the Bio-conductor package <rs type="software">Limma</rs> for R. 
On the basis of calculated MA plots, genes were considered reli-
able if the average signal intensity [A-value: 1/2 log2

changes among genes that passed the reliability criterion, a cutoff 
value was applied; i.e., those genes were retained whose average 
expression value of 2.4.1pBBRSorYi (a) compared with the aver-
age value of the control treatment 2.4.1pBBR (b) was either a

<p>Modeling of the I-PpoI DNA interface of native and 
variant proteins was done using <rs type="software">RosettaDesign</rs> (34,35). 
In brief, changes to the substrate DNA sequence and the 
amino acid sequence of the protein were simulated in 
silico, and the DNA-protein complex was allowed to relax 
according to an energy function that mimics protein 
folding. I-PpoI variants E, G and T were modeled and 
visualized for inspection using the <rs id="software-3" type="software">PyMOL</rs> molecular

<p>revealed that K65 forms a single H-bond to the guanine 
base at base pair 9, whereas K65R substitution make two 
H-bonds to base pairs at positions 8 and 9 (compare 
Figure 4 panels B and C). These contacts are energetically 
more favorable than the single contact made by the native 
K65 residue (À1.22 units for R65 versus À1.09 units for 
K65; <rs type="software">RosettaDesign</rs> analyses not shown). Neither K nor 
R65 residues contact target site position 6, and thus do not 
discriminate between native or mutant +6C/-6G target 
site DNAs. 
R61K substitutions decrease the DNA-binding affinity 
of I-PpoI, while increasing target site selectivity to favor 
the binding of mutant, +6C/-6G target site DNA </p>

<p>Initially, a native dataset was collected and several 
attempts were made to solve the structure of SceTyrRS 
by the molecular replacement techniques. The structures 
of several TyrRSs complexed with or without cognate 
tRNA 
Tyr and deposited in the Protein Data Bank, having 
ca. 10-20% sequence identity with SceTyrRS, were used 
as search models. Secondly, attempts were made to find 
good heavy-atom derivatives for phasing by the isomor-
phous replacement techniques. Since both of these 
attempts failed, we prepared a Se-Met substituted 
SceTyrRS using LeMaster medium (47) and E. coli 
B834(DE3) cells for phasing by the multiwavelength 
anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. The MAD data 
collection was performed at beamline 38B1, SPring-8. 
XAFS measurements were carried out around the 
selenium K absorption edge using an Se-Met SceTyrRS 
crystal in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. 
Subsequently, four datasets were collected from a new 
single crystal of Se-Met SceTyrRS on and around the 
selenium K absorption edge at 100 K using an ADSC 
Quantum-4R CCD detector. All datasets were integrated 
using the program package DPS (48). Scaling and 
processing were performed using the <rs type="software">CCP4</rs> program 
suite (49). Thereafter, a high-resolution dataset was 
collected from a single crystal of native SceTyrRS at 
beamline 40B2, SPring-8 ( = 1.00 Å ) in a similar way. 
The data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. </p>

<p>Initial phase calculation was carried out at 3.0-Å 
resolution using the program <rs type="software">SHARP/autoSHARP</rs> (50). 
Of the nine selenium sites, seven were found. 
Interpretation of the electron density maps and model-
building procedures were carried out on a Linux PC with 
the aid of the program X-fit as implemented in the 
program <rs id="software-2" type="software">XtalView</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 4.0</rs> (51). The obtained model 
was refined at 2.4-Å resolution with the programs <rs type="software">CNS</rs> 
(52) and <rs type="software">REFMAC</rs> (53). After each refinement calcula-
tion, the obtained model was corrected with difference 
Fourier maps using XtalView. Water molecules were 
picked by the water-add routine in XtralView. The 
stereochemistry of the model was verified using the 
program PROCHECK in the <rs type="software">CCP4</rs> program suite. 
The present model includes residues 8 to 356 of 
SceTyrRS, one tRNA 
Tyr molecule, one Tyr-AMPN 
molecule, one magnesium ion and 57 water molecules 
per asymmetric unit. Residues 224-233 of SceTyrRS, the 
base moieties 16, 20, 31, 40, 41 and 46 of tRNA

tion coefficient was calculated. Bland-Altman analyses were 
carried for sPAP and RAP measurements to show systematic 
deviations. For discrimination of sPAP threshold, receiver 
operating characteristics analysis was conducted. Sensitivity, 
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as 
accuracy were analyzed for different cut-off values. </p>

<p>Randomisation methodology 
To allow for flexible randomisation independent of 
office hours, randomisation will be performed by using 
sealed envelopes provided by the sponsor, which are 
kept at the clinical trial sites. The randomisation code 
will be generated by the Clinical Trials Unit, Medical 
Center-University of Freiburg. Randomisation will be 
performed stratified by trial site, in blocks of variable 
size in a ratio of 1:1. Block size will be documented sep-
arately and will not be disclosed to the sites. The ran-
domisation code will be produced by validated 
programmes based on the Statistical Analysis System 
(<rs type="software">SAS</rs>). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared. A 
blind review of the data will be performed after the end 
of the planned follow-up period without looking at the 
randomised treatment for each patient. If the statistical 
analysis plan contains any changes to the analyses out-
lined in the trial protocol, they will be marked as such, 
and reasons for amendments will be given. All statistical 
programming for analysis will be performed with the

<p>The radio-transmission pH-measurement system con-

low-power radio transmission system (429 MHz band), 
which could be operated without a license in accordance 
with Japanese Radio Law. The mean variations of the

after 2 months of continuous recording, compared to 
the values confirmed by a standard pH solution at the 
start of the recording. The mean lifetime of the internal

<p>A significant shortcoming of the earnings data is that many records are 
censored at the Social Security maximum taxable earnings level. In addition, the 
real value of the tax ceiling changed substantially during the time period of 
interest, rising from a little over $15,000 (in 1982-1984 dollars) in 1963-1964 to 
about $20,000 in 1970 -1971. At least 32 percent of the sample is classified as 
earning the top-coded amount from 1958 to 1974, and this share fluctuates 
considerably during the key periods, reaching a peak of 54 percent in 1965. 
Consequently, any estimates of the impact of Title VII on the black-white earnings 
gap that do not explicitly account for censoring at the tax ceiling and changes in 
it could be severely biased. 
We use several approaches to estimate the interval censoring model. The 
dependent variable in each case is the natural logarithm of annual taxable earn-
ings, and the explanatory variables are race, level of education, age and age-
squared. Table 1 presents the estimation results for the race and education coef-
ficients based on the various estimators. The first column, headed OLS1, contains 
the ordinary least squares estimates based on all of the data. The second column, 
headed OLS2, presents the least squares results using only the observations that are 
not censored. The third column contains the Tobit maximum likelihood estimates 
under the assumption that the errors are normally distributed and homoskedastic. 
The remaining columns present the results for the three semiparametric estima-
tors: CLAD, SCLS and ICLAD. The Tobit, CLAD and SCLS estimators were imple-
mented using the <rs type="software">Stata</rs> software package, while the ICLAD estimator was calculated 
using the <rs type="software">Gauss</rs> package. For each estimator, we have created <rs type="software">Stata</rs> "ado" files that 
are available at ͗http://elsa.berkeley.edu/ϳkenchay͘. </p>

<p>7 Over 84 percent of the men in the sample have positive earnings in 1963-1964. This figure is 
83 percent in 1970 -1971. 
8 The standard errors for OLS, MLE and ICLAD were calculated using standard approximations. The 
standard errors for CLAD and SCLS were calculated using the bootstrap techniques discussed by 
Brownstone and Valletta in this issue. It is much more efficient to calculate the ICLAD estimator using 
<rs type="software">Gauss</rs> instead of <rs type="software">Stata</rs>. </p>

prepared using the Nextera XT sample prep kit, and were 
sequenced on the MiSeq platform with 300 bp paired-end reads 
(MiSeq Reagent Kit v3). MinION libraries were prepared from 
genomic DNA sheared by G-tube (Covaris) using the SQMAP-
004 kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The MinION library 
was sequenced on a R7.3 flow cell using the MinION sequencer 
(Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Raw data were basecalled 
using <rs type="software">Metrichor</rs> software (r7.X 2D Basecalling rev 1.12), and 
extracted using <rs type="software">Poretools</rs> [5]. Data from two Nextera XT li-
braries and one MinION library (2D filtered reads) were hybrid 
assembled using the SPAdes Genome Assembler (v3.5.0) [6]. 
Contigs were assembled and circularized using the Geneious 
Assembler (Biomatters). The complete genome was annotated 
using the Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology 
(RAST) [7]. The S. condimenti StO 2014-01 chromosome and

respectively. </p>

<p>Comparative genomics and identification of virulence 
factors 
Accessions of the reference genome sequences used in this 
study are provided in Table 2. BRIG [8] was used for whole 
genome comparison. Proteins were considered to be homologs 
having at least 90% sequence identity over at least 60% align-
ment length. <rs type="software">ClustalX2</rs> [9] and <rs id="software-4" type="software">FigTree</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">v1.4.2</rs> were used for 
sequence alignments and phylogeny. Putative virulence factors 
were identified by protein sequence blast against the Virulence 
Factors Database using BLAST+ and PfamScan against the Pfam-
A database. Putative horizontally transferred pathogenicity 
islands were identified using Alien Hunter [10]. </p>

<p>The S. cerevisiae Hi-C contact data (HindIII, pre-FDR, 
no masking) from (7) (Supplementary Data) were down-
loaded from https://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/yeast-

normalization of this contact data to control for GC 
content, mappability and fragment length using <rs type="software">HiC-
Norm</rs> (25) genome-wide (chromosome by chromosome) 
as per (17) and then generated a new 3D reconstruc-
tion using the constrained optimization approach (7). 
The HiCNorm source code was downloaded from

<p>The raw ChIP-seq data set (18), which contains three in-
put samples (Swi6, Tup1 and RNA polymerase II phos-
phorylated at serine 5 (Pol2ser5p)) and a mock immuno-
precipitation (IP) control sample (DMSO, Illumina), was 
obtained from GEO (data set GSE51251; http://www.ncbi. 
nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc = GSE51251). We con-
verted the raw sequencing SRA data to FASTQ format us-
ing '<rs id="software-12" type="software">fastq-dump</rs>' <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">version 2.3.4</rs> in the sequence read archive 
(<rs type="software">SRA) Toolkit</rs> (26). We aligned the reads to the S. cere-
visiae reference genome (sacCer2) using Bowtie 2 (27) ver-
sion 2.2.1 with default parameters and then converted the 
sequence alignment / map (SAM) output to binary align-
ment / map (BAM) format using <rs id="software-15" type="software">SAMtools</rs> (28) <rs corresp="#software-15" type="version-number">version 0.1.19–44428cd</rs>. We filtered the sequencing reads (using the 
R package '<rs id="software-16" type="software">ShortRead</rs>' (29) <rs corresp="#software-16" type="version-number">version 1.20.0</rs> with a custom fil-
ter) to retain only those with two or less expected errors per 
read: given a Phred quality score q for each base call, the 
probability that a base call is erroneous is P = 10 
(− q / 10) , 
which is then summed over the bases in the read to give 
the expected errors per read. Using '<rs type="software">ShortRead</rs>' (29), we 
deduplicated the reads to control for PCR amplification 
bias (30,31) and masked the highly repetitive chromosome 
XII rDNA region (via a custom filter) because of the diffi-
culty of aligning short reads there. We log 2 -normalized each 
ChIP-seq sample to the mock IP control using the function 
get.smoothed.enrichment.mle() in the R package 'spp' (32) </p>

<p>version 1.11 with a 200 basepair (bp) bandwidth and 100 bp 
stepsize. 'spp' was downloaded from http://compbio.med. 
harvard.edu/Supplements/ChIP-seq/. 
We performed a smoothing step to control for the lo-
cal dependency of the signal in linear genomic space, since 
we are interested in identifying 3D hotspots of physically 
proximal yet genomically distal ChIP-seq peaks in sub-
sequent analyses. Specifically, we smoothed each normal-
ized ChIP-seq signal along each chromosome arm using 
<rs type="software">SuperSmoother</rs> (33), which is implemented as supsmu() 
in R (version 3.0.2) package '<rs type="software">stats</rs>', with the span deter-
mined by cross-validation. We then took the residuals of 
each smoothed normalized signal -this constitutes the fi-
nal 'ChIP-seq peak height' that we proceeded to superpose 
onto the 3D genome reconstruction. </p>

<p>The 3D genome reconstruction consists of a series of beads 
spaced along each chromosome; each bead has a genomic 
position and (X,Y,Z) coordinates. For each ChIP-seq in-
put, we binned its peak height data (i.e. the residuals of 
the smoothed log 2 -normalized signal) such that each bin 
was centered on a bead. We then assigned to each bead the 
most extreme ChIP-seq peak height (positive or negative) 
from the bin centered on that bead. The result is a 3D chro-
matin configuration reconstruction overlaid with functional 
genomic data: each bead now has a genomic position, phys-
ical coordinates (X,Y,Z) and a ChIP-seq peak height value. 
We visualized this superposed 3D reconstruction in <rs id="software-23" type="software">MacPy-
MOL</rs> <rs corresp="#software-23" type="version-number">1.3</rs> (34) by first converting the data to the Protein 
Data Bank (PDB) file format (35) with the ChIP-seq peak 
height value rescaled as the temperature factor (B-factor) in 
the PDB file. </p>

<p>We applied <rs type="software">PRIM</rs> using the R package 'prim' (36) to dis-
cover 3D hotspots in ChIP-seq peak height superposed on 
the 3D reconstruction. We used the default parameter set-
tings peel alpha = 0.5 and paste alpha = 0.01 (we explored 
alternative settings subsequently) and used min beads = 25, 
the smallest parameter setting out of those tested (10, 25, 
50 and 100) for which inter-chromosomal hotspots could 
be detected. After applying PRIM, each bead in the super-
posed 3D reconstruction now has a genomic position, phys-
ical (X,Y,Z) coordinates, a ChIP-seq peak height value and 
a numerical PRIM box label (the largest numerical label is 
a placeholder for the beads that were not boxed). We es-
timated the significance of all of the PRIM boxes (except 
for the placeholder) by permutations as follows. We pre-
served the mapping of beads to PRIM boxes, and then per-
muted the ChIP-seq peak height along each chromosome. 
Then, we computed the mean ChIP-seq peak height for 
each PRIM box from the permuted data. We repeated this 
for a total of 10 
5 permutations. The P-value of each box 
was estimated by comparing its mean ChIP-seq peak height 
from the observed data to its mean ChIP-seq peak height 
values from the permuted data. We ranked these potential 
3D hotspots by P-value and Holm-adjusted the P-values to 
account for multiple testing. To gauge the effect size of the </p>

<p>We applied k-NN regression to the ChIP-seq peak height 
superposed on the 3D reconstruction using the R package 
'<rs type="software">FNN</rs>' (37), where k is the specified number of physically 
proximal beads to be analyzed together as a grouping. First, 
we selected 'seed' beads evenly spaced along each chromo-
some by a bead interval of 0.5*k. Next, for each seed bead, 
we found its k nearest beads in Euclidean distance via the 
function knn.index() to create a bead grouping. Finally, we 
found the mean ChIP-seq peak height of each bead group-
ing via the function knn.reg() and ranked the list of bead 
groupings by mean ChIP-seq peak height. </p>

<p>We normalized the S. cerevisiae contact data from (7) us-
ing <rs type="software">HiCNorm</rs> (25) (see 'Methods') and then generated a 
new 3D genome reconstruction from the normalized con-
tact data via the constrained optimization approach from 
(7) as per (17) (the original study (7) preceded the formaliza-
tion of pipelines for normalizing Hi-C contact data (25,38-
40)). 
We focus on ChIP-seq data for the transcription fac-
tor Swi6 as the continuous functional genomic outcome. 
Swi6 is a component of two transcriptional regulatory 
complexes: SBF (composed of Swi6 and the sequence-
specific transcription factor Swi4) and MBF (composed of 
Swi6 and the sequence-specific transcription factor Mbp1) 
(41,42). SBF and MBF regulate genes that function in G1/S 
(e.g. cell growth genes, DNA synthesis genes) (41,42). 
We aligned the sequencing reads for Swi6 ChIP-seq and 
the sequencing reads for a mock IP control (18) to the 
reference genome and then log 2 -normalized the signal to 
the control (see 'Methods'). We applied quality control fil-
ters, performed read deduplication and obtained residuals 
from smoothing the signal along each chromosome arm 
(see 'Methods') -this constitutes the final 'ChIP-seq peak 
height' that we proceeded to analyze. 
We superposed the ChIP-seq peak height on the 3D 
genome reconstruction (Figure 1). The 3D reconstruction 
consists of a series of 'beads' spaced along each chromo-
some, with each bead having a genomic position and an 
(X,Y,Z) coordinate. We binned the Swi6 ChIP-seq peak 
height data at the same genomic spacing as the beads (see 
'Methods'). The result is that each bead now has a ge-
nomic position, an (X,Y,Z) coordinate, and a ChIP-seq 
peak height value. We applied PRIM to this data, with 
ChIP-seq peak height as outcome and (X,Y,Z) coordinates 
as covariates, to identify functional 3D hotspots. </p>

<p>Carbonylated proteins were derivatized with 2,4-dini-
trophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to form 2-4-dinitrophenylhydrazone 
(DNP) proteins adducts [23]. For total carbonyl quantification, 
equal quantities of proteins were loaded and separated by SDS-
PAGE 12% (v/v). Chemicals for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-
Rad. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained 
from Sigma-Aldrich. For the detection of carbonylated proteins, 
gels were electrotransferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose mem-
branes (GE Healthcare) and incubated with anti-DNP antibodies 
(1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich). Carbonylated proteins were revealed by a 
fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG 800CW (1:15,000) polyclonal antibody 
(LI-COR). Densitometry analyses were performed using NIH <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> 
software and the data are expressed as % volume in pixels. 
For 2D gel electrophoresis, derivatization of proteins carbonyls 
was achieved on IPG strips after isoelectric focusing (IEF), with a 
10 mM DNPH, 2 M HCl solution at room temperature (RT) as de-
scribed previously [24]. 500 mg of protein were diluted on a re-
hydratation buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 1% Amberlite, 4% 
CHAPS, 1.2% Destreak (GE Healthcare), 0.5% Pharmalyte pH 3-10 
(GE Healthcare)) and loaded into 13 cm IPG strips pH 3-10 NL (GE 
Healthcare). Gel rehydration of the IPG strips was done overnight 
at RT in an Immobiline DryStrip rewelling tray. IEF was performed 
using an Ettan™ IPGphor™ 3 Isoelectric Focusing System (GE 
Healthcare) at 20°C using the following electrical profile: step, 
150 V for 11 h; grad, 1000 V for 3 h; grad, 8000 V for 2 h; step, 
8000 V for 1 h. Neutralization step after derivatization with DNPH 
was performed with 2 M Trizma-Base containing 30% of glycerol 
(GE Healthcare). Before SDS-PAGE, all IPG strips were equilibrated 
with a 6 M urea, 10% SDS and 30% Glycerol (GE Healthcare), 0.5 M 
Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) solution for 2 steps of 15 min: the first one with </p>

parison, we used the data expressed as spot % volume (%vol) in 
pixels, which corresponds to a normalized value of the spot vo-
lume by considering the total volume of all the spots present in the 
membrane [25]. To take into account the total amount of loaded 
protein in each IPG strip, we defined a %vol per carbonylated spot 
(N%vol) by normalizing the %vol of each anti-DNP incubated 
membrane with its corresponding %vol on the Fast Green-sta-
tioned membrane. The relative modification index ratio (RMI ratio) 
was obtained by dividing the N%vol of the old group of samples by 
the N%vol of the young one. </p>

To design phylogenetic markers that are broadly applicable, we focused 
primer design on common regions of high sequence homology. Initially, we

isolate within <rs type="software">CLC Genomics Workbench</rs> software. This allowed us to target 
the high homology sequence regions shared across the fi ve isolates for posi-
tioning the primers. Out of the 58,295 successful reads of Sebacina from

<p>Background: Incidence of asthma in adolescents leads to variations in family status, roles and 
interaction with peers for them, which could be a source of stress and psychological tensions in them. 
Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of Orem's self-care model on 
perceived stress in adolescents with asthma. 
Methods: In this semi-experimental study conducted from April 2013 to February 2014, 64 asthmatic 
adolescents referring Shariati Hospital, Isfahan were enrolled by simple random sampling and the 
patients were assigned to two groups of control and intervention. Then, Orem's self-care model-based 
training was implemented throughout eight sessions of two hours each and the Cohen Perceived Stress 
Scale was administered to both groups prior to and two months after the completion of the training. 
The data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistics consisting of paired t-test, independent 
t-test, Chi-square and Mann-Whitney using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 20</rs>. 
Results: Mean age of the participants was 14.15±3.12 years in the intervention group and 15.21±3.09 
years in the control groups. 68.8% and 59.4% of the participants were male in the intervention and 
control groups, respectively. Independent t-test indicated a significant difference in the mean scores 
of perceived stress in the intervention (25.46±5.31) and control groups (28.90±5.27) after the training. 
Also, the result of paired t-test indicated a significant difference in the mean score of perceived stress 
between before (29.18±5.27) and after (25.46±5.31) training. 
Conclusion: As the training based on Orem's model had a positive effect on declining perceived 
stress in asthmatic adolescents, continuation of using these training interventions could contribute to 
ultimately achieving positive outcomes in health functions of these patients. </p>

<p>The following objective approach was used to delineate tracts of 
interest in this study. Diffusion tensor image analysis was performed 
using <rs type="software">FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox</rs> (FDT) included in <rs id="software-4" type="software">Functional MRI of 
the Brain Software Library</rs> (FSL) (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Analysis Group</rs>, FMRIB, Oxford, UK) 
(Smith et al., 2004). Image artifacts due to eddy currents and bulk 
head motion were minimized including b-matrix rotation during 
motion correction (Smith et al., 2004). Non-brain tissue was removed 
(Smith et al., 2002). Scalar maps for mean tract FA, MD, AD and RD 
were generated. Because the component diffusion metrics may provide 
more specific information about the underling tissue properties they 
were included in our analysis (Budde et al., 2007; Song et al., 2003). 
For poststroke participants, high-resolution anatomical images were 
masked to null voxels in the region of their lesion to minimize lesion 
related structural changes from affecting the registration. Affine (12 
degrees-of-freedom) registration was used to obtain transformation 
matrices first between the diffusion and anatomical space and then 
between the anatomical and standard space (Montreal Neurologic </p>

<p>Differences between the stroke and control group for HASTe score, 
brain volume, and age were determined using the two-sample t-test; 
p-Values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant (Table 1). Because our 
stroke an control groups were closely matched for handedness, to 
determine the effect of group (control, right hemisphere stroke, left 
hemisphere stroke) for each tract, we decided to compare right and 
left hemispheres directly, rather than comparing lesioned hemisphere 
to non-dominant hemisphere, two-sample t-tests were used for this 
comparison. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons 
using false discovery rate (FDR) correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 
1995). Corrected p-values were considered statistically significant at 
p ≤ 0.03 (Table 2). 
Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity are known to reflect 
white matter integrity following stroke. Of the two metrics, in 
our data, MD had the lowest coefficient of variation across the 10 
frontoparietal network tracts we quantified in both the poststroke 
and control groups, therefore it was used for the following three 
analyses: 1) to explain frontoparietal network variance principal 
components' analysis (PCA) was conducted on the correlations 
across the 10-frontoparietal tract mean MD values (Table 3). 2) To 
evaluate the relationship between haptic performance of the affected 
hand and network integrity we examined the relationship between 
ipsilesional and interhemispheric tract MD and HASTe scores using 
Pearson correlation coefficient. Bonferroni correction for 6 comparisons 
resulted in an adjusted alpha of p b 0.008 (Table 3). 3) To evaluate how 
well frontoparietal white matter integrity and other variables (age, 
brain volume and lesion volume) predicted HASTe scores of the affected 
and less affected hand we used forward stepwise multiple regression.

<p>The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) captures the antidisciplinary ethos 
of the MIT Media Lab. Like the Lab, it opens new connections between 
science and design, encouraging discourse that breaks down the barriers 
between traditional academic disciplines. It explores not only the design 
of science, but also the science of design. 
With this innovative approach, JoDS intends to incite much-needed 
change in academic publishing by challenging traditional academic silos 
as well as the established publishing practices associated with them. 
The journal is hosted on an open-access, open-review, rapid 
publication platform called <rs id="software-1" type="software">PubPub</rs>, created by <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">students at the Media Lab</rs>. <rs type="software">PubPub</rs> is a collaborative publication environment with rich 
commenting features, and powerful, intuitive authoring tools. JoDS 
articles are authored directly within the <rs type="software">PubPub</rs> environment, which 
provides support for multimedia, image integration, and large data sets. 
Unlike journals that operate within a formal peer review system and 
rigid disciplinary framework, JoDS invites jargon-free communication 
across all fields of design and science, unconventional formats, and 
widespread community participation. JoDS empowers authors to engage 
in fruitful, ongoing discussion about their work with members of many 
different communities, both within and outside of their home disciplines. 
This rich, peer-to-peer approach to review provides for a much broader 
array of perspectives, new pathways forward, and emergent topics for 
further research. 
JoDS is shepherded by a team led by MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito, 
and published in partnership with the MIT Press. All JoDS articles are

Reagent (TAKARA, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. Total RNA was reserve transcribed and 
amplified in a GeneAmp PCR system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, 
Germany). Primers used in the reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction were of: adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL; for-

<p>Yeast growth assays 
Growth assays were performed as previously described (Zubko 
et al, 2004). Pooled colonies were inoculated into 2 ml of YEPD and 
grown to saturation at 231C. Five-fold serial dilutions were 
replicated onto agar plates and grown at a range of temperatures. 
Plates were photographed using an SPimager (S&amp;P Robotics). 
Levels were adjusted with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Photoshop</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">CS4</rs>. </p>

<p>levels. Based on this system, degeneration was graded as 
'normal' (Pfirrmann's grade I), 'mild' (Pfirrmann's grade 
II) and 'advanced' (grades III-V). This was based on Lam 
et al. [14]'s findings of a positive provocative discography 
in 0%, 9%, and 71% of patients with Pfirrmann's grades I, 
II, III respectively and 100% in patients with Pfirrmann's 
grade IV and V. Lam et al. [14] stated that Pfirrmann's 
grading correlated strongly with the clinical symptoms. 
Radiological images of 1,000 consecutive patients meet-
ing the inclusion criteria were selected for each group 
retrospectively from the hospital's OPD and operation 
records. The sample size of 3,000 was calculated from a 
similar study by Kong et al. [11], in which they found no 
significant difference between the LSTV and non-LSTV 
groups in degenerative spondylolisthesis patients, with a 
p-value of 0.8 and a sample size of 78, using "the N mas-
ter software. " In order to maintain consistency and avoid 
inter-observer variability, all the observations, classifica-
tions and grading were done by a single qualified spinal 
surgeon. The study was conducted in a major tertiary care 
centre with a daily OPD input of 6,000 patients including 
all specialities. The chi-square and proportion tests were 
used to compare 2 sets of variables and a p-value of less

performed by computer-assisted image analysis (<rs id="software-0" type="software">Northern Eclipse</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 6</rs>) 
using light and immunofluorescence microscopy. The area of insulin-positive

Migration assay. CD4 
ϩ T-cells were plated on membrane inserts (8-m pore 
size) in serum-free RPMI 1640, and cell migration was assayed using Transwell 
chambers (Corning), in the presence or absence of purified porcine kidney 
DPP-IV (32.1 units/mg; 100 mU/ml final concentration; provided by Dr. 
Hans-Ulrich Demuth, Probiodrug, Halle, Germany) (28) Ϯ DPP-IV inhibitor 
(100 mol/l). After 1 h, cells on the upper surface were removed mechanically, 
and cells that had migrated into the lower compartment were counted. The 
extent of migration was then expressed relative to the control sample. 
Rac1 guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding assay. Total cellular extracts

<p>from these two video clips, both of them repeated 102 times in a ran-
dom order and without breaks in-between, with the restriction that the 
same blink (either normal or slow) did not occur more than twice in a 
row. The normal-speed clip lasted for 2718 ms, with a single voluntary 
452-ms blink starting at 1000 ms. The slow-motion clip was generated 
by slowing down the normal-speed video to 38% of the original speed, 
so that it lasted for 7135 ms, with a 1200-ms blink starting at 2634 ms. 
To keep the subject's attention, five other normal-speed videos 
(2038-2686 ms in duration) of facial expressions (aimed to convey 
'thinking', 'agreeing', 'confused', 'smiling' and 'disgusted', per-
formed by the same person whose eye blinks were shown) were 
inserted between the blink video clips once after every 34 stimuli. 
The subjects were told to memorize the expressions and to recog-
nize them after the session from a list of 10 possible expressions. A 
blank gray screen appeared for 1 s before and after each expression 
video. The complete stimulus sequence lasted for about 17 min. 
The original eye-blink video was recorded with a high-speed cam-
era (Fastec InLine 1000, Fastec Imaging, San Diego, CA, USA) at 
500 frames/s in front of a white background. The videos were pre-
sented to the subject with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Experiment Builder</rs> 
TM software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v. 1.10.1</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SR Research</rs>, Ottawa, ON, Canada). Due to video-projector restric-
tions, the presentation frame rate was 60 frames/s, so that only every 
seventh frame of the normal-speed stimulus and every third frame of 
the slow-motion stimulus was shown. Both videos appeared smooth 
and natural. The background color and the luminance of the screen 
were matched to the background of the video. 
The videos were presented on a screen (width 72 cm, height 
54 cm) placed 1 m in front of the subject's eyes, so that the size of the 
face in the video was approximately 14 cm 9 20 cm (visual angle 
11.5 deg 9 8.0 deg) in the center of the screen, and the size of an eye 
was approximately 2.6 cm 9 1.2 cm. The eyelid was moving verti-
cally approximately 1.2 cm during the blink. The Michelson contrasts 
between different eye features (cornea, eye white, eyelashes and eye-
lid) varied between 0.5 and 0.8, with an average contrast of 0.65. 
We aimed to create control stimuli that would have the same move-
ment characteristics as the eye blink, but would not resemble human 
eyes or facial gestures. Therefore, we showed videos of two horizontal 
black bars (constructed and presented at 30 frames/s) moving up and 
down on a gray background in the middle of the screen; the sizes, 
locations and movement time courses of the bars were matched to 
those of the blinks (Fig. 1): two bars (2.6 cm 9 0.035 cm) were mov-
ing 1.2 cm vertically on the screen with a time course similar to that 
of the blinks. During the 'open' and 'closed' periods, the bars 
remained at the highest or lowest position, correspondingly. The 
Michelson contrast between the bars and the background was 0.6. </p>

<p>The MEG data were preprocessed with the temporal signal-space-sepa-
ration method (Taulu &amp; Simola, 2006; Taulu &amp; Hari, 2009) using the 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">MaxFilter</rs> 
TM software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 2.2</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Elekta Neuromag Oy</rs>, Helsinki, Fin-</p>

<p>land). We computed vector sums over each pair of planar gradiometers 
to minimize the effect of source orientation in the analysed waveforms: 
the signals from the two orthogonal planar gradiometers in each MEG 
sensor were squared, summed, and finally the square root was 
computed of the sum. Thus, the resulting signals were always positive. 
We next computed areal averages of the vector sums over the 
posterior parieto-temporo-occipital brain regions, separately for each 
subject's left hemisphere (nine sensor pairs), central area (eight pairs) 
and right hemisphere (nine pairs; for area selection, Fig. 2). For each 
subject, the areal mean signals were normalized according to the indi-
vidual maximum in any of the three areas (over all conditions); the 
maximum was allowed to occur at any time after the start of the blink 
in the video during the 2-s (normal-speed stimuli) or 4-s (slow-motion 
stimuli) analysis periods. We compared areal mean signals instead of 
carrying out source analysis because the field patterns of the long-last-
ing signals were not dipolar and did not allow reliable source modeling. 
The peak amplitudes of the first prominent responses were mea-
sured with respect to a 500-ms baseline preceding the blink onset; dur-
ing the baseline period, the immobile face was visible. Before the 
amplitude measurements, the signals were low-pass-filtered at 30 Hz. 
To define the response onset, we searched for the best-fitting slope 
of the increasing areal mean response before the first prominent peak

<p>Quantitative coronary angiography was performed using 
standard quantitative analyses and definitions. 
[13] A main principle 
of our QCA approach was to ensure as little observer interference 
as possible. Angiograms obtained at baseline and before MV 
stenting were analyzed with the use of a computer-based system 
dedicated to bifurcation analysis (Qangio XA, version 7.3, Medis, 
Leiden, the Netherlands). We obtained quantitative angiographic 
measurements of the four segments of the bifurcation lesion: The 
proximal MV segment, the distal MV segment, the SB segment 
and the bifurcation core segment [Figure 2]. Bifurcation core is 
defined as the central part of the bifurcation which begins where 
the common vessel starts to split into two branches and ends at 
the carinal point, 
[14] which area was calculated by the <rs type="software">Qangio 
XA</rs> software. We also obtained the bifurcation angle (the angle 
between the distal MV and the SB) from the analysis system. </p>

<p>local telephone networks (Noll and Owen 1994). Similar issues have arisen in elec-
tricity transmission and distribution, in rail transport, and in gas and oil pipelines. 
Antitrust litigation, regulatory reform, and other remedies have mitigated many of 
these problems, but vertical issues remain in each industry. 
More recently, in the Microsoft (2002) antitrust litigation, the U.S. Department of 
Justice targeted <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft</rs>'s vertical integration of its <rs id="software-0" type="software">Windows</rs> operating system soft-
ware with <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> <rs id="software-1" type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>, a web browser, among other alleged abuses. 
This controversial and complex case was characterized by Microsoft as an unwise 
attack on its success in developing new technology. This view builds in part on Joseph 
Schumpeter's (1950) idea that an important form of competition involves innova-
tion-stimulating struggles for market dominance, success at which generates eco-
nomic rewards that incentivize investment in research and development of successive 
generations of technology (Evans and Schmalensee 2002; Schmalensee 2000). From 
a Schumpeterian perspective, Microsoft's monopoly of operating system software, 
far from being regrettable, was a necessary and temporary stimulant of continued 
technological progress. 4 
Hahn and Passel (2010) put the point succinctly in a recent online posting: 
Regulators need to recognize that in markets driven by rapidly changing technol-
ogy and huge economies of scale, it's natural for one firm or another to be king of 
the hill-albeit temporarily. So market share alone is no indicator of anticompetitive 
behavior or of the difficulty a newcomer with a better idea would have in competing 
for the business. 
The net neutrality debate is not unprecedented. Such debates are endemic to "net-
work industries," which often have or appear to have natural monopoly characteristics. 5 
Some courts (but not the Supreme Court Trinko (2004) pp. 410-11) have found in the 
Sherman Act a right of access to such "essential facilities." The right of access is for 
the benefit of competitors, not of the essential facility itself (it has none), but of the 
natural monopolist's upstream or downstream vertical businesses. A right of access for 
the benefit of customers usually is the result of administrative regulation rather than 
antitrust intervention. Regulators also offer access rights to competitors. Whether pro-
vided by antitrust courts or regulators, a meaningful right of access generally requires 
some form of price regulation, or at least a non-discrimination rule. Rules or decrees 
that compel access sometimes take the form of mandates to "interconnect" according 
to a given technical standard. 
The Act to Regulate Commerce, 6 the first federal common carrier statute, was 
motivated in large part by a kind of "net neutrality" movement. The "net" consisted 
of railroads. Shippers of agricultural products, who were resentful of discriminatory 
railroad rates, provided the political impetus. The original complaint was about a long-
haul/short-haul rate differential that was attributable to the exploitation of demand </p>

<p>METHODS 
Study design 
H9B-MC-BCDV (FLEX V; NCT01202773) was a phase 3, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study comprised of a 
screening period of 7-28 days, a 24-week treatment 
period and post-treatment follow-up for up to 48 weeks. 
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to treatment 
groups by a computer generated random sequence 
using the <rs type="software">Interactive Voice Response System</rs> (IVRS); the 
randomisation code was held by the vendor performing 
<rs type="software">IVRS</rs> functions. 
This study evaluated two subcutaneous (SQ) tabalu-
mab doses: 120 mg every 4 weeks (120/Q4W) or 90 mg 
every 2 weeks (90/Q2W), versus placebo. At week 0, 
patients assigned to a tabalumab regimen received a SQ 
loading dose that was twice the treatment dose (ie, 
240 mg or 180 mg). </p>

<p>Unless stated otherwise, all the experiments were performed 
at least three times. The experimental data are expressed as 
mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed 
using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni 
test with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS</rs>) 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">16.0</rs> software. *P0.05 was considered as statistically signif-
icant and **P0.01 as extremely statistically significant. </p>

<p>Statistical comparison between samples was evaluated by Student's 
t-tests performed using <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> <rs id="software-0" type="software">Excel</rs>. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
We performed an intention to treat meta-analysis in line 
with 
recommendations 
from 
the 
Cochrane 
Collaboration and the PRISMA Statement 
14 15 and used 
standard software for statistical analysis (<rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">V.9.0</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">STATA Corp.</rs>, Texas, USA). Heterogeneity was assessed 
using the I 
2 statistic, defined as the proportion of total 
variation observed between the trials attributable to dif-
ferences between trials rather than sampling error 
(chance), with values &lt;25% considered as low and &gt;75% 
as high. 
16 The pooled effect for each grouping of trials 
was derived from the point estimate for each separate 
trial weighted by the inverse of the variance (1/SE 
2 ). 
Continuous variable outcomes (PRU, per cent platelet 
inhibition) between the groups were compared with 
both a fixed effect model using the inverse variance 
method and a random effects model using the 
DerSimonian and Laird method. For cardiovascular out-
comes, rates were expressed per patient-years to adjust 
for the varying duration of follow-up. Results were there-
fore reported as incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs 
with the use of both a fixed effect model using the 
method of Mantel and Haenszel and a random effects 
model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird, 
with the estimate of heterogeneity being taken from the 
Mantel-Haenszel model. Publication bias was estimated 
using the weighted regression tests of Begg and Egger. </p>

a single dose of 6 Gy (100 cGy/min) with a XHA600C Medical Electron Linear Accelerator 
(Shinva Medical Instrument Co., Ltd, Zibo, Shandong, China). Splenic lymphocytes were 
isolated at 6 h after irradiation, and red cells were removed using Gey's solution. For flow 
cytometer analyses, splenic lymphocytes were centrifuged at 1000 r.p.m., and the 
supernatants were thoroughly removed by aspiration and fixed in 70% ethanol. After 
incubation with 40 mg/ml propidium iodide and 100 mg/ml RNase at 37 1C for 30 min, the

<p>Electrophysiology 
Planar lipid bilayers were formed across a 1.5-mm-diameter aper-
ture in a Teflon partition using DC 18:1 PC or DC 18:1 PC-long-chain 
PIP 2 suspensions in n-decane. The total phospholipid concentra-
tion was the same (15 mg/ml) in the pure and mixed lipid suspen-
sions. The aqueous solution was a 1 M NaCl and 10 mM HEPES, 
pH 7.0, solution; the temperature was 25 ± 1°C. Single-channel 
measurements were performed at 200 mV using a patch clamp am-
plifier (model 3900A; Dagan Corp.) and the bilayer punch method 
(Andersen, 1983). The current signal was filtered at 5 kHz, sam-
pled at 20 kHz, and digitally filtered at 500 Hz. After the bilayer was 
formed, gA analogues of different lengths and helix senses were 
added to both sides of the bilayer, and the solutions were stirred 
for 5 min (in a few experiments, only N-Me-gA(15) was added). 
After 30 min, to allow for gA incorporation, control current 
traces were recorded. In the experiments in which the lipids were 
added through the aqueous phase, short-or long-chain phospho-
lipids were added to both sides of the bilayer. The solutions were 
stirred for 1 min and equilibrated for 10 min before recording. 
Single-channel current transitions were identified using the al-
gorithm described previously (Andersen, 1983), implemented in 
software written in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Visual Basic</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft Corp.</rs>.). Single-channel 
lifetimes () were determined by fitting single exponential distribu-
tions to survivor histograms of the lifetime distributions using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Origin</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">6.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">OriginLab</rs>). At least 300 channels were collected in each ex-
periment. Changes in appearance frequency ( f ), the number of 
channels (opening followed by closing events) per unit of time, were 
determined only in experiments in which the bilayer remained in-
tact after adding the phospholipid. The results were reported as 
means ± SD; in case there were only two observations, the results 
were reported as means ± range. Relative changes in appearance 
frequency were determined by normalizing the appearance fre-
quency in the first two recordings right after the 10-min incubation </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
All data plots and statistical analyses were performed in <rs id="software-2" type="software">Origin</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">6.1</rs>. One population Student's t test was used to establish whether 
means were significantly different from 1 as indicated by asterisks 
(P ≤ 0.05). Two population, two-tailed, independent Student's 
t tests were used to establish whether two means were significantly 
different (P ≤ 0.05). A one-way ANOVA test performed on all 
compared means indicated significant differences (P ≤ 0.05). </p>

<p>the dependence in regimes 1 and 2, with the weights equal to the predicted proba-
bilities P (S t = 1| t −1 ) and P (S t = 2| t −1 ). Formulas (12) and (13) imply that an 
analogous property holds for the lower and upper tail dependence coefficients. 
Our comparison of the mean values of the mentioned dependence measures taken 
in the subperiods of equal length uses the model confidence set (MCS) methodology. 
The ranking of the periods according to the mean value of Spearman's rho is obtained 
with the MCS procedure applied sequentially-after each run, the series constitut-
ing the MCS are excluded. The higher score means the stronger dependence. In the 
case where the MCS consists of at least two periods, the arithmetic mean of the cor-
responding scores is assigned to each of them. The same procedure is conducted for 
the series of the predicted values of tail dependence coefficients. All MCSs (with 
the significance level α = 0.1) have been estimated using the package <rs id="software-2" type="software">MulCom</rs> of 
<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Hansen and Lunde</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-date">2010</rs>) written in <rs id="software-3" type="software">Ox</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Doornik</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-date">2006</rs>). 
Maximizing jointly the log-likelihood function (24) can be very computationally 
intensive. Therefore, as in many papers dealing with dynamic copula models, we 
separate the estimation of models for marginal distributions from the estimation of 
the model for the dependence structure. This two-stage estimation, proposed by Joe 
and Xu (1996), is not fully efficient but there are some simulation results that moti-
vate this approach (Patton 2009). For marginal distributions, we use ARMA-GARCH 
models. Since some of the analyzed periods are quite long and encompass periods of </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Differences among the mean values of the different groups 
were analyzed, and the values were expressed as mean±SD. 
Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t-test by 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 4</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">GraphPad Software</rs>, San Diego, 
CA, USA). Values of p＜0.05 were considered significant. </p>

<p>Collections were made as listed in Table 1 from the following 
countries mainly during the spring and summers of 2007 and 2008: 
Argentina (Tucumán), China (Yunnan), France (Deux-Sèvres 
Département), Germany (Frankfurt), and the United States of 
America (California, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Washington). 
Specimens consisting of overwintered, dead, attached, or fallen 
twigs and branches with perithecia were placed in paper bags, air-
dried, and stored at 8-10 °C in sealed plastic bags for a period of 
1 wk to 6 mo before processing. All specimens are deposited in the 
U.S. National Fungus Collections (BPI). 
Observations, measurements, and digital imaging of 
morphological characters and isolation of cultures were performed 
using the same equipment and procedures as in Mejía et al. (2008). 
<rs id="software-8" type="software">AxioVision</rs> <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">v. 4.7.2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Carl Zeiss Image Solutions</rs>, Carl Zeiss, New 
York, NY, USA) was used in conjunction with those methods to 
measure structures. Fresh specimens were mounted in water for 
microscopic observations; dried specimens were mounted in 3 % 
potassium hydroxide. Cultural characteristics were observed on 
Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA, Difco™, Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co., 
Sparks, MD, USA) 7 d after plating as described in Mejía et al. 
(2008). Colony diameters were measured twice perpendicularly 
and averaged and thus are listed as average colony diameter 
(a.c.d.). Representative cultures of species considered in this study 
were deposited at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures 
(CBS, The Netherlands) as listed in Table 1. </p>

<p>Editing and alignment of DNA sequences were performed as 
described in Mejía et al. (2008). Individual genes were aligned 
separately and subsequently concatenated into a single alignment. 
Table 1 includes detailed information about the gene sequences 
including GenBank numbers. The concatenated sequence 
alignment includes β-tubulin (1584 bp), ITS (625 bp), rpb2 (1212 
bp), and tef1-α (1149 bp) for a total of 4570 bp and 45 isolates. 
The taxa included in this alignment represent 24 of the 25 accepted 
species of Plagiostoma with Apiognomonia hystrix and A. veneta 
as outgroup taxa. Outgroup selection was based on the sister 
relationship of the genus Apiognomonia with Plagiostoma as 
inferred by a three-gene phylogeny of the family Gnomoniaceae 
(Sogonov et al. 2008). Positions with ambiguous alignment were 
excluded from the analyses. 
The concatenated alignment was partitioned by gene and codon 
position for β-tubulin, rpb2, and tef1-α using <rs id="software-9" type="software">PAUP</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Swofford</rs> 2002). 
The gene partitions were analysed for conflict with the partition 
homogeneity test (PHT) as implemented in <rs id="software-10" type="software">PAUP</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">Swofford</rs> 2002) 
using the following settings: 100 homogeneity replicates, 10 random 
sequence addition replicates, and MULTREES off. Conflict among 
gene partitions was assessed by reciprocal bootstrap analyses 
(Reeb et al. 2004) using distance settings for each partition as </p>

<p>determined by Modeltest v. 3.7 (Posada &amp; Crandall 1998) following 
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). 
Genes were first analysed individually and then as a combined 
alignment using maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and maximum 
likelihood analyses. Trees and bootstrap support of branches 
were estimated by MP analysis as in Sogonov et al. (2008) with 
all characters considered unordered with equal weight and an 
additional analysis with unordered characters weighted as follows: 
weight = 3 for first and second codon positions and weight = 1 
for third codon position. Additionally, trees were estimated using 
Bayesian analysis with the program <rs id="software-12" type="software">MrBayes</rs> <rs corresp="#software-12" type="version-number">v. 3.1.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-12" type="creator">Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist</rs> 2001) as described in Sogonov et al. (2008) with 
sampling every 500 generations. Model settings for each gene 
were determined using the program <rs id="software-13" type="software">MrModeltest</rs> <rs corresp="#software-13" type="version-number">v. 2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-13" type="creator">Nylander</rs> 
2004) and selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion 
(AIC). The first 50 000 generations were discarded (burn-in period) 
based on comparison of tree likelihood scores. A 50 % majority rule 
consensus tree and a consensus phylogram were constructed from 
the trees saved after the burn-in period. The Bayesian posterior 
probabilities (PP) of nodes of the consensus trees are presented 
in Fig. 1. Trees were also estimated by Maximum Likelihood (ML)

It is becoming clear through such collaborations that Elsevier journals are increas-
ingly used by readers. Thomas Sanville (2001), Executive Director of OhioLINK, 
has recently described their experience over four years with the usage of electronic 
journals. In that article, he provides an independent description of the real-life 
experience of libraries in an electronic consortium for the state of Ohio and, 
supported by facts and figures, probes the value element of electronic resource 
sharing within library consortia. 
As a result of consortial deals and other forms of electronic availability, the 
actual price paid by a library for access to a journal can vary greatly below the 
quoted list price. It is possible to obtain electronic access at large discounts to 
nonsubscribed titles within the economics subject collection. A hypothetical Sci-
enceDirect customer subscribing to 40 economics titles could gain electronic access 
to the remaining 37 economic journals as listed on ͗http://www.economicsdirect. 
com͘ at a discount of as much as 85 percent. 
There are also significant savings in administration and storage for a library 
that licenses <rs type="software">ScienceDirect</rs>. (On average, a library spends less than 30 percent of its 
total budget on journal/book material; over 70 percent goes to staff and the costs 
associated with housing, staff and administering the collection). Moreover, the 
essay does not factor in the significant benefits in convenience and time for faculty 
and students arising from the availability of all Elsevier journals from one electronic 
platform on the basis of IP-domain recognition. No passwords are required. </p>

<p>SuperLooper2 (SL2) (http://proteinformatics.charite. 
de/sl2) is the updated version of our previous web-
server SuperLooper, a fragment based tool for the 
prediction and interactive placement of loop struc-
tures into globular and helical membrane proteins. 
In comparison to our previous version, <rs type="software">SL2</rs> benefits 
from both a considerably enlarged database of frag-
ments derived from high-resolution 3D protein struc-
tures of globular and helical membrane proteins, and 
the integration of a new protein viewer. The database, 
now with double the content, significantly improved 
the coverage of fragment conformations and predic-
tion quality. The employment of the <rs type="software">NGL viewer</rs> for 
visualization of the protein under investigation and 
interactive selection of appropriate loops makes <rs type="software">SL2</rs> 
independent of third-party plug-ins and additional in-
stallations. </p>

<p>tion criterion. The database of globular and membrane pro-
teins has more than doubled since our previous publication 
(17). In order to benefit from this enlargement of available 
structures we updated our fragment database. 
Fragment-based tools such as <rs type="software">SuperLooper</rs> depend on 
databases too large to distribute as stand-alone programs 
(∼80 GB in the case of <rs type="software">SL2</rs>). The rapid delivery of a large 
number of possible loop conformation makes web-based 
tools a perfect candidate. The database remains on a server 
and the user is able to choose a suitable loop from listed re-
sults using a web-based molecule viewer. Here, we use <rs type="software">NGL</rs> 
(20) for protein and fragment visualization, which adopts 
capabilities of modern web browsers, such as <rs type="software">WebGL</rs> for 
molecular graphics. <rs type="software">NGL</rs> allows interactive display of even 
large molecular complexes and is unaffected by the retire-
ment of third-party plug-ins such as Flash or Java-Applets. 
This viewer offers comprehensive molecular visualization 
through a graphical user interface so that life scientists can 
easily access and utilize available structural data without 
any further installations (20). 
Thus, <rs type="software">SL2</rs> benefits from the significantly enlarged 
database of fragments and new fast molecule viewer. Due 
to the improved coverage of the conformational loop space, 
the quality of prediction, measured by the backbone root 
mean square deviation (RMSD), has improved by 20% on 
average compared to our previous version (17). The new 
version of our fragment-based web-application for loop 
modeling <rs type="software">SL2</rs> thus has an improved performance in loop 
prediction as well as an up-to-date visualization. </p>

<p>The loop database (LIP) is composed of all possible frag-
ments of 3-35 amino acids length extracted from the RSCB 
PDB entries in December 2015. Here, not only loops 
are considered but also fragments derived from secondary 
structure elements like helices and ␤-sheets. For each frag-
ment, the amino acid sequence, PDB identifier, chain iden-
tifier, residue number of stem atoms and a geometrical fin-
gerprint is stored. 
Geometrical fingerprint matching is used as a criterion to 
estimate the sterical fit of stem atoms of N-and C-termini 
of each database fragment to the C-and N-terminal stem 
atoms of a gap in a protein structure. The geometrical fin-
gerprints of both the stem atoms of each database fragment 
and the stem atoms of the gap are composed of the dis-
tance between the N-and C-terminal stem atoms and three 
angles defining their relative orientation (Figure 1). Com-
pared to our previous version, we slightly altered the geo-
metric fingerprint. Previously, we used a combination of two 
distances and two angles for scoring, resulting in a higher 
weighting of the fit of the residue where the angle was mea-
sured. In <rs type="software">SL2</rs>, we solved this problem employing distance 
and three angles. 
Since the first release of <rs type="software">SuperLooper</rs> in 2008, the num-
ber of entries deposited in the RSCB PDB has more than 
doubled from 54 543 structures to 114 693 in 2015. A total 
of 901 609 231 fragments with a length of 3 to 35 residues 
was extracted from this enlarged pool of template structures 
(Figure 2A). Because more short than long overlapping 
fragments are extracted from a given template structure, </p>

<p>mented that automatically adds novel fragments to the LIP 
or LIMP database every three months. 
Due to (partial) embedding into the lipid bilayer, loops 
of membrane proteins have a more hydrophobic amino 
acid composition compared to loops of globular proteins 
(21). Tools developed for the prediction of loops connect-
ing transmembrane helices were indeed found to enhance 
prediction of GPCR loops (22). In <rs type="software">SL2</rs>, such loops can be 
selected from LIMP, which is a collection of fragments ex-
tracted from loops of all helical transmembrane proteins. 
Loops were defined as parts without regular fold, thus also 
containing kinks, bulges or re-entrant loops (23). To allow 
selection of membrane protein loops taking the lipid bilayer 
into account, the extension of the lipid bilayer is indicated 
by two parallel planes (as described below). 
The number of membrane protein structures deposited in 
the RCSB PDB rose from 805 (in 2008) to 2298 (in 2015) ac-
cording to the Protein Data Bank of Transmembrane Pro-
teins (24). As a result, the loops stored in LIMP doubled 
from 179 580 to 378 839. For LIMP is composed mainly 
of loop structures, the length distribution differs from LIP 
where the fragments also include helical fragments and frag-
ments derived from ␤-sheets. In LIMP (Figure 2B), few loop 
templates are available for short loops of 3-5 amino acids 
in length. The number of loops stored in LIMP increases 
markedly to a maximum of 20 000 up to a length of 20 
residues before it decreases again. </p>

<p>For visual inspection of results, we employed the <rs type="software">NGL 
viewer</rs> which works without installation of additional plug-
ins (20). As a common graphical user interface for the 
<rs type="software">NGL viewer</rs> (Figure 3) the search mask and the results list 
were implemented within JavaScript. A protein structure 
uploaded via the file selection dialog is instantly loaded to 
the <rs type="software">NGL viewer</rs>. The stem residues of the gap in the protein 
model must either be typed into the according search field or </p>

<p>can be selected by clicking them in the <rs type="software">NGL viewer</rs>. The se-
quence of the missing segment must be typed or copied into 
the search mask. If the membrane protein-specific LIMP 
data base (Membrane DB) is not checked, the LIP data base 
will be searched. After the submission button is pressed, the 
search is started. Depending on the loop length, results are 
expected to appear after few seconds or up to half a minute 
in the results list. 
The top hit will automatically be loaded into the gap of 
the protein model depicted in the viewer window. Alterna-
tive loop conformations can be selected from the results ta-
ble containing the 100 best loop candidates. For each can-
didate, the score ranging from 0 to 0.455, the RCSB PDB 
entry-code and sequence of the template protein, the num-
ber of clashes, and the sequence identity between target and 
template are listed. If no appropriate loop is found, the 
user can select 'Decrease N-terminal stem' or 'Increase C-
terminal stem' to add a residue to the loop and shift the 
stem atoms of the gap, accordingly. As an additional vi-
sual control, for helical membrane proteins, the position 
of the lipid bilayer can be calculated ('Calculate membrane 
planes'), employing the web-service TMDET (25). 
There is an option to display the complete list of loop 
candidates at the same time as visualizing the conforma-
tion space of the loop. Loop candidates can be colored ac-
cording to score, sequence identity or clashes by selecting 
the corresponding color scheme from the dropdown menu. 
The completed structure (initial model plus selected loop) 
can be downloaded by clicking the download button. Al-
ternatively, the complete list of loops can be downloaded 
for further analysis. </p>

<p>Visualization is carried out by the <rs type="software">NGL viewer</rs> (20). To use 
the full feature set of the <rs type="software">NGL viewer</rs> an up-to-date web 
browser (tested on the recent versions of Firefox, Google 
Chrome, Safari, IE and Edge) is recommended. The spe-
cialized graphical user interface is written in JavaScript. For 
job handling a simple python job server based on the Flask 
framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/) is used. </p>

<p>The updated version of our fragment based web-application 
tool for loop modeling, <rs type="software">SL2</rs>, benefits from an enlarged frag-
ment database and a new user interface including an up-
dated protein viewer. As a result of the enlarged fragment 
database the prediction quality has been further improved. 
Using the same dataset (15) and validation procedure as in 
our previous publication (17), an average gain in prediction 
quality by 20% is observed for loops of 3-16 residues length 
(Figure 4). A drop of the backbone RMSD between ex-
perimentally determined and modeled loops (only the top 
hit was considered) starts to become evident for loops with 
eight residues length. This implies that the coverage of pos-
sible loop conformations has been further optimized start-
ing with this length. 
Despite the gain of prediction quality, the top hit results 
obtained by <rs type="software">SL2</rs> sometimes deviate from the experimentally 
determined structure even for short loops. There are several </p>

displayed as table on the right hand just below the search mask. </p>

bus) and updated version <rs type="software">SL2</rs> (gray star) using a standard loop dataset

<p>possible reasons for this. First, many loops are highly flexi-
ble or are even located in structurally disordered regions of 
proteins (26,27). The conformations suggested by <rs type="software">SL2</rs> may 
thus indicate alternative loop conformations not observed 
by protein X-ray structure crystallography (e.g. Figure S6 
in (28)). Second, as scoring of the loops mainly depends on 
the stem residues, experimentally caused distortions of these 
stem atoms may prevent selection of a specific conformation 
(29). Prediction quality drops with loop length, mainly due 
to the increased conformational space. A promising strategy 
to enhance prediction quality of longer loops would be in-</p>

<p>patient experience. Because the patient survey did not 
collect information on occupation, this could not be 
included in the model. The second model augmented 
this to include language spoken most often at home 
(hereafter referred to as 'language') to determine if the 
effect of ethnicity on the patient experience was partially 
attributed to language. Lastly, the third model included 
the model 1 variables, language and birthplace, dichoto-
mised as UK or non-UK. Language (English vs 
non-English speaking) and birthplace (UK vs non-UK) 
were binary variables in order to maximise the power. 
CIs and p values were based on bootstrapping clustered 
by practice with 500 repetitions to account for the 
skewed distribution of doctor-patient communication

<p>the 21 kainate-treated animals. Eight MRS-identified com-
pounds were used: NAA, Glu, Ins, Gln, GABA, Glc, and 
Lac, all taken as a ratio to total Cr. This exploratory multi-
variate approach uses the MRS data to define a linear dis-
tance between all possible pairs of animals, and then groups 
the animals according to their distance values into "agglom-
erative" clusters to minimize the variance of distances 
within any given cluster. These subgroups were then evalu-
ated for their group metabolic characteristics. To further 
validate the clustering process, a machine learning approach 
was used with all of the clustered animal data to indepen-
dently classify each animal using a leave-one-out analysis. 
As the definition of the clusters was determined by the MRS 
data, effectively all the spectroscopic data analysis was

focal microscope (LSM 510 Meta or LSM 710; Carl Zeiss) was used with an 
LD C-Apochromat 40×/1.1 W Corr objective (Carl Zeiss). Time lapses were 
done with a z total = 31 µm to leave space for z-drift. Time points were col-
lected at 5-min intervals. Subsets in the z-plane containing the cells of interest 
were selected for clarity. Collected time-lapse data were registered using

conducted with the software <rs id="software-3" type="software">z-Tree</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Fischbacher</rs> 
2007). An experimental session lasted for a bit 
less than 2 hours. Subjects earned an average of 
€22.05 (including a €4 show-up fee). </p>

<p>A total of 172 students (152 in the four 
main reporting treatments and 20 in the strat-
egy method treatment) participated in ten experi-
ment sessions in 2013 and 2014 at the University 
of Michigan. 17 Among them, 58.7% of subjects 
(101) were female. No subject participated in 
more than one session, and the sessions lasted 
about an hour on average, about half of this 
time being spent on reading of instructions and 
answering comprehension questions. The exper-
iment was programmed in <rs id="software-1" type="software">z-tree</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Fischbacher</rs> 
2007). All instructions (for the example of the 
LC treatment, see Supporting Information) were 
neutrally framed, avoiding terms such as "cooper-
ate," "trust," and so on. Subjects had to answer a 
number of control questions (see the instructions) 
to confirm their understanding of the experiment. 
Communication between subjects was not per-
mitted. Average earnings were $20.84, including 
a $5 participation fee, with a standard deviation 
of $4.16.

<p>retinal endothelial cells (HRECs; Cell Systems, Kirkland, 
WA). Briefly, 75 μl vitronectin (5 μg/ml; BD, Franklin Lakes, 
NJ) or fibronectin (10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich; concentrations 
showing best adhesion to HRECs) was incubated for 1 h at 
37 °C in 96-well microtiter plates. After excess ECM was 
removed from the wells, the uncoated area in the wells was 
blocked with 1% BSA. HRECs suspended at 10 
5 cells per ml 
in CSC medium (Cell Systems) containing 0.1% BSA were 
incubated for 30 min with antibodies for α5β1 (clone JBS5, 
EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) or αvβ3 (LM609, Millipore). 
Ten-microliter cell suspensions were inoculated into the 
ECM-coated wells. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the 
cells were fixed with 10% neutral formalin (Nacalai tesque) 
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich). 
The statistical test and variance is stated in figure legend.

<p>tied and filled with 3 ml of KRB without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-␤. 
After 3 min of in situ incubation, 3 ml of 60 mmol/l glucose solution were 
injected in the lumen to obtain a final concentration of 30 mmol/l. After a 
further 3 min, these loops were removed and opened along the mesenteric 
border and the mucosa was scraped off on ice with a glass blade. Total cell 
protein extracts and BBMs were prepared from the scrapings as previously 
described (23), and enrichment was estimated by determination of alkaline 
phosphatase activity (20-fold increase of activity in BBMs). Solubilized 
proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and 
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. The 
following rabbit antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution: SGLT-1 (AB 1352; 
Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), GLUT2, PKC ␤II (sc-9117, sc-210; 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu-Bio, France), phospho-AMPK-␣ (Thr172), 
AMPK-␣ (23A3), and phospho-PKC (pan (2531, 2603, 190D10; Cell Signaling 
Technology, Ozyme, France). The intensity of the specific immunoreactive 
bands was quantified using National Institutes of Health Image (Scion, 
Frederick, MD). 
Glucose uptake experiments. Uptake experiments were performed using 
rat intestinal everted rings as previously described (24). Groups of eight 
intestinal rings were incubated at 37°C for 15 min in oxygenized KRB buffer in 
the absence (control) and the presence of RELM-␤ (1 nmol/l) and cytochalasin 
B as indicated. Then the rings were incubated for 2 min in an uptake solution 
corresponding to a KRB buffer containing 30 mmol/l glucose and 0.1 Ci/ml of 
the isotopic tracer D-[1-
14 C] glucose. After adding the uptake solution, the 
rings were washed in ice-cold KRB solution, and radioactivity incorporated in 
the tissue was quantified by liquid scintillation. Data were not corrected for 
extracellular substrate because RELM-␤ was found not to affect paracellular 
diffusion. Total protein from homogenized tissue with a Dounce homogenizer 
was determined with bicinchoninic acid reagent from Pierce (Thermo Scien-
tific, Brebiè res, France). Results are expressed as micromoles glucose per 
gram of tissue protein. 
Chemicals. Recombinant murine RELM-␤ was purchased from PeproTech 
(Neuilly-sur-Seine, France). Antibody raised against RELM-␤ was a gift from 
Dr. Blagoy Blagoev (University of Southern Denmark). D-[1-
14 C] Mannitol was 
from GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences (les Ulis, France), D-[1-
14 C] 
glucose was from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA), and compound C from Merck 
Sharp &amp; Dohme-Chibret (Paris, France). All other chemical reagents were 
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 
Statistical analysis. All results were expressed as means Ϯ SE. One-way

<p>after cannulation of the ascending aorta, 5% Evans blue was 
injected into coronary arteries to stain nonischemic myocar-
dium. The LV was then harvested and sectioned into 5 to 7 
slices at a thickness of 0.7 mm from the apex to the base 
and then incubated in 1.5% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC 
in PBS, 30 minutes at 37°C). The nonischemic zone (blue 
area), myocardium-at-risk (nonstained area by Evans blue), 
and infarct zone (nonstained area by TTC) were outlined and 
areas quantified digitally using <rs type="software">Image J</rs> software. Since LV 
sections were at an equal thickness of 0.7 mm, volumes of 
myocardium-at-risk and infarct myocardium were also calcu-
lated by multiplying differently stained areas of each LV

<p>Data acquisition and analysis. Data were acquired and analysed using the 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">pClamp</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 8.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Axon Instruments</rs>). Currents were recorded 
from small cells ( &lt; 25 µm) using an Axopatch (200 series) patch clamp amplifier, 
filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. The series resistance was compensated 
(60-75%). 
Cells were depolarized to a variety of potentials ( − 80 to + 40 mV) from a 
holding potential of − 120 mV. The TTX-sensitive sodium current was determined 
as the current that was sensitive to block by 500 nM TTX and was obtained by 
digitally subtracting the TTX-resistant component from the total inward current. 
The current density was obtained by dividing the peak current by the cell capaci-
tance as read from the amplifier. Current densities were obtained by dividing the 
current at each potential by the cell capacitance as read from the amplifier. </p>

<p>Background: Automated insulin management features of the MiniMed 
Ò 640G sensor-augmented pump system 
include suspension in response to predicted low sensor glucose (SG) values (''suspend before low''), suspension 
in response to existing low SG values (''suspend on low''), and automatic restarting of basal insulin delivery 
upon SG recovery. The effectiveness of these features was evaluated using <rs type="software">CareLink</rs> 
Ò software data. 
Methods: Anonymized data from MiniMed 640G system users (n = 4818), MiniMed 530G system users 
(n = 39,219), and MiniMed Paradigm 
Ò VeoÔ system users (n = 43,193) who voluntarily uploaded pump and 
sensor data were retrospectively analyzed. Comparisons were made between days in which system features 
were enabled at any time and those in which they were not. Comparisons were also made between pump 
suspension events for which insulin delivery was automatically or manually resumed and between glycemic 
parameters of users who switched from the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system to the MiniMed 640G system. 
Results: Days in which the MiniMed 640G ''suspend before low'' feature was enabled had lower percentages of 
SG readings £70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or  ‡240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) than days when it was not enabled 
(P &lt; 0.001 for each). Users who switched from the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system to the MiniMed 640G 
system had fewer excursions below £70 mg/dL (P &lt; 0.001) and  ‡240 mg/dL (P &lt; 0.001). SG values following 
automatically resumed pump suspension events recovered more rapidly and had a more stabilized endpoint than 
following manually resumed events. 
Conclusions: Automated insulin management features of the MiniMed 640G system can reduce the frequency 
of both high and low SG values and help stabilize SG after resumption of insulin delivery. </p>

<p>SG value is predicted to reach or fall below a preset low limit 
within 30 min. Similar to the MiniMed Paradigm Veo and 
MiniMed 530G systems, basal insulin delivery can be man-
ually resumed at any time during a suspend event and auto-
matically resumes after 2 hours. In contrast, ''auto-resume'' 
can occur sooner if, at 30 min since the start of pump sus-
pension, the SG value is above the low limit and predicted to 
remain above the low limit within 30 min. 
<rs type="software">CareLink</rs> 
Ò Personal Therapy Management Software for 
diabetes provides remote storage and retrospective analysis 
capabilities of data from the pump, sensor, and blood glucose 
meter. 
10 <rs type="software">CareLink</rs> software data from individual users can be 
reviewed in collaboration with healthcare providers to guide 
therapy adjustments, or can be aggregated and analyzed to 
detect large-scale patterns and outcomes in an anonymized 
manner. The effectiveness and usage patterns of the automated 
insulin management features of the MiniMed 640G system, in 
addition to specific MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 
530G comparator data, were evaluated. </p>

<p>Anonymized <rs type="software">CareLink</rs> data, voluntarily uploaded from 
4818 individuals using the MiniMed 640G system between 
January 13, 2015, and January 14, 2016 (286,149 user-days 
of data); 39,219 individuals using MiniMed 530G system 
between October 15, 2013, and June 25, 2015 (2,777,117 
user-days of data); and 43,193 individuals using the MiniMed 
Paradigm Veo system between October 1, 2011, and July 14, 
2015 (4,101,706 user-days of data); were analyzed. Users of 
each system uploaded, at least, 5 days of <rs type="software">CareLink</rs> data 
during the aforementioned time periods. The aforementioned 
data included information on insulin delivery from the pumps 
and information from CGM sensors (Enlite 
Ò sensor [Mini-
Med 530G system] and Enhanced Enlite 
Ò sensor [MiniMed 
Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 640G systems]; Medtronic). 
For this retrospective analysis, users were not provided 
specific instruction from healthcare professionals on when or 
how long to use system features or how often to calibrate 
systems with self-monitored blood glucose measurements. 
Voluntarily uploaded and anonymized data were captured 
from <rs type="software">CareLink</rs> software. To compare SG trajectories associ-
ated with different types of pump suspension, user-days were </p>

<p>The hypoglycemia prevention attributable to the MiniMed 
640G system was also measured in a recent Predictive Low 
Glucose Management (PLGM) pivotal study, 
14 in which 
standardized increases in basal insulin delivery were used to 
trigger insulin pump suspension. A 60% reduction in hypo-
glycemia was reported based on 68 automatic pump-
suspension events, among which the hypoglycemic criterion 
(two or more reference plasma glucose levels of &lt;65 mg/dL) 
did not occur in 41 cases. This is less than the 75% prevention 
rate reported here and the 83% prevention rate reported in a 
PLGM user evaluation study. 
8 The smaller reduction ob-
served in the pivotal study was likely due to the basal insulin 
delivery escalation protocol known to result in hypoglycemia 
93% of the time, 
15 relative to the day-to-day environment 
settings of the later studies. 
In the present study data, the MiniMed 640G algorithm 
governing automatic resumption of insulin delivery based on 
SG appeared to work well and resumed insulin delivery 
primarily within 30-45 min after pump suspension. While 
more than half of manually resumed events occurred within 
the first 15 min after pump suspension for the MiniMed 
Paradigm Veo or MiniMed 530G systems, only one-third 
occurred within the same period for MiniMed 640G. It is not 
known what user characteristics or physiologic and metabolic 
factors may have influenced the different extent of manual 
resumption between the systems. The ''auto resume'' based 
on SG feature, not available in MiniMed Paradigm Veo or 
MiniMed 530G systems, appeared to allow a more immediate 
real-time solution for maintaining target glucose levels. 
Specifically, there was a faster hypoglycemia recovery and 
less glycemic variability (as measured by the CV of SG 
values), compared to users who restart the pump manually. 
This study benefits from the large number of users and 
user-days available for analyses, although data from system 
users who did not upload to <rs type="software">CareLink</rs> software were un-
available. A limitation of the study is that the MiniMed 
640G ''suspend on low'' versus MiniMed 640G ''suspend 
before low'' data could not be analyzed, due to an insuffi-
cient number of events during use of the former feature. The 
lack of detailed user demographic information is another 
limitation, as is a lack of detailed information regarding 
user-system interface (e.g., calibrations, sensor changes, </p>

at 4°C. Membranes were washed three times in TBS-T and in-
cubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary

Continuous variables were compared using t-test (comparison 
of two groups) and ANOVA (comparison of 3 or more groups). 
If data distributions were skewed, a non-parametric test was 
used for comparison. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered sta-

<p>Fluorescence polarization measurements were carried out 
at 25 
• C on a Synergy 4 Microplate Reader (BioTek) as de-
scribed (38). A 5 nM of FAM-labeled double strand DNA 
was incubated for 10 min with increasing amounts of pro-
teins (up to 1 M) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. 
No change in fluorescence intensity was observed with 
the addition of protein. Curves were fit individually using 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">GraphPad PRISM</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">5.0d</rs> software. Binding constants (K D ) 
were calculated as [mP] = [maximum mP] x [C] / (K D +[C]) 
+ [baseline mP], where [mP] is milli-Polarization and [C] is 
protein concentration (39). Saturated [mP] was calculated 
as saturation = ([mP] − [baseline mP])/([maximum mP] − 
[baseline mP]). Curves were normalized as percentage of 
bound and reported is the mean ± SEM of the interpolated 
K D from two independent experiments performed in dupli-
cate. For those binding curves that did not reach saturation, 
the lower limit of the binding affinity was estimated (39). </p>

<p>For co-crystallization, 1 mM MAX purified protein was 
mixed with 0.5 mM double-stranded oligonucleotide with 
nine different DNAs (Supplementary Figure S2). The best 
diffracting crystal used for data collection was obtained 
from 5 -AGTAGCAXGTGCTACT-3 (where X = 5caC) 
(synthesized by New England Biolabs). Crystals appeared 
within 1-day under the conditions of 0.1 M sodium citrate-
citric acid at pH 5.5, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000. 
Crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in mother liquor 
supplemented with 30% ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction 
datasets were collected at the SER-CAT beamline (22ID-D) 
at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Lab-
oratory and processed using XDS (40). The structure was 
solved by molecular replacement by <rs type="software">PHENIX</rs> (41,42) us-
ing the Max-DNA complex structure (PDB 1AN2 (43)) as 
a search model. <rs type="software">PHENIX</rs> refinement scripts were used for

interrogated for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 
structural variants in the MAX locus (https://research.

were extracted for those patients harboring MAX vari-
ants and compared to those for whom MAX status could 
be definitively called but whom lacked MAX SNVs (wild-

<p>Overdenture housings were duplicated with putty type 
impression material (Silagum Putty soft, DMG, Hamburg, 
Germany) as duplicating molds. Self-curing resin was mixed 
according to manufacturer's instruction, poured into fabri-
cated mold, and polymerized under 3 bar (43.5 psi), 55°C, 
for 30 minutes. Four connecting holes for stainless steel volt 
(2.0 mm diameter, 7.0 mm length) were formed on the sur-
face of overdenture housing. Ten samples were used in each 
group and a total of 20 samples were fabricated. 
Keeper screws were installed on the implant fixture by 
torque of 20 N, and mounting ring was mounted on the 
keeper. Magnetic attachment was placed on the keeper and 
fixed to the overdenture housing by self-curing resin. Venting 
hole was formed on overdenture housing. 
Three directions of tensile force, vertical, oblique and 
anterior-posterior, were applied to measure retentive force. 
Metal framework was seated on the mandibular model fixed 
to Instron testing machine (Model 3344, Instron Co., 
Norwood, MA, USA). Overdenture housing with magnetic 
attachment was connected to the framework by stainless-
steel volts and nuts. Four 16.00 cm Stainless-steel metal 
chains were mounted on upper jig of Instron by custom-
fabricated molds, and 2 of the metal chains were connected 
to the loops placed on buccal and lingual side of midline 
and another 2 chains to the loops placed on the first molar 
area. All chains were adjusted to achieve tight connection. 
Tensile test was performed at a cross-head speed of 50.0 
mm/min, the dislodging speed of denture from ridge, to 
measure retentive force. Overdenture samples were tested 
10 times with 3 different directions, a total of 30 times on 
each sample. The retentive forces were determined and 
recorded. 
Statistical analysis was performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">IBM SPSS Statistics</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v. 22.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). The mean and the 
standard deviation of each group were calculated. All data 
were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test to check for sig-
nificant differences among the groups. Wilcoxon signed-
rank tests were also used to analyze the effects of the direc-
tion of the dislodging force within the groups. All analyses 
were performed at 95% level of confidence (α = .05). </p>

<p>1. Design oligos for the plasmid backbone (subcloning plasmid) and the selectable marker (insertion cassette). Design each oligo such that 
it contains 180 bp HA flanking the genomic target site and 20 bp of specific priming sequence of the insertion cassette or the subcloning 
plasmid (Figure 2). 
NOTE: Homology arms should not contain any repetitive elements, presence of repetitive elements will result in incorrect targeting and 
subcloning. Repetitive elements can be detected by using web based tools such as the ''Repeat Masker''. 
2. Include a unique restriction enzyme (RE) site on one of the vector oligos to linearize the gene targeting vector for ES cell targeting (Figure 2). 
3. Check oligo parameters using an <rs type="software">oligo analyzer</rs> program. Take care to avoid secondary structures in the priming regions. 
4. Shorter HA (50 bp) of the insertion cassette is tolerated and yields lower number of recombinants but ensure that the subcloning plasmid HA 
is always longer (180 bp). 
5. Determine the orientation of the genomic DNA insert of the particular BAC clone using web based tools like ''<rs type="software">cloneDB</rs>''. Establish the direction 
of replication from OriS by checking the map of the BAC plasmid backbone used in the BAC library construction. 
NOTE: OriS is usually opposite to the transcriptional direction of the Chloramphenicol (Chl) marker for all commonly used BAC plasmids. 
6. Add two terminal phosphorothioate (PTO) bonds to the 5' end of the oligo that is opposite to the direction of replication on the BAC clone. Add 
a 5' phosphate modification to the reverse oligo (Figure 2). 
NOTE: The asymmetric phosphorothioated PCR cassette upon Red digestion generates an ssDNA intermediate that can prime the lagging 
strand of the replication fork. 
NOTE: Maximal multiplex recombination frequency is observed with the lagging strand protected cassettes. Leading strand protected or dual 
protected cassettes may not produce equivalent recombination efficiencies at some loci. 
7. Order oligos with PAGE or HPLC purification. </p>

first compared between the English and Spanish surveys. We 
analyzed differences between language groups as categorical 
variables using a Chi-squared test. When the assumptions of 
the Chi-squared test were not met, a Fisher's exact test was 
used. For this analysis, questions 1 and 20-24 were analyzed 
as continuous variables and compared between language 
groups using a two-sample t-test. Because 47 comparisons 
were made, we used a significance threshold of p&lt;0.0001 for 
all comparisons. 
No significant differences were noted between English 
and Spanish language survey responses except for race/ 
ethnicity (See Results). As a result, in subsequent analysis, 
responses from English and Spanish surveys were combined 
and analyzed as a single group. We compared the responses to 
questions 20-24 using analysis of variance with the question 
as a categorical predictor and the response as a continuous 
outcome. Questions 14 and 28 were compared on the log-scale 
using two-sample t-tests and then the results were converted 
back to a normal scale due to highly skewed results. The 
results for these items are presented as the geometric mean 
and a 95% confidence interval. We omitted responses with a 
value of 0 from this portion of the analysis. 
Finally, we made comparisons between racial/ethnic 
groups for questions 5, 10, 16, and 25. Native American and </p>

Cruz), Bcl-2 (1:200, Santa Cruz) and GAPDH (1:500, Santa 
Cruz), respectively overnight at 4°C. After incubation for 
2 hours with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary 
antibodies, the reaction was visualized using an enhanced 
chemiluminescence kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The 
integrated optical density (mean intensity × area) of proteins 
was quantified using <rs type="software">Image-Pro Plus</rs>. The relative level 
of analyzed protein expression was normalized to that of 
GAPDH. </p>

<p>Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate and 
cardiomyocytes were pooled from three to four different rat 
litters. Our data from three to four experiments was pooled 
and analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 13.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA</rs>); data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. 
Differences observed between the two groups were analyzed 
by two-sample t-tests for independent samples and among 
groups by one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls 
posttest analysis. A P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. </p>

<p>All primers for E2F-1 target genes were

(<rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">Version 20.0</rs>). According to the cross over 
design, the mean breath scores, plaque and gingival scores 
were compared within the groups using Paired sample t test 
and between the groups applying the ANOVA (Analysis 
of variance) with Post hoc Tukey's test. The relationship 
between the plaque scores and gingival scores day 1 and

<p>The zeta potential gives an indication of the charge acquired 
by a particulate system on its suspension in aqueous medium. 
The zeta potential of the nanoparticles was determined using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">DTS software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Malvern Instruments Limited, Malvern, UK</rs>) based on M3-PALS technology. The concentration 
of the AmB−PGA formulation used was 10 
-4 M. Particle 
size was determined by photon correlation spectroscopy 
(90Plus/BI-MAS, Brookhaven Instruments, Holtville, NY, 
USA). Samples were filtered using a 0.22 µm syringe filter 
(polyethersulfone, Millipore) to remove contamination with 
dust particles. Dynamic light scattering measurements were 
carried out using DynaPro-TC-04 equipment (Protein Solu-
tions, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) equipped 
with a temperature-controlled microsampler. The size and 
surface morphology of the AmB-loaded nanoparticles were 
characterized using an electron microscope (CM-10, Philips, 
Hamburg, Germany). For transmission electron microscopy 
studies, the AmB−PGA formulation was used at a concen-
tration of 10 µg/mL AmB equivalents in double-distilled 
water. The details of these procedures are provided in the 
Supplementary materials section. </p>

<p>In order to assess the statistical differences among various 
groups, the data were analyzed using the Student's t-test 
and one way analysis of variance (Holm-Sidak method), 
using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Sigma-Plot</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 10</rs> software. P-values &lt;0.05 were 
considered to be statistically significant. </p>

<p>The zeta potential of the nanoparticles was determined using 
<rs id="software-2" type="software">DTS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Malvern Instruments Limited, Malvern, UK</rs>) based on M3-PALS technology. Samples were filtered 
using a 0.22 µm polyethersulfone syringe filter (Millipore, 
Bangalore, India) to remove contamination with dust 
particles. The formulation was lyophilized in a 2.0 mL 
microfuge tube and the samples were reconstituted in 20 
mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). This dispersion was then 
rapidly dispensed to an electrophoresis cell to measure the 
electrophoretic mobility, and zeta potential values were 
calculated. The concentration of the AmB−PGA formula-
tion used was 10 
-4 M. The experiments were repeated three 
times and the average zeta potential and standard deviations </p>

<p>Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out 
using DynaPro-TC-04 equipment (Protein Solutions, 
Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) equipped 
with a temperature-controlled microsampler. The PGA 
nanoparticles (2 mg/mL) were filtered serially through 
0.22 µm and 0.02 µm Whatman syringe filters directly into a 
12 µL quartz cuvette. For each experiment, 20 measurements 
were taken. Mean hydrodynamic radius (R h ) was analyzed 
using <rs type="software">Dynamics software</rs> at optimized resolution. The R h was 
estimated on the basis of an autocorrelation analysis of </p>

<p>odd ratios (OR) were reported. Univariate and multivariate 
analyses were performed for the logistic regressions. All 
statistical analyses were conducted using statistical soft-
ware (SPSS Inc., version 21, Chicago, IL and <rs id="software-1" type="software">Stata</rs> software, 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">version 12</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">StataCorp</rs>, Texas, US). The significant levels in all 
analyses were considered to be 0.05. </p>

<p>We used discrete-time hazard models and a 
complementary loglog (cloglog) specification; 
unlike logit or probit, cloglog has a response 
curve that is asymmetric (Box-Steffensmeier and 
Jones 2004; Jenkins 1995; Singer and Willett 
1993). One advantage of duration or survival 
models is their ability to take into account obser-
vations that are censored (in our case, individuals 
who have not yet started smoking at interview). 
Discrete-time hazard models have been used 
fairly extensively to examine the effect of prices 
on smoking onset (for recent examples, see Etile 
and Jones 2011; Guindon 2014a; Nonnemaker 
and Farrelly 2011). As a functional form for the 
baseline hazard function, we used a cubic poly-
nomial specification. As a sensitivity check, we 
also used a more flexible approach and used a 
dummy specification for time at risk, measured in 
years. An even more flexible approach would use 
a dummy specification for time at risk measured 
in months. Such an approach, however, requires 
the inclusion of a large number of unknown 
parameters, is computationally demanding, and is 
fraught with convergence problems. 
Standard survival/duration models assume 
that the probability of eventual failure is greater 
than zero for all individuals (Boag 1949; Forster 
and Jones 2001; Schmidt and Witte 1989). Given 
that a large proportion of individuals never start 
smoking, we also used discrete time split popu-
lation models. 4 All models were estimated using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Stata/MP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">14.1</rs> with sampling weights. Split 
population models were estimated using spsurv 
developed by Jenkins without sampling weights. 5 
Finally, we conducted a number of sensi-
tivity checks to ensure that our main results 
were not sensitive to alternative specifications. </p>
