<p>OBJECTIVEdThe purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the dose-
response effect of fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake on insulin resistance (IR) in people who are 
overweight and at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdA total of 105 participants (mean age 56 
years) followed a 4-week washout diet (one to two portions of F&amp;Vs per day). Ninety-two 
participants completed the washout and were randomized to receive one to two, four, 
or seven portions of F&amp;Vs per day for 12 weeks. IR was assessed at the start and end of this 
12-week period by the two-step euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Compliance 
was monitored using a combination of 4-day food diaries and plasma biomarkers of F&amp;V 
intake. </p>

<p>RESULTSdA total of 89 participants completed the study. Participants attained self-reported 
F&amp;V intakes of 1.8, 3.8, and 7.0 portions per day (P , 0.001) per group. There was a significant 
linear increase in serum lutein status across the groups, indicating good compliance (P , 0.001), 
and body weight was maintained (P = 0.77). No significant difference was found between 
groups in terms of a change in measures of whole-body, peripheral, or hepatic IR or adiponectin 
multimers. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdIncreased consumption of F&amp;Vs, as advocated in public-health advice, 
has no effect on IR in overweight individuals who are at high risk of CVD when body weight is 
maintained. Recent evidence from systematic reviews indicates that particular classes or types of 
F&amp;Vs may have particular antidiabetic properties; hence, it is possible that benefits may only be 
observed in response to a more specific fruit or vegetable intervention. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODS </p>

<p>Study overview 
Ethics approval for this randomized con-
trolled trial (RCT) was received from the 
Office for Research Ethics Committees 
Northern Ireland, and the study proto-
col was registered (ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT00874341). The study used a 4-week 
washout period to minimize pretrial bio-
chemical and/or physiological disparities. 
After the washout phase, participants were 
informed of their allocation to one of the 
following three F&amp;V groups for 12 weeks: 
one to two, four, or seven portions of 
F&amp;Vs each day. The primary end point, 
IR, was measured using the two-step 
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp tech-
nique at week 4 and week 16 (preinterven-
tion and postintervention). </p>

<p>Participant recruitment and 
screening 
Between April 2009 and February 2011, 
participants were recruited from the gen-
eral population via press release, by in-
tranet advertisements within Belfast 
Health and Social Care Trust and Queen's 
University Belfast, and from hospital out-
patient clinics. Interested participants 
were screened for eligibility. The inclu-
sion criteria were as follows: CVD risk of 
$20% over 10 years, as defined by Joint 
British Societies' guidelines on the preven-
tion of CVD in clinical practice (12); BMI 
$27 and #35 kg/m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>; and habitual F&amp;V 
intake of two or fewer portions per day. 
The exclusion criteria were as follows: di-
abetes mellitus; established CVD; surgery 
within the previous 3 months; aspirin use; 
psychiatric problems; taking medication 
known to affect nutrient metabolism; preg-
nant or lactating; excessive alcohol con-
sumption; taking antioxidant supplements; 
food sensitivities that would interfere with a 
tolerance to F&amp;Vs; medical conditions or 
dietary restrictions that would substantially 
limit the ability to complete the study re-
quirements; following a weight loss diet; un-
willingness or inability to modify current 
diet; and women of childbearing age not 
taking the contraceptive pill. </p>

<p>Washout phase (week 0-4) 
After eligibility was confirmed and writ-
ten informed consent was obtained, all 
participants commenced the washout and 
were asked to consume less than two 
portions of F&amp;Vs per day for 4 weeks. 
Participants were given an information 
booklet to ensure that they understood </p>

<p>the requirement to consume less than 
two portions of F&amp;Vs per day and the 
definition of what constitutes a portion 
of F&amp;Vs, as defined by the U.K. Depart-
ment of Health (13) (i.e., an 80-g serving: 
one apple or banana, 150 mL fruit juice or 
3 heaping tablespoons of vegetables). </p>

<p>Intervention phase (week 4-16) 
Participants were randomized at study 
entry and were informed of their random-
ization allocation at week 4 (i.e., after they 
had completed the washout period). A 
computer-generated randomization list 
was used to allocate participants to one 
of the following three intervention groups: 
one to two, four, or seven portions of F&amp;Vs 
per day; owing to the nature of the inter-
vention it was not possible to blind partic-
ipants to their allocation. All participants 
were provided with written dietary advice 
specific to their allocated F&amp;V group, 
which detailed portion sizes of F&amp;Vs and 
provided guidance on cooking and storage, 
as well as recipe suggestions and general 
tips on eating more F&amp;Vs. Participants in 
the four-and seven-portion groups were 
provided with individualized advice on 
ways to incorporate F&amp;Vs into daily meals, 
taking into consideration normal meal/ 
snack patterns, habitual F&amp;V likes and 
dislikes, and any identified barriers/ 
constraints to F&amp;V consumption. In or-
der to encourage compliance, partici-
pants received a weekly home delivery 
of F&amp;Vs from a major retailer for the du-
ration of the intervention. The study re-
searcher telephoned participants on a 
weekly basis in order to discuss their 
F&amp;V order, monitor compliance and 
body weight, and discuss any individual 
difficulties with adherence to the proto-
col. In line with public health advice, par-
ticipants were encouraged to consume 
as wide a variety of F&amp;Vs as possible. 
Compliance was monitored using a com-
bination of self-reported dietary intake 
(4-day food diaries at weeks 0, 4, and 
16; at least four unannounced 24-h re-
calls during the intervention period; and 
daily F&amp;V records) and biochemical as-
sessment of nutritional status, as de-
scribed below. 
F&amp;V portions consumed by each par-
ticipant at the three time points during the 
intervention (weeks 0, 4, and 16) were 
hand counted independently by two re-
searchers from the 4-day food diaries, and 
any discrepancies were assessed and re-
solved with input from a third researcher. 
A portion was as defined by the U.K. De-
partment of Health (13). </p>

<p>Study assessments 
Assessments were carried out at the Re-
gional Centre for Endocrinology and Di-
abetes, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. A 
medical/lifestyle questionnaire and a 
physical activity questionnaire were ad-
ministered at weeks 0 and 16 (14). 
Height, weight, and waist and hip 
circumferences were measured at weeks 
0, 4, and 16. Body composition was mea-
sured using a whole-body dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry scan at weeks 4 and 
16. All scans were performed by a trained 
radiographer using a Lunar Prodigy Pro 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner 
(GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI). Blood 
pressure at week 4 was measured using an 
oscillometric Meditech ABPM-04 ambu-
latory BP system [P.M.S. (Instruments) Ltd, 
Berkshire, U.K.]. 
A two-step euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic 
clamp combined with the infusion of 
[3-
3 H]glucose was carried out at weeks 
4 and 16 by I.R.W., who was blinded to 
group allocation, as previously described 
(15,16). After cannula insertion, a primed 
continuous infusion of high-performance 
liquid chromatography-purified [3-
3 H] 
glucose was administered during a 2-h 
equilibration period (2120 min to zero 
time). Arterialized venous blood was 
used for all analyses in the clamp studies. 
Plasma for the measurement of glucose-
specific activity was deproteinized with 
barium hydroxide and zinc sulfate using 
the method of Somogyi (17). Aliquots of 
tracer infusate and labeled exogenous glu-
cose infusion were spiked into nonradio-
active plasma and processed in parallel to 
allow the calculation of [3-</p>

<p>3 </p>

<p>H]glucose in-
fusion rates (GIRs). IR was assessed using 
the exogenous GIR required to maintain 
euglycemia corrected for body weight and 
for fat-free body mass. The isotope-dilution 
method was used to allow the measure-
ment of endogenous glucose production 
(EGP), the rate of appearance of glucose in 
the peripheral circulation (Ra), and the 
rate of disappearance or whole body up-
take of glucose (Rd). 
Indirect calorimetry was performed 
alongside the two-step clamp at weeks 4 
and 16. An open-circuit indirect calorim-
eter (GEMNutrition Ltd., Daresbury, 
U.K.) with a ventilated canopy hood was 
used to measure minute-by-minute oxy-
gen consumption and carbon dioxide 
production. Resting energy expenditure 
was measured during the last 45 min of 
the calibration period (245 min to zero 
time), after participants rested for a min-
imum of 75 min. Energy expenditure was </p>

<p>also measured during the final stages of 
the low-dose insulin infusion (90-120 
min) and the high-dose insulin infusion 
(210-240 min). Insulin-induced thermo-
genesis during the low-dose and high-
dose insulin infusions was calculated as 
the difference between energy expendi-
ture measured during each insulin infu-
sion and the resting energy expenditure 
(18). Change in the respiratory quotient 
(RQ), calculated as the RQ during the 
high-dose insulin infusion minus the rest-
ing RQ (19), was used as an indicator of 
metabolic flexibility. </p>

<p>Laboratory analysis 
A fasting blood sample was collected at 
weeks 0, 4, and 16. All samples were 
processed and stored at 2808C within 2 h 
of collection. All laboratory analyses were 
blinded. Plasma ascorbic acid concentra-
tions were determined according to the 
method described by Vuilleumier and 
Keck (20). Serum concentrations of 
lutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin, 
a-carotene, b-carotene, and lycopene 
were measured by high-performance liq-
uid chromatography with diode array de-
tection, as described by Craft et al. (21). 
Assays were standardized against appropri-
ate National Institute of Standards and 
Technology control materials. The fasting 
serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, 
and triglycerides) was assessed using enzy-
matic colorimetric assays (Roche Diagnos-
tics Limited, West Sussex, U.K.) on the 
ILab-600 biochemical analyzer (Instru-
mentation Laboratory, Warrington, U.K.). 
LDL cholesterol was calculated using a 
standard Friedewald equation (22). Plasma 
adiponectin (total, high-molecular weight, 
medium-molecular weight, and low-
molecular weight) were measured by 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">ELISA</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">ALPCO</rs> diagnostics); low-molecular 
weight adiponectin was obtained by sub-
tracting the combined concentration of 
medium-molecular weight and high-
molecular weight adiponectin (measured 
directly) from the total adiponectin con-
centration. Serum insulin levels were mea-
sured by <rs id="software-1" type="software">ELISA</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Abbot IMx</rs>; Abbott 
Laboratories, Berkshire, U.K.). Plasma 
glucose levels were measured using an au-
tomated glucose oxidase method using a 
Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2. Fasting glu-
cose and insulin levels were used to calcu-
late the HOMA score (23). Commercial 
kits were used to measure C-peptide 
(Dako UK Ltd, Ely, U.K.) and nonesterified 
fatty acids (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, 
Germany) on the ILab-600 biochemical 
analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory). </p>

<p>Statistical methods 
All statistical analyses were carried out 
using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> for Windows <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 17.0</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SPSS, Inc</rs>, Chicago, IL). Normally dis-
tributed continuous variables were sum-
marized using the mean and SD. Skewed 
variables were log-transformed for para-
metric analysis and summarized using the 
geometric mean and interquartile range. 
A one-way ANOVA test, or x 
2 test, was 
used to compare the three groups at base-
line for continuous and categorical varia-
bles, respectively. One-way ANOVA with 
linear trend test was used to examine dif-
ferences in mean change (i.e., preinter-
vention value minus postintervention 
value for a given continuous variable) be-
tween groups for the primary and second-
ary end points. Post hoc analyses were 
performed using the Dunnett test com-
paring the control group (one to two por-
tions) with the intervention groups (four 
and seven portions). For each variable, 
intervention analysis was performed for 
all participants who had completed the 
study protocol according to randomiza-
tion group. The test for linear trend 
(with changes in variable and portion al-
location as the dependent and indepen-
dent variables, respectively), analogous to 
linear regression, was incorporated in or-
der to take account of the dose-response 
design. Variables that were not normally 
distributed were log-transformed prior to 
these analyses. A sample size of 30 patients 
per group gave the study 80% power to 
detect a 10% difference in GIR between 
groups at a 5% level of significance (15,16). </p>

<p>RESULTSdSummary of participant re-
cruitment and flow through the interven-
tion (Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, 150 
individuals were screened for eligibility, 
and 45 did not meet study eligibility cri-
teria. A total of 105 participants com-
menced the 4-week washout period of 
the study (weeks 0-4). There were 13 
dropouts (12.4%) between weeks 0 and 
4 (reasons are indicated in Supplementary 
Fig. 1). A total of 92 participants pro-
ceeded to the intervention phase of the 
study (weeks 4-16), and 89 participants 
completed the 16-week protocol. There 
were three dropouts between weeks 4 and 
16: one from the group receiving one to two 
F&amp;V portions per day and two from the 
group receiving four F&amp;V portions per 
day, all owing to illness unrelated to the in-
tervention. The intervention was imple-
mented as intended, and there were no 
adverse events associated with the inter-
vention. Of the 105 eligible participants </p>

<p>who consented to join the study (n = 
105) at week 0, 64% were male (n = 61), 
two-thirds were obese (n = 67), and one-
third were overweight (n = 38). </p>

<p>Washout phase (week 0-4) 
The washout phase resulted in a statisti-
cally significant lowering in F&amp;V intake 
from a mean of 2.4 (SD 1.11) portions per 
day at week 0 to a mean of 1.6 (SD 0.85) 
portions per day at week 4 (P , 0.001; 
independent-samples t test; data not 
shown). These changes were accompanied 
by a statistically significant decrease in 
plasma vitamin C, lutein, b-cryptoxanthin, 
and a-carotene status (P , 0.05; 
independent-samples t test; data not 
shown). </p>

<p>Intervention phase (week 4-16) 
The baseline characteristics of all partic-
ipants who completed the washout and 
commenced the intervention (n = 92) at 
week 4 are presented in Supplementary 
Table 1. There were no statistically signif-
icant differences between the groups at 
the start of the intervention. The majority 
of participants (72%) were categorized as 
inactive or moderately inactive, 18% as 
moderately active, and 10% as active. 
The goal of maintaining body weight dur-
ing the study was achieved; there were no 
statistically significant mean differences 
in change in body weight or body compo-
sition (data not shown) among the groups 
receiving one to two, four, and seven F&amp;V 
portions, respectively, as follows: 0.41% 
change in body weight (95% CI 20.29 to 
1.12); 0.58 (20.01 to 1.17); 0.33 (20.20 
to 0.85) (P = 0.82, one-way ANOVA). 
There was no significant change in physical 
activity within or among groups during the 
study (data not shown). 
F&amp;V intake and micronutrient status. 
There was a statistically significant linear 
change in daily F&amp;V consumption among 
the three groups (Table 1), based on self-
reported F&amp;V intake calculated from 4-day 
food diaries. Participants in the groups re-
ceiving one to two, four, and seven por-
tions per day attained self-reported F&amp;V 
intakes of 1.8, 3.8, and 7.0 portions per 
day, respectively; this represented no sig-
nificant change in the two-portion group 
and a statistically significant increase in 
F&amp;V intake of 2.1 and 5.5 portions per 
day within the groups receiving four and 
seven portions per day, respectively (P , 
0.0001, paired-samples t test). There was a 
statistically significant linear increase in lu-
tein status with increasing F&amp;V intake, 
and a nonsignificant trend for increasing </p>

<p>vitamin C and b-carotene status (Table 2). 
The relative proportion of fruit versus veg-
etables to total F&amp;V intake during the in-
tervention was as follows: two portions per 
day: 43% fruit, 57% vegetables; four por-
tions per day: 64% fruit, 36% vegetables; 
and seven portions per day: 69% fruit, 31% 
vegetables. Based on the analysis of total 
food intake reported in 4-day food diaries 
at weeks 4 and 16, there was a statistically 
significant linear decrease in total fat intake 
and a statistically significant linear increase 
in total carbohydrate, sugar, and fiber in-
take with increasing F&amp;V intake (see Sup-
plementary Tables 4 and 5). 
Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp 
with indirect calorimetry and multi-
meric adiponectin. The changes in 
markers of IR are reported in Table 3. 
There was no changes in GIR or fasting 
plasma insulin or fasting glucose concen-
trations as a result of increased F&amp;V in-
take. The results for EGP, Ra, and Rd are 
summarized in Table 4; no statistically 
significant differences were observed in 
these parameters as a result of the dietary 
intervention. There was also no difference 
among groups in terms of the change in 
concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids 
or C-peptide (data not shown). There 
were no differences in the change in 
insulin-induced thermogenesis or RQ 
values among the groups (Supplementary 
Table 2). There were also no differences 
in the change in adiponectin multimer 
concentrations among the groups after 
the intervention (Supplementary Table 
3). Overall, there were no statistically sig-
nificant differences among the groups in 
measures of whole-body, peripheral, or 
hepatic IR, and there was no difference 
in the response to intervention according 
to sex (data not shown). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdCurrent dietary 
recommendations for F&amp;V consumption 
are based on observational evidence re-
garding the relationship between these 
foods and the risk of chronic disease. Re-
cently, data regarding the precise nature 
of their biological effects have started to 
emerge from RCTs (24). Such studies in 
both healthy and clinical groups are im-
portant in order to inform public health 
messages and evidence-based clinical 
practice. The RCT described here is the 
first to examine the cause-effect plausibil-
ity of a dose-response relationship be-
tween F&amp;V consumption and IR, 
assessed using the comprehensive glu-
cose clamp technique, in people at high 
risk of CVD. Despite objective evidence of </p>

<p>compliance with the intervention, in-
creased F&amp;V intake did not have a statis-
tically significant effect on whole-body, 
peripheral, or hepatic IR or concentra-
tions of adiponectin multimers. A favor-
able effect on microvascular function, 
assessed by venous occlusion plethys-
mography, has recently been demon-
strated in another dose-response F&amp;V 
intervention study (24). There is a recog-
nized reciprocal relationship between IR 
and endothelial dysfunction (25), and it 
could be hypothesized that the beneficial 
effects of F&amp;V on vascular function may 
be mediated by improvements in IR. The 
results of this RCT do not support this 
notion; furthermore, the change in vascu-
lar function in the aforementioned study 
did not correlate with the change in 
HOMA (26). Taken together, these results 
indicate that the beneficial effects of F&amp;Vs 
in relation to cardiovascular health are not 
likely to be directly mediated by IR. 
It is well-accepted, after the diabetes 
prevention trials, that weight loss can 
improve glucose tolerance and help to 
prevent type 2 diabetes (27,28); positive 
effects on body weight and overall dietary 
profile are recognized as one potential 
way in which F&amp;Vs may reduce the risk 
of chronic disease (29). In order to mini-
mize confounding and allow the specific 
effect of these whole foods to be studied, 
this study protocol aimed to increase 
F&amp;V intake while maintaining body 
weight, and this was achieved with no 
difference among groups in change in 
body weight. The lack of improvement 
in IR after increased F&amp;V intake lends 
support to the idea that weight loss may 
be more important than dietary composi-
tion in terms of influencing IR. It is pos-
sible that, independent of potential effects 
on body weight, F&amp;Vs may not have a 
direct effect on the risk of type 2 diabetes 
(29). However, it is also possible that 
F&amp;Vs may have subtle effects on IR, 
which are only detectable in a normal-
weight insulin-resistant group, or in 
overweight or obese populations after 
substantial weight loss has occurred. 
Moreover, although this study was con-
ducted in a population at high risk of 
CVD, the majority of participants did not 
have impaired fasting glucose levels, and 
the effects may be different in a group of 
participants with prediabetes. 
Displacement of less desirable foods, 
resulting in an improved dietary profile, 
has been discussed as a possible explana-
tion for the beneficial effect of F&amp;Vs 
on cardiovascular risk. In this study, </p>

<p>participants maintained their body 
weight, and this will have meant that 
they were substituting F&amp;Vs for other 
foods in the diet rather than adding 
F&amp;Vs to their usual dietary intake. The 
examination of overall dietary intake at 
weeks 4 and 16 indicated that the incor-
poration of F&amp;Vs into the diet in increas-
ing amounts was associated with a 
statistically significant linear decrease in 
fat intake and a statistically significant lin-
ear increase in total carbohydrate, sugar, 
and fiber intake amounts. F&amp;Vs are high 
in fiber, and fruit contains natural sugars; 
hence, these dietary changes were expected. 
The reduction in fat intake was mod-
est, and it is possible that the potential 
benefits of fat displacement on IR may 
have been negated by a more notable in-
crease in sugar intake. However, our pre-
vious research does not indicate that 
sugar intake at these levels has a detri-
mental effect on IR (15). The stipulation 
to maintain weight during the study was 
implemented in order to minimize con-
founding and to allow the direct effects of 
F&amp;V intake on IR to be studied. However, 
it means that this study cannot address 
the possibility that the incorporation of 
F&amp;Vs into the diet when no restrictions 
are placed on weight status may have a 
more pronounced effect on overall dietary 
profile, which, in turn, may affect IR. Fur-
thermore, findings from whole diet inter-
ventions support the notion that a 
combination of broad dietary changes 
may be an optimal approach (7-10). 
Furthermore, in order to be consis-
tent with public health advice about 
F&amp;Vs, this study did not restrict the types 
of F&amp;Vs consumed, and participants 
were allowed a free choice as would hap-
pen in a real-life setting. Thus, a more pre-
scriptive intervention that controls the 
types of F&amp;Vs more tightly and mini-
mizes within-group variation in chemical 
composition may provide a different an-
swer. Indeed, it has recently emerged 
from the literature that the type of fruit 
or vegetable may be important when it 
comes to influencing the risk of type 2 
diabetes. A recent meta-analysis of pro-
spective cohort studies suggested that an 
increase of 1.15 servings a day of dark-
green leafy vegetables is associated

<p>Fruit, vegetables, and insulin resistance </p>

<p>that were heterogeneous in their report-
ing of the data (some reported F&amp;Vs sep-
arately and combined, others only 
reported F&amp;Vs separately; there was also 
heterogeneity among studies in how 
"green leafy vegetables" were defined). A 
further, similar, meta-analysis published 
in 2012 (31) included data from the 
EPIC-InterAct prospective study and re-
ported estimates similar to those of Carter 
et al. (30) in relation to green leafy vege-
tables (relative risk [RR] 0.84 [95% CI 
0.74-0.94]). They also observed a weak 
association between total F&amp;V intake and 
diabetes risk when comparing the lowest 
and highest quartiles of F&amp;V intake (RR 
0.93 [95% CI 0.87-1.00]) (31). The 
EPIC-InterAct data also indicated an in-
verse association between root vegetables 
and diabetes risk (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.77-
0.99]); however, this association was not 
evident in two other studies in the meta-
analysis that examined this vegetable sub-
group (32,33). Alongside these data, a 
recent report from the prospective Nurses 
Health and Health Professionals Follow-Up 
Studies reported a lower risk of type 2 di-
abetes with higher intakes of anthocyanin-
rich foods, particularly blueberries and 
apples/pears (34). 
As well as F&amp;V quantity and subclass 
of F&amp;Vs, it is also possible that the variety 
of F&amp;Vs consumed and, indeed, the rel-
ative proportion of fruit versus vegetables 
consumed may be important in terms of 
influencing diabetes risk. Findings from a 
recent nested case-control study of the 
EPIC-Norfolk cohort have indicated that 
both total quantity of F&amp;Vs and F&amp;V va-
riety (at least 12 different F&amp;V items per 
week) are inversely and independently as-
sociated with risk of type 2 diabetes (11). 
It is possible that, although participants in 
this study were encouraged to eat a variety 
of F&amp;Vs, in line with government advice, 
they did not achieve sufficient variety in 
their intake to influence metabolism. 
With regard to the idea that vegetables 
may have a greater effect on IR and diabe-
tes risk, an examination of the contribu-
tion of fruit to total F&amp;V intake in this 
study found that the percentage contribu-
tion made by fruit increased significantly 
across groups during the intervention 
(fruit intake comprised ;43% of total 
F&amp;V intake for the group receiving two 
portions per day, rising to 64 and 69%, 
respectively, for the groups receiving four 
and seven portions per day). However, it 
was not possible to examine the response 
to intervention according to those who 
ate more fruit compared with those who </p>

<p>ate more vegetables because the behavior 
within groups was quite consistent; all in-
dividuals in the group receiving seven 
portions per day consumed more fruit 
than vegetables. With regard to the in-
crease in fruit intake, it is important to 
note that, in line with current public 
health advice, participants were informed 
that fruit or vegetable juice could only 
count as one of their F&amp;V portions daily, 
and so they were advised to limit their 
juice consumption accordingly and to in-
crease their intake of F&amp;Vs by consuming 
the intact food rather than relying on fruit 
or vegetable juice to boost their intake. 
Adherence to this advice was evident in 
the participant food diaries, and there 
were no high juice consumers in the 
study. As discussed above, because this 
study did not restrict the types or propor-
tions of F&amp;Vs consumed, there were sig-
nificant differences among groups in 
change in sugar intake, and other factors 
such as glycemic index and glycemic load 
are also likely to have changed, although 
this has not been formally examined. 
Again, a more prescriptive intervention 
controlling for such variables may 
provide a different answer to the one 
found here. Because this study did not 
control for the type of F&amp;V or the relative 
proportion of fruit versus vegetables to be 
consumed by participants, it cannot an-
swer questions regarding the appropriate-
ness of more specific guidance on F&amp;V 
intake; rather, this study examined the 
implementation of the general message 
promoted in the U.K. and the U.S. to 
eat a variety of F&amp;Vs each day, generally 
aiming for at least five servings a day. It is 
interesting to note that public health 
guidance in Australia advocates a two-
fruit-plus-five-vegetable approach in 
their guidance to consumers (35). It is 
likely that public health advice in other 
countries may, similarly, evolve over 
time to become more specific. However, 
there are a limited number of studies to 
date regarding the importance of F&amp;V va-
riety for health outcomes or examining 
the specific health effects of fruit versus 
vegetables (36). 
Apart from the current study, to our 
knowledge, no other study to date has 
specifically examined the effect of whole 
F&amp;Vs on IR using the gold standard 
clamp methodology. A recent double-
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study in 32 obese, insulin-resistant men 
and women found that intake of 22.5 g 
of blueberry bioactives twice daily for 
6 weeks enhanced insulin sensitivity, </p>

<p>which was assessed using high-dose 
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, 
compared with placebo, perhaps suggest-
ing that the form in which F&amp;Vs are con-
sumed may be important in terms of 
antidiabetic effects (37). The latter study, 
however, does not help to inform public 
health messages about F&amp;V consumption 
inasmuch as a freeze-dried blueberry 
powder was used rather than the whole 
food or juice. Allowing volunteers to 
make their own dietary choices, as was 
applied in this protocol, is closer to the 
current real-life scenario where people re-
ceive general advice to "eat more F&amp;Vs." 
A threshold effect beyond the maximum 
portion allocation used here (seven por-
tions per day) is unlikely based on the 
existing literature (11) but cannot be ex-
cluded. However, even if such a threshold 
exists, an intake higher than seven por-
tions per day would be unattainable for 
the vast majority of the population. 
The strengths of the current study 
include its RCT design; the use of the 
clamp to assess the primary end point; 
high participant retention; the weight 
stability of participants, which prevented 
confounding of the data by weight loss; 
and the measurement of biomarkers of 
F&amp;V intake. In this study, the self-reported 
F&amp;V intakes, derived from food diaries, 
were consistent with group targets for 
participants in the groups receiving one 
to two, four, and seven portions per day 
attaining self-reported F&amp;V intakes of 
1.8, 3.8, and 7.0 portions per day, respec-
tively. This change in self-reported F&amp;V 
intake was mirrored by a statistically sig-
nificant dose-response increase in lutein 
status with increasing F&amp;V intake 
and a trend for increasing vitamin C and 
b-carotene status, thus confirming that 
the volunteers did increase their F&amp;V in-
take in a stepwise manner across groups. 
As indicated in our recent systematic review 
on this topic (38), a panel of biomarkers 
(notably a-and b-carotene, vitamin C, 
lutein, zeaxanthin, and b-cryptoxanthin) 
should be measured as indicators of com-
pliance in F&amp;V intervention trials. The 
specific biomarker changes encountered 
will vary among studies that use a mixed 
F&amp;V intervention, owing to differences 
in F&amp;V selection when free choice is 
permitted. 
In conclusion, increased F&amp;V intake 
improved micronutrient status but had 
no significant effect on IR, assessed using 
the gold standard clamp technique, in 
people at high risk of CVD when body 
weight was maintained. It appears, </p>

<p>therefore, that the beneficial effects of 
F&amp;Vs on cardiovascular health are not 
likely to be directly mediated by IR. Re-
cent evidence indicates that particular 
classes or types of F&amp;Vs may have partic-
ular antidiabetic properties; hence, it is 
possible that benefits may only be ob-
served in response to a more specific 
F&amp;V intervention. This study supports 
the continued promotion of F&amp;Vs on 
the basis of improving nutritional status 
and the overall profile of the diet but not 
in relation to direct improvement of IR 
in people at high risk of CVD. </p>
