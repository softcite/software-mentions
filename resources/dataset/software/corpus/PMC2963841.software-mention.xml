<p>ABSTRACT </p>

<p>Stress and coping in the families caring for their member with mental retardation has recently 
received worldwide research attention. There is no comprehensive instrument to study these issues 
in India. This study reports on development and standardization of a new instrument to fill this lacuna. 
Family Interview for Stress and Coping in Mental Retardation (FISC -MR), a semi-structured interview 
schedule, was developed as a part of two years prospective study of efficacy of brief family intervention 
for 157 children with mental retardation (funded by ICMR). The tool consists of 2 sections -one 
measuring stress (daily care, emotional, social and financial) and the other measuring mediators of 
stress or coping strategies (awareness, attitudes, expectations, rearing practices and social support). 
Results indicate moderate to high reliability (internal consistency, inter-rater reliability and test-retest 
reliability) and validity (factorial, criterion and construct) of the instrument. It is concluded that FISC -
MR is a useful, reliable and valid instrument for both clinical and research purposes. </p>

<p>consequences (such as social isolation). 
What are the variables which influence 
or determine the extent of stress experienced 
by the families? Studies indicate 3 sets of 
variables. These are (i) child specific variables 
such as age, sex and severity of retardation, (ii) 
socio-demographic variables such as social 
class, family income and domicile and (iii) family 
coping resources and strategies. It is interesting 
to note that studies have consistently shown that 
coping by the families has a more decisive effect 
on the stress experienced by them than the other 
2 sets of variables (Byrne &amp; Cunningham, 1985; 
Beresford,1994). Though it is clear that coping 
plays a key role in family adaptation, it has been 
a difficult research question to study. Several 
theoretical models have been utilised for 
examining this intricate process of family stress, 
coping and adaptation, such as the stress and 
coping theory of Folkman &amp; Lazarus (1984), the 
ABCX model of McCubbin (Orr et al.,1991) and 
eco-cultural model (Gallimore et al.,1993). 
What are the coping strategies employed 
by the families to deal with the stress? 
Researchers have been able to identify many 
such coping strategies. For instance, in their 
review, Gallagher and colleagues (1983) 
identified the following as important mediator 
variables (or coping strategies) which influence 
the stress felt by the families: expectations, 
attributions, parents' view of the causation of the 
handicap, nature and quality of daily interactions 
with the child, parents' notions about their own 
efficacy as 'change agents' in facilitating child's 
development, attitudes and social support. Other 
such mediating factors which have been 
identified include family beliefs and perceptions, 
religious and moral beliefs, overall philosophies 
and ideologies held by the families, family 
lifestyles and extent of harmony in the family 
(Byrne &amp; Cunningham,1985; Beresford,1994). 
The role of these issues in the family focussed 
intervention in mental retardation is evidently of 
crucial importance and has been reviewed 
elsewhere (Cunningham, 1985; Davis &amp; Rushton, 
1991; Girimaji,1993; Beresford,1994). 
A variety of approaches have beon </p>

<p>adapted by the researchers to study stress and 
coping in the families and include questionnaires 
(Fiedrich et al.,1983; Knussen &amp; Cunningham, 
1988; Dyson et al.,1993), interviews (Frey et 
al.,1989; Narayan et al.,1993), rating scales 
(Bhatti et al., 1985; Peterson,1984) and 
ethnographic methods (Gallimore et al.,1993). 
The focus of these methods has varied and 
included areas such as mothers' well-being, 
marital adjustment among parents, stress of 
parenting, parental attitudes, care-taking 
demands, perceptions and expectations. 
However, there is no one standardized 
instrument to study the variety of stresses 
experienced by the families and coping 
strategies available to them. Such an instrument 
is required not only for research purposes but 
also to facilitate family focussed intervention. 
Keeping this lacuna in mind, the authors 
developed a new instrument to evaluate stress 
and its mediators in the families of children with 
mental retardation. This work was carried out as 
a part of the initial preparation for two years 
prospective study funded by Indian Council of 
Medical Research, titled "a study of the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of brief inpatient 
family intervention versus outpatient intervention 
for mentally retarded children'. For this study, 
stress was defined as those aspects of the 
family's response to its member with mental 
retardation that are experienced as distressful. 
Mediators of stress, or coping strategies were 
defined as those aspects of family's beliefs, 
attributions, expectations, resources and 
practices that are likely to influence the stress 
experienced by the family. These definitions 
were adapted along the lines suggested by 
Galfagheret al.(1983). 
This paper describes the development 
and standardization of this instrument, which has 
been named Family Interview for Stress and 
Coping in Mental Retardation (FISC -MR). </p>

<p>MATERIAL AND METHOD </p>

<p>Description of the main study: In the project 
funded by Indian Council of Medical Research </p>



<p>INSTRUMENT FOR ASSESSING FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WITH MENTAL RETARDATION </p>

<p>and carried out at the child and adolescent 
psychiatry unit of the Department of Psychiatry 
of NIMHANS, two comprehensive models of brief, 
intensive, family-focused intervention in mental 
retardation were developed, crystallized and 
prospectively evaluated. One was the outpatient 
group and the other was the inpatient group. The 
components of intervention included (i) family 
orientation, (ii) medical measures, (iii) general 
parenting measures, and (iv) parent training. In 
all, 75 and 82 subjects were recruited for inpatient 
and outpatient group respectively. 
Many instruments were used to collect 
data at intake and follow-up. These included 
Detailed Evaluation Schedule (DES), vlneland 
Social Maturity Scale (VSMS -Matin's Indian 
Adaptation), Gessel's Developmental Schedule 
(GDS), Problem Behaviour Rating Scale 
(PBRS), Questionnaire on Resources and Stress 
(QRS-SF; Friedrich et al.,1983), FISC-MR, 
Intervention Sheet (IS) and Follow-up Sheet. The 
efficacy of intervention was studied in terms of 
(a) impact on child variables (adaptive 
functioning and problem behaviours) and (b) 
impact on families (observer rated and self report 
of family stress and coping strategies). 
The subjects and their families were 
prospectively followed up every three months 
for a period of two years. Instruments measuring 
outcome were repeatedly administered at the 
time of follow-up visits. 
Development and description of the FISC-
MR: An in-depth survey of the all the available 
instruments were made. Authors also drew heavily 
from their clinical experience in the field. Following 
this, sections, areas and sub-scales were decided 
upon and questions were prepared to cover the 
sub-scales. This instrument has been developed 
not only for recording the perceived stress and 
its mediators (or coping strategies) in the family, 
but also to help in the formulation of family based 
intervention. 
The final prepared version of the 
instrument is an observer rated, semi-structured 
interview schedule and attempts to 
systematically elicit and quantify (i) the stress 
experienced (perceived) by families caring for a </p>

<p>child with mental retardation and (ii) certain key 
coping strategies specific to disability employed 
by the families that are likely to modify the 
perceived stress (mediators). Accordingly, 
FISC-MR has 2 major Sections : Section-I is 
meant for elicitation of perceived stress in 
different area and Section-ll for exploration of 
certain mediating factors or coping strategies. 
The structure of these two Section is laid out in 
table 1. In short, Section-I has 4 areas and a 
total of 11 sub-scales, whereas Section-ll has 5 
areas and a total of 9 sub-scales. A four or five 
point rating scale with scoring instructions are 
provided for each sub-scale. The sub-scales on 
stress are rated on a 5 point scale (no or minimal 
stress to very high level) and those in the 
Section-ll are rated on a 4 point scale (most 
favourable to most unfavourable). Table 2 and 
3 give details of the scoring patterns for Section 
I and II respectively. The approximate time 
required for the administration of the instrument 
was around 45 minutes. </p>

<p>research staff of the project were trained in the 
nature, theoretical background and method of 
administration of the instrument. Training also 
consisted of practical demonstration, pilot 
administration and feedback. They were asked 
to rate the families for the study purpose 
following a satisfactory period of training. The 
families recruited for the study initially underwent 
a detailed evaluation by the research staff, who 
familiarized themselves with the nature of child's 
problems and the background of the families. 
Following a discussion with one of the authors, 
they went on to administer FISC-MR to the key 
family members (both parents in 93% of 
instances). They were blind to previous rating 
while administering the instrument during 
follow-ups. </p>

<p>Sample for standardization : As noted, the 
sample consisted of families of 157 subjects with </p>

<p>mental retardation attending the mental 
retardation clinic of NIMHANS who fulfilled the 
criteria for inclusion into the main study. Subjects 
were of a young age (around 50% under 3 years 
of age), from a lower socioeconomic 
background, both rural and urban and with </p>

<p>RESULT </p>

<p>The results of standardization of the 
instrument are reported below in terms of 
reliability and validity. The analyses were done 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 6.0</rs>. 
Reliability Measures : Three measures of 
reliability were calculated, as follows: Cronbach's 
Alpha, a measure of internal consistency, 
calculated for the whole sample (N=155, data 
for 2 cases missing) separately for Section-I and 
Section-ll, was 0.9 and 0.67 respectively. Inter-
rater reliability of 3 raters for 9 families was 
computed. The intra-class correlation co-efficient 
(ICC) for any single rater was 0.81 and average 
reliability for all 3 raters was 0.93, indicating good 
inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was 
calculated for a sub-sample of families who were 
evaluated at intake and again after a mean 
duration of 4.5 months (N=110). Pearson's Yfor 
Section-I was 0.71 (p&lt;.01) and for Section-ll was 
0.36 (p&lt;.01), indicating moderate to high test-
retest reliability. </p>

<p>Measures of Validity: A factorial validation was 
attempted to find out whether the scale yields a 
small number of meaningful factors. A principal 
components analysis with varimax rotation 
followed by factor extraction with eigen values 
more than 1 was carried out separately for 
Section-I and Section-ll. All the sub-scales (11 
for Section-I and 9 for Section-ll) were included 
for factor analysis. Section-I yielded two factors. 
On inspection of the loading, factor 1 has been 
labelled as socio-emotional stress and factor 2 
as stress of daily care demand. Similarly, 
Se'ction-ll yielded 3 factors and have been 
named as awareness/expectations, attitudes/ 
rearing practices and social support respectively. 
The loading of sub-scales on these factors have 
been given in table 5. 
Criterion Validity : Since FISC MR is a newly 
developed instrument, it was decided to 
concurrently evaluate all the families with another 
well established instrument. For this purpose, 
Questionnaire on Resources and Stress -Short 
Form (QRS-SF) developed by Friedrich and his 
colleagues (Friedrich et al.,1983) and widely used </p>

<p>in USA was chosen. This is a self-report 
Questionnaire of family stress completed by a 
key family member and has 52 items. The 
criterion or concurrent validity, as measured as 
Pearson's Y between Section-I and QRS-SF 
score for 157 families at intake was 0.63 (p&lt;.01), 
indicating moderate criterion or concurrent 
validity. 
Construct Validity : It was hypothesized that 
measure of stress (total score on Section-I) 
should correlate with measure of mediators (total 
score on Section-ll), which was indeed so, 
Pearson's Y between-Section-I total score and 
Section-ll total score was found to be 0.51, 
(p&lt;.001), indicating a moderate degree of </p>

<p>evidence for construct validity. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>From the results, it is evident that the new 
instrument reasonably satisfies the requirements 
of standardisation in terms of reliability and 
validity. The coefficients of measures of reliability 
were between 0.36 to 0.9. Some loss of 
association may have occurred in test-retest 
reliability due to the possibility of intervention 
acting as a confounding variable. The 
coefficients of validity measures were between 
0.51 and 0.63, indicating a reasonable degree 
of validity. In the factorial study, though there 
was some overlap of items between the factors, 
the overall factor loading of items revealed 
meaningful factors. The emergence of two 
factors in the Section-I viz., emotional/social and 
stress of care demand, is in keeping with the 
findings reported by others (Crnic et al.,1983; 
Friedrich et al.,1983). Section 2 yielded 3 factors 
as already mentioned, with sub-scales of 
awareness and expectations hanging together 
in the first factor, those of attitudes and rearing 
practices coming together in the second and 
social support and global adaptation in the third. 
These findings shed some light on the process 
of coping and adaptation in these families. It is 
also worthwhile to note that total score on 
Section-ll (signifying the extent of coping in the 
families), correlated significantly with total score 
on Section-I (signifying the extent of stress in 
the families), indicating the importance of coping 
as a determinant of perceived stress in the 
families. Further refinement of the instrument 
based on the results of the factor analysis was 
not attempted in this study. However, it is worth 
noting that all the sub-scales loaded significantly 
on one or other factor, indicating that none of 
the sub-scales were redundant. 
During the use of this instrument in the 
project work, we found it to be of definite value 
in terms of getting a better understanding of the 
families, to develop good rapport with them to 
facilitate further work and in planning targeted </p>

<p>intervention, be it in the form of improving their 
coping skills, relieving their personal distress, 
enhancing their rearing and training practices, 
or improving their social life. So, the instrument, 
to our mind, can not only serve for research 
purposes but also for planning management. The 
instrument has already been used, either in the 
original or modified form in 3 postgraduate 
dissertations and experience thereof lends 
additional support to usefulness of the instrument 
(Gaekwad,1993; Anand,1996; Rathnasabapathy, 
1996). The training requirements for using this 
instrument would include (i) experience of having 
worked with several families of children with 
mental retardation, (ii) a reasonable 
understanding of the structure and rationale of 
the instrument, and (iii) few pilot administrations 
under an experienced supervisor. 
One limitation of this instrument is that it 
has been developed primarily for families of 
children with severe forms of mental retardation 
and therefore best suited for use in this group. 
However, the utility with families of older subjects 
with milder forms of mental retardation is yet to 
be tested and perhaps some modifications might 
be needed for this purpose, as the worries and 
concerns of parents and care-givers in this 
population could be different, for instance issues 
concerning family life cycle, sexuality, marriage, 
guardianship and vocational habitation. Another 
limitation of the instrument is that it takes 
approximately 45 minutes to administer, further 
refinements may be warranted to prepare a 
shorter version for wider clinical use. 
The recent socio-cultural changes in India 
appear to have had an adverse influence of 
increasing the stress faced by the families in 
caring for individuals with mental retardation, and 
hence calls for greater professional involvement 
and support. The availability of this instrument 
hopefully will be a small step in furthering the 
services and research in this area. </p>
