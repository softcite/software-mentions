<p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections in the seriously 
ill, and the primary agent of chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. A major 
obstacle to effective control of P. aeruginosa infections is its intrinsic resistance to most 
antibiotic classes, which results from chromosomally encoded drug-efflux systems and 
multiple acquired resistance mechanisms selected by years of aggressive antibiotic therapy. 
These factors demand new strategies and drugs to prevent and treat P. aeruginosa 
infections. Herein, we describe a monoclonal antibody (mAb) selection strategy on whole 
P. aeruginosa cells using single-chain variable fragment phage libraries derived from healthy 
individuals and patients convalescing from P. aeruginosa infections. This approach enabled 
identification of mAbs that bind three distinct epitopes on the product of the Psl. This 
exopolysaccharide is important for P. aeruginosa attachment to mammalian cells, and for 
the formation and maintenance of biofilms produced by nonmucoid and mucoid P. aeruginosa 
isolates. Functional screens revealed that mAbs to one epitope exhibit superior activity in 
opsonophagocytic killing and cell attachment assays, and confer significant protection in 
multiple animal models. Our results indicate that Psl is an accessible serotype-independent 
surface feature and promising novel protective antigen for preventing P. aeruginosa 
infections. Furthermore, our mAb discovery strategy holds promise for application to other 
bacterial pathogens. </p>



<p>Protective P. aeruginosa Psl binding antibodies | DiGiandomenico et al. </p>

<p>opsonophagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa in vitro, inhibited bac-
terial attachment to cultured lung epithelial cells, and provided 
potent prophylactic protection in multiple animal models of 
P. aeruginosa infection. These data indicate that Psl is a novel 
protective antigen and that antibodies targeting Psl might be an 
effective measure for prophylaxis against P. aeruginosa infections 
in high-risk patients. Furthermore, the phenotypic whole-cell 
screening approach coupled with the early relevant mechanism 
of action screens shows significant promise for identifying new 
bacterial targets and antibodies that are active against other 
challenging bacterial pathogens. </p>

<p>RESULTS 
Construction and screening of human 
antibody phage display libraries 
Patients recently exposed and recovering from P. aeruginosa in-
fection are a possible enriched source of protective P. aeruginosa 
antibodies. With this in mind, we used a target-indifferent 
P. aeruginosa whole-cell panning approach with human scFv 
phage libraries to identify novel protective antigens. An M13 
phage-based human antibody library was constructed from 
peripheral blood B cells collected from subjects 7-10 d after 
documented P. aeruginosa infection. The final cloned scFv 
library contained 5.4 × 10 8 transformants, and sequencing 
revealed that 79% of scFv genes were full-length and in-frame. 
The V H CDR3 loops, often important for determining epitope 
specificity, were 84% diverse at the amino acid level before 
library selection (unpublished data). 
After development and validation of the whole-cell affin-
ity selection methodology, both the patient library and a pre-
viously constructed library derived from multiple healthy 
subjects (Vaughan et al., 1996) underwent affinity selection 
on suspensions of P. aeruginosa strain 3064 (possessing a com-
plete O-antigen), as well as an isogenic wapR mutant strain 
that lacked surface expression of O-antigen. Output titers 
from successive patient library selections were found to in-
crease at a greater rate for the patient library than for the 
naive library (10 7 vs. 3 × 10 5 at round 3, respectively; unpub-
lished data). Duplication of V H CDR3 loop sequences in the 
libraries, which is a measure of clonal enrichment during se-
lection, was also found to be higher in the patient library, 
reaching 88-92%, compared with 15-25% in the healthy sub-
ject library at round 3 (unpublished data). This suggests that 
donors contributing to the patient library were responding to 
infection by expanding B cell repertoires specific for P. aerugi-
nosa. Individual scFv phage from affinity selections were next 
screened by ELISA for reactivity to P. aeruginosa heterologous 
serotype strains. As expected, the dominant phage type obtained 
from whole-cell selections with both libraries were clones that 
did not cross react with multiple O-antigen serotypes. However 
clones exhibiting serotype-independent binding to P. aeruginosa 
in the absence of nonspecific binding to E. coli or bovine serum 
albumin were identified and selected for further evaluation. 
Human IgG1 antibodies made with the variable regions en-
coded by the selected phage were further evaluated for speci-
ficity and prioritized for subsequent analysis by whole-cell </p>

<p>of returning to specific antibody-based prophylaxis or therapy 
(Saylor et al., 2009). In particular, these drugs could be effec-
tive in preventing or treating high-risk hospital infections 
caused by bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
P. aeruginosa is a highly adaptable opportunistic bacterium 
that can cause life-threatening infections. Already intrinsically 
resistant to many antibiotics, reports of P. aeruginosa acquisition 
of multidrug resistance to late generation antibiotics are now 
common (Jovcic et al., 2011; Kunz and Brook, 2010). This real-
ity demands new approaches and drugs to prevent and treat 
P. aeruginosa infections. Efforts to select protective antibodies 
to P. aeruginosa and other pathogens have been mostly target-
centric, focusing on bacterial surface features or virulence fac-
tors correlated with disease. Antibodies targeting P. aeruginosa 
O-antigen, flagella, alginate, and components of the type 3 secre-
tion system have all shown potential, and some are currently 
being tested in clinical studies (Döring et al., 1995, 2007; Sawa 
et al., 1999; Pier et al., 2004; Neely et al., 2005; DiGiandomenico 
et al., 2007). However, the development of antibody phage 
libraries and high-throughput capabilities to identify active 
leads has made it possible to take a more target-indifferent 
approach in which desirable mAb activities are first identified, 
followed by elucidation. In principal, this strategy is similar to 
the approach used to identify the targets for all antibiotics cur-
rently approved for human use, in which leads with desirable 
activities were selected before their targets were identified. 
Here, we describe a phenotypic or target indifferent strategy 
based on selecting human single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-
expressing phage on whole P. aeruginosa bacteria. After first 
enriching for P. aeruginosa whole-cell binding, phage derived 
from highly diverse antibody libraries constructed from mul-
tiple healthy subjects or convalescing P. aeruginosa-infected 
patients were converted to IgG1 mAbs and screened for desir-
able and potentially protective activities. Using this strategy, we 
identified mAbs that bind three distinct epitopes of P. aeruginosa 
Psl, an exopolysaccharide involved in host cell attachment and 
in the formation and maintenance of biofilms produced by 
both nonmucoid and mucoid strains (Friedman and Kolter, 
2004; Jackson et al., 2004; Matsukawa and Greenberg, 2004; 
Byrd et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2009). The structure of Psl, which 
consists of a repeating pentasaccharide containing d-mannose, 
d-glucose, and l-rhamnose, was recently described (Byrd 
et al., 2009). Interestingly, visualization of Psl on the surface of 
P. aeruginosa indicates that it is anchored to the cell surface in 
a helical pattern; an organization that is thought to provide a 
scaffold for other biofilm-initiating components, as well as 
contributing to cell-cell interactions (Ma et al., 2009). Although 
synthesis and transport of Psl to the surface of P. aeruginosa has 
not been characterized, several proteins encoded by the Psl 
biosynthetic gene loci are homologous to proteins found in 
the Wzy-dependent biosynthesis pathway of Escherichia coli 
group 1 capsular polysaccharides (Franklin et al., 2011). 
Our results indicate that Psl is a serotype-independent, 
antibody-accessible antigen that is prevalent among both 
nonmucoid and mucoid clinical isolates. Interestingly, mAbs 
that bound to one particular Psl epitope mediated potent </p>

<p>Serotype-independent anti-P. aeruginosa 
antibodies target the Psl exopolysaccharide 
We first analyzed whether serotype-independent antibodies tar-
geted protein or carbohydrate antigens on P. aeruginosa. No loss 
of binding was observed in ELISA of PAO1 whole-cell extracts 
that were exhaustively digested with proteinase K, suggesting 
that antibody reactivity targeted surface accessible carbohydrate 
residues (unpublished data). We initially hypothesized the anti-
bodies targeted the LPS core region or alginate because these 
structures have conserved motifs among P. aeruginosa strains. 
Isogenic strains of PAO1 were constructed with mutations in 
genes responsible for O-antigen, alginate, and LPS core biosyn-
thesis; PAO1wbpL (O-antigen deficient); PAO1wbpL/algD 
(O-antigen and alginate deficient); PAO1rmlC (O-antigen 
deficient and truncated outer core); and PAO1galU (O-antigen 
deficient and truncated inner core). Cam-003 binding to 
PAO1wbpL or the PAO1wbpL/algD double mutant was 
comparable to wild-type PAO1; however, binding to the 
PAO1rmlC and PAO1galU single mutants was negligible </p>

<p>binding to clinically relevant P. aeruginosa serotypes (O11, O6, 
O9, O1) by FACS analysis. FACS-positive mAbs confirmed 
to bind to P. aeruginosa independent of serotype (unpublished 
data) were prioritized for functional activity screening in op-
sonophagocytic killing (OPK) assays. </p>

<p>Identification of mAbs promoting OPK of P. aeruginosa 
Antibodies that mediate phagocyte-dependent killing of 
P. aeruginosa have been correlated with in vivo efficacy (Pollack 
and Young, 1979; Pier and Markham, 1986). Human IgG1 anti-
bodies selected as described in the previous paragraph, were 
evaluated for their potential to promote OPK of P. aeruginosa. 
With the exception of WapR-007 and the negative control anti-
body R347, all antibodies mediated concentration and com-
plement-dependent killing of PAO1.lux (Fig. 1 A). Cam-003 
exhibited superior OPK activity, having an EC 50 10-fold 
lower than the next best mAb, WapR-016 (Fig. 1 A; Table 1). 
We also evaluated the ability of Cam-003 to mediate OPK 
activity against representative nonmucoid strains from clinically 
relevant O-antigen serotypes and against mucoid P. aeruginosa 
strains that were derived from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. 
Cam-003 mediated potent OPK of all nonmucoid clinical 
isolates tested, consistent with its ability to bind heterologous </p>

<p>Epitope mapping was performed by competition ELISA and confirmed using an Octet flow system with Psl derived from the supernatant of an overnight culture of PAO1. 
The results indicate that Psl antibodies bind to at least three epitopes, which we refer to as class I, II, and III. Class I and II antibodies do not compete for binding; however, the 
class III antibody, WapR-016, partially inhibits binding of the class I and II antibodies. Antibody affinity was determined by Octet binding assays using Psl derived from the 
supernatant of overnight PAO1 cultures. Antibody K D was determined by averaging the binding kinetics of seven concentrations for each antibody. Also shown is a summary 
of cell attachment and OPK data experiments for each antibody. ELISA and antibody affinity was determined using three independent studies. </p>

<p>serotype-independent anti-P. aeruginosa mAbs selected during 
phenotypic screening were shown by ELISA to not bind 
PAO1pslA, in contrast to wild-type PAO1, indicating that the 
remaining mAbs also targeted Psl (unpublished data). To confirm 
these results, we performed a Psl capture binding assay with pro-
teinase K-treated enriched carbohydrate purified from PAO1 
wbpL/algD/pelA (O-antigen, alginate, and Pel exopolysac-
charide deficient) using a ForteBio Octet instrument. In this 
assay, individual antibodies were bound to aminopropylsilane 
biosensors, followed by blocking and the addition of enriched 
carbohydrate (capture of antigen). After washing to remove 
unbound antigen, binding of unlabeled mAbs was assessed. 
All antibodies (Cam-003, Cam-004, Cam-005, WapR-001, 
WapR-002, WapR-003, WapR-007, and WapR-016), with 
the exception of the control mAb R347, were capable of cap-
turing antigen that strongly reacted with Cam-003, WapR-001, 
WapR-002, WapR-003, and WapR-016 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, 
minimal reactivity to captured Psl was observed with Cam-
004, Cam-005, and WapR-007, even though all three of these 
antibodies captured sufficient Psl to potently react with </p>

<p>Psl biosynthesis (Byrd et al., 2009). Cam-003 failed to bind 
PAO1pslA when tested by ELISA and FACS (Fig. 2, B and C), 
and also failed to mediate OPK of this mutant (Fig. 2 F). In 
addition, Western blot analysis of LPS extracted from PAO1 and 
PAO1pslA using antisera from PAO1-vaccinated mice re-
vealed the LPS binding pattern of this mutant to be comparable 
to wild-type PAO1 (Fig. 2 D), confirming that the LPS of 
PAO1pslA was intact and not the target of Cam-003. Bind-
ing of Cam-003 was restored in a PAO1wbpL/algD/pslA 
(O-antigen-, alginate-, and Psl-deficient) triple mutant com-
plemented with pslA expressed from a P. aeruginosa expression 
plasmid (Fig. 2 E), as was the ability of Cam-003 to mediate op-
sonic killing of complemented PAO1pslA (Fig. 2 G). We also 
evaluated Cam-003 binding to PAO1pelA, which is deficient 
in expression of the Pel exopolysaccharide, a glucose-rich poly-
saccharide polymer that is also known to play a role in P. aerugi-
nosa biofilm formation (Friedman and Kolter, 2004; Colvin 
et al., 2011). Cam-003 binding to PAO1pelA was similar to 
PAO1wbpL/algD and the PAO1wbpL/algD/pslA triple 
mutant complemented with pslA (Fig. 2 E). The remaining </p>

O-antigen, alginate, and Pel polysaccharide production. In addition, the enriched carbohydrate extract was exhaustively digested with proteinase K. Antibodies 
were bound to aminopropylsilane sensors, followed by the addition of enriched carbohydrate. After washing, binding of the other indicated mAbs to 
mAb-captured carbohydrate (Psl exopolysaccharide) was assessed. (A-I) Data are representative results from three independent experiments. </p>



<p>Protective P. aeruginosa Psl binding antibodies | DiGiandomenico et al. </p>

<p>Psl expression among clinical isolates in vitro and in vivo 
A survey of Cam-003 binding by ELISA to 173 P. aeruginosa 
clinical isolates from diverse infection types and geographical lo-
cations revealed Psl expression/accessibility in 85% of all strains 
tested (unpublished data). Subgroup analysis revealed that Psl/ 
Cam-003 reactivity is more frequently observed with isolates 
from confirmed nonchronic infections (96%) relative to strains 
obtained from the lungs of CF patients (73%). Psl was detected 
on 91.7% of confirmed ventilator-associated pneumonia iso-
lates and 96.1% of isolates derived from diverse tissues (i.e., 
urinary tract, eye, sinus, skin and soft tissue, and intestinal tract 
infections). Among confirmed CF isolates, 73% were Psl posi-
tive (40 of 55 strains), including 10 of 11 mucoid strains (91%). 
We next determined if the relative Psl expression levels 
were maintained on the surface of P. aeruginosa after in vivo 
passage in mice. For these experiments, mice were initially in-
fected by intraperitoneal injection with wild-type P. aeruginosa 
strains PAO1, 6206, and 6077 or with a pslA deletion mutant 
of PAO1 (PAO1pslA) prepared from confluent overnight 
cultures on plates. PAO1, 6206, and 6077 prepared in this 
manner all displayed reduced or no Cam-003 staining in com-
parison to bacteria grown to log phase 
in liquid culture, suggesting that Psl 
was either expressed at lower levels or 
was less accessible to the antibody on 
the bacterial preparations used to infect 
mice (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, 
PAO1pslA exhibited no Cam-003 
staining under in vitro growth condi-
tions (Fig. 4 A and B). At 4 or 24 h after </p>

independently of serotype target epitopes associated with 
Psl exopolysaccharide. </p>

<p>Anti-Psl mAbs block attachment of P. aeruginosa 
to cultured epithelial cells 
Psl is important in facilitating P. aeruginosa colonization of host 
tissues and establishing/maintaining biofilms (Borlee et al., 
2010). Given these characteristics, we tested whether anti-Psl 
antibodies prevented P. aeruginosa association with epithelial 
cells. With the exception of Cam-005 and WapR-007, all anti-
bodies reduced association of PAO1.lux with A549 human 
pulmonary epithelial cells (Fig. 1 D). As in the OPK assays, 
Cam-003 was also the most active at inhibiting cell attachment, 
providing an 80% reduction compared with the negative 
control (Fig. 1 D and Table 1). WapR-016 was the second most 
active antibody, exhibiting similar inhibitory activity as Cam-003 
but at 10-fold higher antibody concentration. </p>

<p>Figure 4. Anti-Psl binding to P. aeruginosa 
passaged in vivo. To test if Psl expression is 
maintained in vivo, BALB/c mice were injected 
intraperitoneally with P. aeruginosa isolates, 
followed by harvesting of bacteria by peritoneal 
lavage 4 h after infection. The presence of Psl 
was analyzed with a control antibody and 
Cam-003 by FACS. (A) For the positive control, 
Cam-003 was assayed for binding to strains 
grown in vitro to log-phase from an overnight

lenge, bacteria was harvested from mice by

binding. (D) 4 h after intranasal challenge, 
bacteria was harvested from mice by BAL and

intranasal challenge, bacteria was harvested 
from mice by BAL and assayed for Cam-003 
binding. Three animals were used in each 
group for the peritoneal lavage, and eight 
mice were used for BAL at each time point.

<p>this time point (Fig. 4 D). However, for both strain PAO1 
and 6206, strong Cam-003 staining was observed at 24 h after 
infection (Fig. 4 E). Collectively, these data suggest that Psl 
expression or accessibility increases after exposure of the bac-
teria to the in vivo environment. </p>

<p>In vivo protection afforded by anti-Psl mAb Cam-003 
Given the superior activity of Cam-003 in the OPK and cell 
attachment assays (Fig. 1, A-D), we focused on evaluation of 
this mAb in vivo. Cam-003 was evaluated in a mouse acute 
lethal pneumonia model against P. aeruginosa strains repre-
senting the most dominant serotypes associated with clinical 
disease. In these experiments, mice received a single intra-
peritoneal injection of mAb 24 h before intranasal infection 
with different strains of P. aeruginosa including the pslA 
knockout strain, PAO1pslA. Cam-003 provided potent 
protection to strain PAO1 at both 15 and 5mg/kg while pro-
viding significant concentration-dependant survival in mice 
infected with strain 6294 compared with control mAb-treated 
animals (Fig. 5, A and C). No protection was observed to the 
Psl mutant strain, PAO1pslA, which was used as a negative </p>

<p>infection, bacteria were recovered from the mice by peritoneal 
lavage and analyzed for Cam-003 staining by FACS. All of the 
wild-type P. aeruginosa strains collected 4 h after infection 
showed strong Cam-003 staining, which was comparable to 
log phase cultured bacteria (Fig. 4, A and C). In contrast, no 
Cam-003 binding was observed with PAO1pslA collected 
from the peritoneal cavities of infected mice (Fig. 4 C). At 
24 h after infection, an insufficient number of intact viable 
bacteria were harvested from the mice to allow FACS analysis 
of Psl expression/accessibility. However, Cam-003 reactivity 
was observed by ELISA for peritoneal lavage samples of PAO1, 
6206, and 6077 at 24 h after infection, indicating that Psl was 
still present in these samples (unpublished data). 
We next assessed the level of Psl expression/accessibility 
on the surface of P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and 6206 in the 
acute pneumonia model. Bacteria were prepared from over-
night-incubated, confluent plates as described in the previous 
paragraph, intranasally administered to mice, and then recov-
ered from the lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at 4 and 
24 h after infection. Strong Cam-003 staining was observed 
for PAO1 at 4 h after infection, but was minimal for 6206 at </p>

PAO1pslA (3e7 CFU; A), 33356 (3e7 CFU; B), 6294 (7e6 CFU; C), or 6077 (1e6 CFU; D). Animals were monitored for survival between 72 and 120 h 
after infection. In all experiments, PBS and R347 served as negative controls. (A) A PBS control was not tested in this experiment because previous 
results indicated no difference in survival versus mice treated with R347. In its place, we used challenge with PAO1pslA as an additional control. 
Results are represented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves; differences in survival were calculated by the log-rank test for Cam-003 versus R347.

<p>the fact that a lower required challenge dose, and thus, less 
LPS, is also administered to initiate the infection, allowing 
the anti-Psl mAb's mechanisms more time to clear the patho-
gen while the bacteria is proliferating and spreading before 
endotoxic shock ensues. 
Cam-003 was next evaluated for its ability to reduce 
P. aeruginosa organ burden in the lung, and dissemination to 
distal organs with the same bacterial strains evaluated in the 
survival studies. Cam-003 significantly reduced P. aeruginosa 
lung burden for all strains tested (Fig. 6, A-D). Interestingly, 
Cam-003 was significantly effective against the highly patho-
genic cytotoxic strain, 6077 (Fig. 6 D). Cam-003 also mark-
edly reduced dissemination to the spleen and kidneys in mice 
infected with PAO1, 6294, and 6077, while dissemination to 
these organs for all treatment groups was not observed in 
ATCC 33356-infected mice (Fig. 6, A-D).

<p>control in the PAO1 acute pneumonia study (Fig. 5 A), con-
firming the lack of Cam-003 activity against strains deficient 
in Psl expression. It should be noted that in this high chal-
lenge dose acute lethal pneumonia model, endotoxic shock is 
a substantial component of the pathogenicity and an isogenic 
Psl null strain is comparable or even more lethal in compari-
son to the wild-type strain. Complete protection from chal-
lenge with strain ATCC 33356 or the cytotoxic strain 6077 
was afforded by Cam-003 at 45 and 15 mg/kg while 80 and 
90% survival was observed at 5mg/kg for ATCC 33356 and 
6077, respectively (Fig. 5, B and D). The level of protection 
afforded by Cam-003 against strain 6077 was particularly im-
pressive since this strain is 200-fold more pathogenic than 
strain PAO1, ATCC 33356, and 6294. The increased pathogenic-
ity of 6077 is due to the presence of the type 3 secretion system 
protein, ExoU, which harbors potent phospholipase activity 
when delivered to host cells (Sato et al., 2003). The enhanced 
protection observed against this strain is likely explained by </p>

<p>affinity did not correlate with in vitro potency. Although 
WapR-003 exhibited lower affinity for Psl than WapR-001, 
these mAbs were equally active in the OPK and cell attach-
ment inhibition assays (Table 1 and Fig. 1, A and D). In con-
trast, higher affinity did correlate with enhanced functional 
activity among the class I mAbs, with Cam-003 exhibiting the 
highest affinity for Psl and also demonstrating the greatest po-
tency in the OPK and cell attachment assays when compared 
with Cam-004 and Cam-005 (Table 1 and Fig. 1, A and D). </p>

<p>Cam-003 Fc mutant has diminished activity 
Given the potential for dual mechanisms of action (inhibition 
of cell attachment and OPK activity), we constructed a Cam-
003 Fc mutant, Cam-003-TM, which contains sequence 
changes that reduce its ability to interact with Fc receptors 
(Oganesyan et al., 2008), to test whether in vivo protection 
against P. aeruginosa was correlated more with blocking cell 
attachment (likely to be Fc receptor independent) or with 
OPK activity (Fc receptor dependent). Although Cam-
003-TM exhibited a fivefold reduction in OPK activity com-
pared with Cam-003 (EC 50 of 0.354 and 0.064, respectively), 
inhibition of cell attachment was comparable for Cam-003 </p>

<p>to attach and colonize damaged epithelial cells. Mice receiv-
ing systemically dosed (IP) Cam-003 showed significantly less 
pathology and reduced bacterial colony forming units (CFU) 
in total eye homogenates than was observed in the R347 
control mAb-treated animals (Fig. 7, A-D). When tested in a 
P. aeruginosa thermal injury model, Cam-003 provided signifi-
cant protection at 15 and 5 mg/kg when compared with ani-
mals treated with the control R347 mAb (Fig. 7 E). </p>

<p>Epitope mapping and relative affinity of anti-Psl antibodies 
Competition binding experiments between anti-Psl mAbs 
possessing functional activity (OPK and anti-cell attachment 
activity) demonstrated that they targeted at least three unique 
epitopes on Psl. Based on this analysis, the mAbs were cate-
gorized as class I, II, and III antibodies (Table 1). Class I and II 
antibodies were noncompetitive with each other, whereas 
the lone class III antibody, WapR-016, partially competed 
with both class I and II antibodies. We next determined the 
relative affinity of each anti-Psl antibody (Table 1). Although 
class II mAbs had the highest affinities of all the anti-Psl anti-
bodies, they exhibited substantially less functional activity 
in vitro than the class I mAb Cam-003. Among the class II mAbs, </p>

was performed as previously described (DiGiandomenico et al., 2007). Differences in pathology scores and viable CFU were determined by the Mann-

<p>Protective P. aeruginosa Psl binding antibodies | DiGiandomenico et al. </p>

<p>previously been attempted in the identification of mAbs that 
bind other microorganisms and cancer cells (Reiche et al., 
2002; Zou et al., 2007; Beerli et al., 2008; Fukuchi et al., 
2010), this is the first example using this approach with both 
healthy subject and convalescent patient donors in combina-
tion with mechanistic activity screening and target identifica-
tion for a bacterial pathogen. All antibodies shown to bind 
multiple P. aeruginosa serotypes were determined to target the 
Psl exopolysaccharide, suggesting that Psl is ubiquitous and 
readily accessible on the surface of P. aeruginosa. Although the 
greatest clonal enrichment, broadest coverage of multiple Psl 
epitopes, and highest affinity anti-Psl mAbs were isolated 
from the phage library derived from P. aeruginosa-infected 
convalescing patients, it is noteworthy that the convalescent 
patient library did not yield significantly more OPK active 
antibodies. It is tempting to speculate that expansion of 
pathogen-specific antibody subsets in infected patients are 
not necessarily directed to the most protective epitopes. 
Therefore, to identify mAbs with the greatest protective 
activity, it is important to implement functional activity assays, 
such as those described herein, as early as possible in the </p>

<p>and Cam-003-TM (Fig. 8, A and B). When tested in the 
mouse acute pneumonia model, Cam-003-TM was similar 
in potency to Cam-003 at a low infectious inoculum of 
6077 (2.4 × 10 5 CFU; Fig. 8 C). However, further titration 
of the antibody dose followed by challenge with a larger 
infectious inoculum (1.07 × 10 6 ) revealed that Cam-003 
activity was superior to Cam-003-TM, suggesting that 
OPK activity significantly contributes to optimal protection 
in vivo (Fig. 8 D). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION 
In this study, we used a phenotypic whole-cell selection ap-
proach to identify serotype-independent mAbs that mediated 
OPK activity against P. aeruginosa and inhibited attachment 
to epithelial cells. The most active antibody in both the OPK 
and cell attachments assays described in this study, Cam-003, 
was also shown to be prophylactically protective in three dis-
tinct clinically relevant P. aeruginosa murine infection models: 
pneumonia, thermal injury, and ocular keratitis, which em-
phasizes the different aspects of opportunistic P. aeruginosa in-
fections. Although whole-cell phage panning approaches have </p>

<p>2005; Ryder et al., 2007) and has more recently been shown 
to serve as an essential scaffold in biofilms produced by alginate-
secreting mucoid bacteria (Ma et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012). 
Psl is also reported to be involved in facilitating attachment 
of P. aeruginosa to epithelial cells and in forming/maintaining 
biofilms in vivo (Jackson et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2009; Borlee 
et al., 2010). In addition, very recent studies show that Psl 
inhibits efficient opsonization, resulting in reduced neutro-
phil production of reactive oxygen species and decreased 
killing by phagocytic cells, providing a distinct survival advan-
tage in vivo (Mishra et al., 2012). The preponderance of 
evidence cited above and elsewhere certainly suggests po-
tential rationale and data for survival advantages conferred to 
P. aeruginosa by Psl during infection. Furthermore, the current 
literature and our own studies support Psl as a colonization or 
persistence-by-enhancing determinant for the bacteria, and 
not a virulence-or acute lethality-enhancing feature. We 
showed that strain PAO1pslA is at least comparable or even 
marginally more lethal than wild-type PAO1 when used to 
induce acute pneumonia in mice. In this model, which 
requires a high challenge dose of bacteria, onset of endotoxic 
shock is considered a substantial component contributing to 
lethality. Our observation with the Psl mutant strain in the 
acute pneumonia model is supported by recent findings 
using a chinchilla model of otitis media, which emphasizes 
a longer term infection to study in vivo biofilm formation. 
Using this chronic infection model, Byrd et al. (2011) 
reported that P. aeruginosa proliferates from a low-challenge 
dose in which high levels of Psl expression were observed 
within in vivo biofilms, supporting the persistence observed 
with Psl-positive strains. In comparison, Psl knockouts are 
comparably or marginally more virulent in this chronic 
model while producing less bulky biofilms (Byrd et al., 
2011). Moreover, studies investigating regulation of Psl 
exopolysaccharide expression indicate that type 3 secretion 
expression for injection of known cytotoxic virulence fac-
tors are conversely regulated at least in part by RsmA, 
further suggesting a coordinated balance between persis-
tence and more virulent cytotoxic mechanisms (Irie et al., 
2010; Moscoso et al., 2011). 
Before this study, protective immune responses to Psl or 
mAbs targeting Psl have not been reported. The structure of 
Psl was only recently elucidated as a mannose-rich repeating 
pentasaccharide (Byrd et al., 2009; Kocharova et al., 1988). 
Despite its repetitive nature, our data demonstrated the pres-
ence of at least three distinct Psl epitopes. Antibody Cam-003, 
which bound the class I epitope, had the greatest anti-
P. aeruginosa activity in the OPK and cell attachment assays 
of all the anti-Psl mAbs tested. Interestingly, mAbs targeting 
the class I epitope had lower affinities for Psl than mAbs to 
other epitopes (Table 1). Given the repetitive nature of 
the Psl structure, which likely would lead to an increase in 
mAb avidity upon binding, it was surprising that mAbs harbor-
ing the greatest affinities (class II and III) did not correlate with 
increased OPK activity. Opsonophagocytosis mechanisms are 
exquisitely complex and involve a variety of opsonins and </p>

<p>screening procedure while monitoring the progressive en-
richment of specific phage by binding. Furthermore, our 
data suggests that it is most advantageous to use multiple 
independent phage libraries possessing high diversity. Cam-003 
was selected from the phage library derived from healthy 
human subjects; however, it is possible that the individuals 
from which these libraries were constructed could have been 
exposed to environmental P. aeruginosa at some point in 
their lives. 
One of the greatest technical challenges for the devel-
opment of mAbs targeting bacterial pathogens is identifi-
cation of serotype-independent antigens consistently expressed 
by the majority of clinical isolates and in the different tis-
sues or disease stages caused by the pathogen. For P. aeru-
ginosa, serotype-specific protection against acute infections 
can be achieved with O-antigen specific mAbs, although 
mAbs targeting serotype-independent protective targets, 
such as PcrV and alginate, have also been investigated (Sawa 
et al., 1999; Pier et al., 2004; Neely et al., 2005). In the case 
of PcrV, the surface-associated expression levels are not as 
robust as Psl (Ma et al., 2009; Sato et al., 2011), and anti-
bodies targeting PcrV, in contrast to anti-Psl mAbs, do not 
promote opsonophagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa, which is 
an important mechanism of clearance, particularly in a muco-
sal setting. In contrast to alginate expression, which arises 
in vivo in chronically infected patients because of muta-
tions in the negative regulator mucA (Martin et al., 1993), 
Psl expression is thought to be constitutively present on the 
surface of planktonic cells (Overhage et al., 2005; Campisano 
et al., 2006; Ghafoor et al., 2011). Importantly, the plank-
tonic phenotype of P. aeruginosa, which is characterized by 
expression of smooth-LPS, as well as other cell surface-
associated virulence factors, is believed to be important for 
initial colonization (Hancock et al., 1983; Burns et al., 2001). 
Furthermore, we show expression of Psl was maintained or up-
regulated on the surface of all wild-type strains recovered 4 h 
after intraperitoneal infection. Likewise, Psl was accessible on 
the surface of P. aeruginosa recovered from the lungs of mice 
24 h after intranasal administration. These results indicate that 
Psl expression is maintained or accessible during acute pneu-
monia at least 24 h after infection (Fig. 4). 
P. aeruginosa is a ubiquitous, extremely versatile free-
living environmental bacterium. Among its diverse lifestyles, 
enabled by its comparatively large bacterial genome, is its 
ability to colonize, persist, proliferate, and cause serious 
disease in individuals with damaged tissue or compromised 
immune defense mechanisms (Stover et al., 2000). Given the 
very high frequency of Psl expression observed in primary 
P. aeruginosa clinical isolates associated with acute clinical dis-
ease, it is likely that this unique exopolysaccharide offers 
general survival advantages to this environmental bacterium 
in the variety of conditions it encounters in its lifestyle in-
cluding the human host. In addition to prevalent expression 
in planktonic, free-living P. aeruginosa, Psl has been shown in 
to be present in the biofilm matrix secreted by nonmucoid 
sessile bacteria in vitro (Ma et al., 2009; Overhage et al., </p>



<p>Protective P. aeruginosa Psl binding antibodies | DiGiandomenico et al. </p>

<p>and is expressed in a variety of the diverse phenotypes, in-
cluding P. aeruginosa in vivo biofilms and small colony variants 
(Byrd et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012). Thus, 
targeting Psl to prevent infections in patients known to be at 
high risk of contracting acute or chronic P. aeruginosa infec-
tions likely holds more promise than actual treatment of an 
established, phenotypically diverse complex chronic infec-
tion. Ultimately, effective treatment of active persistent 
P. aeruginosa infections, particularly in the CF lung, will likely 
require multiple drug entities (small molecule antibiotic and 
biological) with distinct mechanisms of action to cover the 
strain diversity and phenotypes associated with the different 
microenvironments, stages of infection and spectrum of dis-
eases caused by the pathogen. The potential and rationale for 
an adjunctive use of an anti-Psl mAb in combination with 
antibiotics seems attractive, particularly for acute infections. 
First, adding OPK clearance to an antibiotic's direct antibac-
terial activity could reduce excessive harmful pathogen-host 
interactions that elicit hyperinflammatory host innate im-
mune responses, leading to sepsis. Second, the inhibition of 
adherence or formation of denser biofilms could aid in pre-
venting the establishment of a more persistent biofilm-based, 
antibiotic-refractory infections from a primary acute infec-
tion. However, more study is required in multiple animal 
models with multiple antibiotics and diverse strain types to 
investigate this potential anti-Psl application in adjunctive 
therapy. It is conceivable that the best approach to control-
ling P. aeruginosa infections in high risk patients may indeed 
be preventing them. Although the current study's findings 
characterizing protective anti-Psl antibodies also support Psl 
as a vaccine antigen, further definition of the class I Psl-
associated epitope could advance efforts to focus the most 
protective immune response on the right epitope. 
In summary, we have also demonstrated that through a 
combination of advanced antibody library technologies and a 
target-agnostic whole-cell panning approach, coupled with 
early engagement of informative functional screens, promis-
ing protective mAbs to conserved bacterial surface antigen 
epitopes can be identified. Moreover, this process holds 
promise for the development of antibodies targeting other 
challenging bacterial pathogens. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Construction of patient antibody phage display library. After in-
formed consent, blood samples for the isolation of B cells were obtained from 
six patients with clinical and microbiological evidence of acute infection 
(pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or bacteremia) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Blood samples were obtained 7-10 d after the onset of infection. The proto-
col and informed consent were approved by the Christiana Care Health Sys-
tem Investigational Review Board (Newark, DE). RNA extraction and 
phage library construction from whole blood was performed as previously 
described (Vaughan et al., 1996; Wrammert et al., 2008). </p>

<p>Antibody isolation using phage display technology. In addition to 
the patient library, a naive human scFv phage display library containing up 
to 10 11 binding members (Lloyd et al., 2009) was used for antibody isolation 
(Vaughan et al., 1996). Heat-killed P. aeruginosa (10 9 ) was immobilized in </p>

<p>receptors that work in concert to promote internalization of 
microorganisms (Underhill and Ozinsky, 2002). Opsono-
phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa requires complement fixation, 
particularly C3b, and engagement of both complement and 
Fc receptors. Whether other cellular receptors are involved 
or if the different classes of Psl antibodies facilitate inter-
actions with complement, Fc, or other receptors that medi-
ate activity are currently unknown. Work is under way to 
identify the Psl binding requirements for each anti-Psl mAb 
class, which could shed light on their differing ability to pro-
mote killing of P. aeruginosa. 
Given the potential for dual mechanisms of action (inhi-
bition of cell attachment and/or OPK activity), we tested 
which activity might be most correlative for protection by 
constructing an Fc mutant of Cam-003, Cam-003-TM, 
which reduces interaction with Fc1 receptors (Oganesyan 
et al., 2008). Cam-003-TM had reduced OPK activity but 
inhibited cell attachment to the same level as the parental 
mAb. When compared in the mouse pneumonia model to 
Cam-003, Cam-003-TM efficacy was inferior, suggesting 
that full competency in the ability to mediate OPK is neces-
sary for optimal anti-Psl-mediated protection against P. aeru-
ginosa in the lung. Although inhibition of cell attachment 
activity may contribute to protection, these data underscore 
OPK activity to the Psl epitope as an important in vivo 
mechanism of action. 
With the promising protection observed with Cam-003 
in multiple and disparate P. aeruginosa mouse models of acute 
infection using multiple P. aeruginosa strains, it was also 
important to further confirm that Psl expression was observed 
in representative clinical isolates from geographically and dis-
ease diverse sources. In this study, we observed Psl expression 
in a high percentage (96%) of clinical isolates derived from 
confirmed acute infections. Although only a small fraction of 
the total cases worldwide are chronic infections in CF 
patients, P. aeruginosa is the direst threat to this patient popu-
lation, as most CF patients eventually succumb to the pro-
gressive damage caused by chronic P. aeruginosa infections. 
Although Psl expression was also observed in a majority of 
both mucoid and nonmucoid CF clinical isolates, overall Psl 
elaboration in diverse CF isolates was less prevalent (73%) 
than observed for acute isolates. The long-term establishment 
of a chronic P. aeruginosa infection in the CF lung occurs by 
a process termed adaptive radiation in which the originally 
infecting strain undergoes a wide variety of genotypic and 
phenotypic changes in the face of antibiotic and host selective 
pressures (Hogardt and Heesemann, 2010). This process re-
sults in both metabolic and antigenic changes, conferring an 
overall advantage for the P. aeruginosa population in the 
diverse microenvironmental niches of the inflamed CF lung 
(Hogardt and Heesemann, 2010). Although this could sug-
gest less potential for anti-Psl monotherapeutic treatment of 
an active CF or other established chronic P. aeruginosa infec-
tions, mounting evidence strongly suggests that in addition to 
the prevalent Psl expression in the primary infecting strain, 
Psl has been implicated in establishing a persistent infection </p>

<p>OPK assays. Assays were performed as previously described, with modifi-
cations (DiGiandomenico et al., 2004). In brief, assays were performed in 
96-well plates using 0.025 ml of each OPK component: P. aeruginosa strains 
from log-phase cultures diluted to 2 × 10 6 cells/ml; diluted baby rabbit 
serum (1:10); differentiated HL-60 cells (2e7 cells/ml) as the polymorpho-
nuclear leukocyte source; and mAb (final concentrations as indicated in Fig. 1). 
In some OPK assays, luminescent P. aeruginosa, which were constructed as 
previously described (Choi et al., 2005). Luminescent OPK assays were per-
formed as previously described (DiGiandomenico et al., 2004), but with de-
termination of relative luciferase units (RLUs) using an Envision Multilabel 
plate reader (PerkinElmer). The percentage of killing was determined by 
comparing the number of colonies or RLUs derived from assays lacking 
mAb to the number of colonies or RLUs obtained from assays with anti-Psl 
mAbs or the control R347 mAb. </p>

Log-phase luminescent PAO1 was added at an MOI of 10. After incuba-
tion at 37°C for 1 h, cells were washed, followed by the addition of 0.05 ml 
of LB + 0.5% glucose. Bacterial RLUs were quantified using an Envision

Measurements from wells without A549 cells were used to correct for 
nonspecific binding. </p>

<p>Flow cytometry based binding assays. Mid-log phase P. aeruginosa 
strains were concentrated in PBS to an OD 650 of 2.0. After incubation of 
antibody (10 µg/ml) and bacteria (1e7 cells) for 1 h at 4°C with shaking, 
washed cells were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-human IgG 
antibody (Invitrogen) for 0.5 h at 4°C. Washed cells were stained with 
BacLight Green Bacterial Stain as recommended (Invitrogen). For ex vivo 
binding, 0.1 ml of bacterial inocula was prepared from an overnight TSA 
plate and delivered intraperitoneally to BALB/c mice. 4 h after challenge, 
bacteria were harvested, and RBCs were lysed, sonicated, and resuspended 
in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 1% BSA. Samples were 
stained and run on an LSR II flow cytometer (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">BD</rs>) and analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">FAC-
SDiva</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v. 6.1.3</rs>; BD) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">FlowJo</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">v. 9.2</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Tree Star</rs>). </p>

<p>Octet measurements. Affinity of antibodies was analyzed using the 
ForteBio Octet 384 instrument with 384 slanted well plates (ForteBio). 
PAO1 was grown overnight at 37°C at 200 RPM, followed by removal of 
cells by centrifugation. The culture supernatant, which served as the Psl 
source, was then loaded onto Octet aminopropylsilane (hydrated in PBS) 
sensors (300 s). The sensors were blocked with PBS-B (300 s), followed by 
the addition of anti-Psl mAbs that ranged from 7.8 to 10,000 nM (400 s). 
Disassociation was performed with PBS-B (400 s). For Octet carbohydrate 
capture experiments, antibodies were loaded onto aminopropylsilane 
(hydrated in PBS) sensors (300 s) at 10 µg/ml, followed by blocking with 
PBS-B (100 s). Enriched carbohydrate solution was then flowed over the 
sensors (300 s), followed by washing to remove unbound material (100 s). 
Unlabeled antibodies (10 µg/ml) were then flowed over the sensors. All 
steps were performed using a 3-mm sensor offset with 0.6 Hz sensitivity. 
Data were exported to <rs id="software-2" type="software">Prism</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">GraphPad</rs>) for analysis of binding and for 
Global Association/Disassociation affinity curve fitting. </p>

<p>In vivo P. aeruginosa models. All procedures were performed in accor-
dance with federal, state, and institutional guidelines and were approved by 
the MedImmune Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in an Asso-
ciation for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Inter-
national-accredited facility. Antibodies or PBS were administered 24 h 
before infection in each model. P. aeruginosa acute pneumonia, keratitis, and 
thermal injury infection models were performed as described (DiGiando-
menico et al., 2007) with modifications. In the acute pneumonia model, 
BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were infected with P. aeruginosa 
strains suspended in a 0.05-ml inoculum. In the thermal injury model, CF-1 
mice (Charles River) received a 10% total body surface area thermal injury </p>

<p>Immuno Tubes (Nunc; MaxiSorp) followed for phage display selections as 
previously described (Vaughan et al., 1996), with the exception of 100 nM 
triethanolamine being used as the elution buffer. For selection on P. aeruginosa 
in suspension, heat-killed cells were blocked, followed by addition of blocked 
phage to cells. After washing, eluted phage was used to infect E. coli cells as 
previously described (Vaughan et al., 1996). Rescue of phage from E. coli and 
binding to heat-killed P. aeruginosa by ELISA was performed as previously 
described (Vaughan et al., 1996). </p>

<p>Expression of scFv and IgG1 antibodies. scFvs were purified from E. coli 
as previously described (Vaughan et al., 1996). For IgG expression, the V H 
and V L chains of selected antibodies were cloned into human IgG1 expres-
sion vectors, coexpressed in HEK293 cells, and purified by protein A affinity 
chromatography as previously described (Persic et al., 1997). </p>

<p>Mice. 6-wk-old wild-type BALB/c and C3H/HeN mice and 10-wk-old 
non-Swiss albino (CD-1) mice were purchased from The Jackson Labo-
ratory. All mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions and fed 
autoclaved rodent feed and water. </p>

<p>P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. 173 unique P. aeruginosa clinical isolates 
were collected from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, University of Pitts-
burgh Medical Center-Mercy Hospital via P. Castric (Duquesne University, 
Pittsburgh, PA), and Seattle Children's Hospital (Seattle, WA) via J. Burns 
(Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA). Strains 6077 and 
6294 were provided by J.B. Goldberg (University of Virginia, Charlottes-
ville, VA). </p>

<p>Indirect and competition ELISAs. ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp) were 
coated with P. aeruginosa strains from overnight cultures, as previously de-
scribed (DiGiandomenico et al., 2004). Diluted antibodies were added to PBS 
+ 1% BSA (PBS-B)-blocked plates for 1 h, washed with PBS supplemented 
with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and treated with HRP-conjugated anti-
human secondary antibodies for 1 h, followed by development and analysis as 
previously described (Ulbrandt et al., 2006). For competition ELISA, antibod-
ies were biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin and Biotinylation 
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Unbound biotin was removed using a Zeba 
Spin 7 MWCO desalting column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Antigen-coated 
plates were treated with the EC 50 of biotinylated antibodies co-incubated 
with unlabeled antibodies. After incubation with HRP-conjugated strepta-
vidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), plates were developed as previously described 
(Ulbrandt et al., 2006). </p>

<p>Isolation of P. aeruginosa mutants by allelic exchange and mutant 
complementation. P. aeruginosa mutants were constructed based on the 
allele replacement strategy previously described by Schweizer (1993, 1992). 
Vectors were mobilized from E. coli strain S17.1 into P. aeruginosa strain 
PAO1; recombinants were isolated as described (Hoang et al., 1998). Gene 
deletion was confirmed by PCR. P. aeruginosa mutants were complemented 
with pUCP30T-based constructs harboring wild-type genes. </p>

<p>Enrichment of Psl exopolysaccharide from P. aeruginosa overnight 
cultures. Psl was enriched from P. aeruginosa cell culture supernatant based 
on the method described by Byrd et al. (2009) with modifications. In brief, 
PAO1wbpL/algD/pelA (O-antigen-, alginate-, and Pel exopolysaccharide-
deficient) triple mutant was grown by shaking at 37°C for 18 h in M63 min-
imal medium ([NH 4 ] 2 SO 4 , 2 g/l; KH 2 PO 4 , 13.6 g/l; FeCl 3 , 0.5 mg/l, pH 7) 
supplemented with 0.5% Casaminoacids (BD), 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.2% glu-
cose. After removing P. aeruginosa cells by centrifugation, the culture super-
natant was concentrated through a 3K Tangential flow filtration membrane 
(Pall), washed extensively with PBS, and lyophilized. Lyophilized material 
was suspended in distilled water and treated with proteinase K for 60 min at 
60°C. The enriched Psl extract was subjected to anti-Psl antibody capture by 
ELISA and the Octet platform. </p>
