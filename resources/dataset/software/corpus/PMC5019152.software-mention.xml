<p>ABSTRACT </p>

<p>Purpose To develop the infrastructure to conduct timely active surveillance for safety of influenza vaccines and other medical countermea-
sures in the Sentinel System (formerly the Mini-Sentinel Pilot), a Food and Drug Administration-sponsored national surveillance system that 
typically relies on data that are mature, settled, and updated quarterly. 
Methods Three Data Partners provided their earliest available ("fresh") cumulative claims data on influenza vaccination and health out-
comes 3-4 times on a staggered basis during the 2013-2014 influenza season, collectively producing 10 data updates. We monitored ana-
phylaxis in the entire population using a cohort design and seizures in children ≤4 years of age using both a self-controlled risk interval 
design (primary) and a cohort design (secondary). After each data update, we conducted sequential analysis for inactivated (IIV) and live 
(LAIV) influenza vaccines using the Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test, adjusting for data-lag. 
Results Most of the 10 sequential analyses were conducted within 6 weeks of the last care-date in the cumulative dataset. A total of 
6 682 336 doses of IIV and 782 125 doses of LAIV were captured. The primary analyses did not identify any statistical signals following 
IIV or LAIV. In secondary analysis, the risk of seizures was higher following concomitant IIV and PCV13 than historically after IIV in 
6-to 23-month-olds (relative risk = 2.7), which requires further investigation. 
Conclusions The Sentinel System can implement a sequential analysis system that uses fresh data for medical product safety surveillance. 
Active surveillance using sequential analysis of fresh data holds promise for detecting clinically significant health risks early. Limitations of 
employing fresh data for surveillance include cost and the need for careful scrutiny of signals. The H1N1 pandemic of 2009 created an urgent need to 
stand up multiple vaccine safety surveillance systems 
to support public health efforts to safely vaccinate the </p>

<p>of 2009, using data from large health insurers and state 
immunization registries. 
1,8 A major challenge was the 
critical need to obtain and analyze recent data on a 
frequent basis in order to detect safety problems in 
time to intervene, as influenza vaccines are typically 
given within a short span of time. </p>

<p>9   Subsequently, FDA wished to determine the feasi-
bility of conducting timely sequential analysis for 
influenza vaccine safety as an integral part of the 
Sentinel System (formerly the Mini-Sentinel Pilot 
10 ). 
Currently, Sentinel data are refreshed on a quarterly 
basis and contain relatively settled and complete 
data, the most recent of which are 6-9 months old. 
The time required for data to settle would limit the 
ability to inform regulatory decisions about the use 
of influenza vaccine in a timely manner. The goal 
was to access, use, and evaluate fresh data for timely 
influenza vaccine safety surveillance in the Sentinel 
population in order to develop a potentially sustain-
able infrastructure to apply to other FDA-regulated 
medical products requiring faster access to safety 
information. </p>

<p>METHODS </p>

<p>Study periods, populations, and data sources </p>

<p>The 2012-2013 influenza season was used to pilot and 
evaluate the system. We conducted actual surveillance 
for influenza vaccine safety in 2013-2014, incorporat-
ing data from 1 September 2013 to 30 April 2014. 
Aetna, HealthCore (with WellPoint/Anthem data), 
and Humana ("Data Partners") provided claims data 
on vaccine exposures and health outcomes of interest. 
Additional immunization data for Data Partner mem-
bers were obtained from eight participating immuniza-
tion registries: Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New 
York City, New York State, Pennsylvania, Virginia, 
and Wisconsin. </p>

<p>Data processing </p>

<p>The source files were internal member-level files at 
each Data Partner that included only claims that were 
adjudicated or, if no reimbursement was expected, 
recorded. They were refreshed by Data Partners in 
the last half of each month and normally included 
data on healthcare events through the end of the prior 
calendar month. Approximately every 2 months, 3-4 
times during 2013-2014, each Data Partner translated 
their source files to standard-format patient-level files 
including all medical and pharmacy claims with 
service/fill dates ≥ 1 September 2012. A distributed 
<rs type="software">SAS</rs> program aggregated data into a vaccine file and </p>

<p>a diagnosis file, each with a summary count of the cu-
mulative number of members in each stratum defined 
by week of vaccination, age group, sex, and other 
variables. 
Data Partners provided lists of enrolled members as 
of October 2013 to the eight participating registries 
once during 2013-2014. The registries returned avail-
able immunization data for members, which Data 
Partners converted into a standard format. Immunization 
registry data were incorporated into the last generation 
of each Data Partner's aggregate data for 2013-2014. 
Data refreshes were staggered among the Data 
Partners, and sequential analysis was conducted after 
each, for a total of 10 analyses over the course of the 
season. </p>

<p>Vaccine exposures </p>

<p>Vaccination was ascertained by CPT, CVX, HCPCS, 
and NDC codes. We conducted separate sequential 
analyses for live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) 
and for pooled inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV). 
NDC codes are highly specific, while other coding 
systems have been less so. All inactivated influenza 
vaccines were combined for sequential analysis, 
given that the counts of health outcomes of interest 
after specific vaccines were expected to be too low 
to produce interpretable results in separate statistical 
analyses. </p>

<p>Health outcomes of interest </p>

<p>We monitored the risk of two health outcomes, ana-
phylaxis and seizures. The case-finding algorithms 
are shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. 
A previous Mini-Sentinel study had found a positive 
predictive value of 69% for the anaphylaxis algo-
rithm. 
11 The seizures algorithm had a positive predic-
tive value of 70% for febrile seizures in a PRISM 
study of children 6-59 months of age. 
12 Because the 
increase in risk of febrile seizures following IIV was 
greater among children receiving concomitant pneu-
mococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in the risk vs. 
the control period in 2010-2011 in the VSD system, </p>

<p>13   we stratified seizures in the 6-to 23-month-old age 
group by the presence/absence of concomitant 
PCV13. We also monitored seizures in the 24-to 59-
month-old age group. </p>

<p>Sequential analysis designs and statistical methods </p>

<p>We used a cohort design ("current-vs.-historical com-
parison") for anaphylaxis. The cumulative number of 
cases in a pre-specified risk interval following </p>

<p>vaccination was compared with the number expected 
based on historical rates after vaccination. 
6 This 
approach has often been used in sequential analysis 
for rare outcomes, because it has better power than 
comparisons with concurrent controls, including the 
self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) approach described 
below. 
14 A limitation of the current-vs.-historical ap-
proach is that historical influenza vaccinees may not 
be an entirely appropriate comparison group for influ-
enza vaccinees in the season of interest because of dif-
ferent population characteristics, secular trends in 
coded health outcomes, different concomitant vaccines, 
and/or differences in influenza vaccines over time. 
For seizures, we designated the SCRI design </p>

<p>5,6,13,15,16   as primary. The SCRI design is a special (and simpler) 
case of both the case-crossover 
17 and the self-controlled 
case series 
18 designs. The cumulative numbers of cases 
in pre-specified risk and control intervals are compared, 
adjusting for unequal interval lengths. The analysis is 
conditioned on the individual, and only those with a 
seizure in either the risk or the control interval contribute 
to the analysis. This self-controlled design is our pre-
ferred approach for influenza vaccine safety monitoring, 
because it controls for all fixed potential confounders, 
such as sex and co-morbidities. A limitation of the 
method is that time-varying confounders, such as age 
and seasonality, may bias the findings. However, 
such confounding was mitigated here by the less-
than-3-week-long follow-up period (Table 1). Another 
limitation is that for rare outcomes, power to detect 
signals in a timely fashion may be low, particularly if 
the effect size is modest. We used current-vs.-historical 
comparison as a secondary method for seizures to 
detect any increased risk earlier than would have 
been possible with the SCRI method alone. 
Three different variants of the Maximized Sequential 
Probability Ratio Test (maxSPRT) were used, which ad-
justed for the repeated looks at the accumulating data 
entailed in sequential analysis: the maxSPRT for 
Poisson data, 
3 the maxSPRT for binomial data, 
3 and 
the conditional maxSPRT (CmaxSPRT) for Poisson 
data. 
4 The test statistic was the log-likelihood ratio 
(LLR). One-tailed tests were used, because we were 
looking only for elevated risks from vaccination rather 
than for protective effects; alpha was set at 0.05. These 
tests and their inputs are elaborated upon elsewhere. </p>

<p>19   The details of the various sequential analyses and com-
parisons are summarized in Table 1. </p>

<p>Adjustment for incomplete data in sequential analysis </p>

<p>We conducted analyses using fresh data in order to ob-
tain timely results. However, fresh data are typically </p>

<p>incomplete because of delays in the submission and 
processing of medical claims. We used documented 
data lag adjustments. 
21 To characterize lag times, each 
Data Partner quantified claims data accrual in early 
2012 by week after care date for each medical setting. 
For the current-vs.-historical (Poisson and CmaxSPRT) 
analysis, we multiplied the expected by the fraction of 
data projected to have arrived, according to these data-
lag characterizations, to adjust the expected. For the 
self-controlled (binomial maxSPRT) analysis, we ex-
cluded from analysis events in the risk and control inter-
vals associated with a vaccination week until data for 
both intervals were determined to be ≥85% complete, 
according to the data-lag characterizations. Among the 
three Data Partners, the number of weeks needed to 
achieve ≥85% completeness was 7-13 for the emergency 
department setting and 10-18 for the inpatient setting. </p>

<p>Signal investigation </p>

<p>To investigate a signal, we conducted logistic re-
gression analysis of IIV vaccinees in 2012-2013 and 
2013-2014, adjusting for Data Partner, week of sea-
son, age, sex, dose, and season. </p>

<p>Evaluation </p>

<p>An evaluation of the fresh data was conducted, re-
ported on separately. </p>

<p>19   RESULTS </p>

<p>The Data Partners provided cumulative refreshed data 
3-4 times each, on a staggered schedule. One to two 
sequential analyses were conducted each month be-
tween December 2013 and May 2014, each analysis 
incorporating new data from one Data Partner. Figure 
S1 in the Supporting Information shows the sequence 
of tests conducted. Analyses were routinely conducted 
by approximately 6 weeks after the last care date in the 
respective batch of data. </p>

<p>19   A total of 6 682 336 doses of IIV and 782 125 doses 
of LAIV had been captured by the end of surveillance 
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The propor-
tion contributed by immunization registries was 4.3%. 
Current-vs.-historical design: A statistical signal 
appeared for seizures in 6-to 23-month-olds receiving 
IIV with concomitant PCV13 in Test #7, conducted in 
March 2014. There were nine cases observed among 
86 329 concomitant vaccinees, a relative risk (RR) of 
3.0, and a LLR of 3.978, surpassing the critical value. 
By Test #10, now with 12 cases observed among 
116 133 concomitant vaccinees, the RR had decreased 
slightly to 2.7 (Table 2 and Figure 1). There were no </p>

<p>other signals for IIV, nor any for LAIV. Fifteen cases 
of anaphylaxis after IIV had appeared by Test #10, 
compared with 23.7 expected, for a RR of 0.63; there 
were 0 cases after LAIV. 
SCRI design: For each stratum, data in the control 
window had to be ≥85% complete before any cases 
could be analyzed. This, together with the pre-
specified minimum of four cases in risk plus control 
windows in order to do an analysis, 
19 meant that no 
SCRI analysis was possible until Test #7, conducted 
after most of the influenza vaccine for the season 
had been administered. No statistical signals 
emerged in SCRI analysis. Regarding seizures in 
6-to 23-month-olds receiving concomitant IIV and 
PCV13, in the last SCRI analysis, there were four 
cases in the risk interval, 10 in the control interval, 
a RR of 1.4, and a LLR well below the signaling 
threshold (Table 2 and Figure 1). 
In investigating the seizures signal, we found that 
6-to 23-month-old children receiving concomitant 
IIV and PCV13 had a greater risk of seizures in the 
0-1 days following vaccination compared with those 
receiving IIV without concomitant PCV13, with an 
adjusted OR of 3.1 (95% CI: 1.7, 5.9; p = 0.0004). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>This surveillance effort demonstrates the feasibility of 
conducting vaccine safety surveillance for important 
public health outcomes using healthcare data as recent 
as 6 weeks old. These fresh data, which could be 
updated on a monthly basis, allow more frequent sta-
tistical testing and faster signal detection. The fresh-
ness and updating frequency of these fresh data 
streams hold promise for monitoring the safety of 
products whose evaluation could substantially benefit 
from a 6-to 9-month lead-time over standard Sentinel 
data. 
The statistical signal for seizures in 6-to 23-month-old 
children after IIV and concomitant PCV13 vaccina-
tion seen in the secondary analysis merits further 
investigation. The comparison group was IIV vacci-
nees (largely without concomitant PCV13) in prior 
seasons. No statistical signal was seen in the primary, 
SCRI analysis, which compared the risk between ex-
posed and unexposed time from the same concomitant 
vaccinees. Although our signal investigation found 
that 6-to 23-month-old concomitant vaccinees had a 
greater risk of post-vaccination seizures compared to 
those receiving IIV without PCV13, this was not a 
self-controlled analysis and thus was subject to poten-
tial residual confounding. Moreover, the analysis was 
not designed to examine the effect of PCV13 vaccina-
tion by itself. </p>

<p>Historical data on anaphylaxis after LAIV are typically very sparse, so post-IIV historical rates were used instead of post-LAIV historical rates. </p>

<p>20 </p>

<p> § </p>

<p>Control window starts a multiple of 7 days after start of risk window to minimize bias from day-of-week effects. Control window starts 2 weeks (instead of 1 week) after vaccination in order to exclude 
period of increased risk of seizures after MMR or MMRV vaccination. (This is less relevant for the 24-to 59-month age group, but control windows were kept similar for consistency.) </p>

<p> ¶ </p>

<p>The historical rates used were from prior to July 2010, which is also largely prior to any concomitant PCV13 usage. The purpose of this restriction was to exclude influenza seasons in which the risk of 
post-IIV seizure was elevated and to exclude most concomitant PCV13. </p>

<p>Indications have emerged of a possible increased risk 
of febrile seizures after IIV vaccination in young chil-
dren in the U.S. in some prior seasons. 
13,22,23 Given 
the usual annual change in influenza vaccine antigenic 
composition, the relevance of results from earlier sea-
sons to our finding of 2013-2014 is unclear. PRISM 
did not find a statistically significant elevated risk for 
febrile seizures in the 2010-2011 season. 
12 VSD found 
an increased risk of seizure after IIV in 2010-2011 </p>

<p>13   and 2011-2012 
23 (in which seasons the antigenic 
composition of the vaccine was the same) but not in 
2012-2013 
23 or 2013-2014. 
24 In 2013-2014, unlike 
PRISM, VSD did not stratify the exposure for the 6-to 
23-month-olds into IIV with and IIV without concomi-
tant PCV13. This difference may explain the apparently 
different findings between the two systems that season 
-indeed, if we pool our 6-to 23-month-old IIV 
vaccinees (i.e. without regard to concomitant PCV13), 
the number of observed cases is 20 vs. 18.38 expected, 
for a RR of 1.09 (derived from Table 2, Analysis #10). 
(In the future, when the safety of the same vaccine is 
to be monitored by more than one system, it would be 
worthwhile to harmonize certain features of the 
methods, such as exposure and health outcome defini-
tions, so as to facilitate comparison and interpretation 
of the results. Although a case could be made for 
combining data to maximize statistical power, compar-
ing results from different observational studies and 
designs can be informative, after which meta-analysis 
can be employed to obtain a composite result. </p>

<p>25   ) 
The independent risks of IIV and PCV13 with re-
spect to seizures will be examined in a separate 
study, 
26 using the SCRI design retrospectively on ma-
ture data and implementing adjustments similar to 
those used in the PRISM study of 2010-2011 IIV. </p>

<p>12   Although the signal did not appear until Analysis 7, 
conducted on 10 March 2014, 
19 it is worth consider-
ing if and when the system would have signaled 
under circumstances of a true increased risk of the 
magnitude found for Fluvax and Fluvax Junior in 
Australia in 2010. The ratio of observed to expected 
in that instance was approximately 9. 
27 This is an 
important example, because the risk identified was 
sufficiently high to result in changes to Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices recommen-
dations for the U.S.-equivalent of the Fluvax vaccine 
(Afluria, CSL Limited) 
27 and to lead to label changes 
mentioning the seizures risk and restricting the FDA-
approved usage of Afluria to children aged 5 years or 
older. 
28 Through simulations, we found that, if the 
true RR of seizures among 6-to 23-month-olds re-
ceiving concomitant IIV and PCV13 vaccines had 
been 9, as it was for Fluvax, the probability of seeing a </p>

<p>signal would have been 90% by Analysis 4 (Figure 2), 
which was conducted on 9 January 2014. 
19 By Analy-
sis 6, conducted on 18 February 2014, 
19 the power to 
see a signal in the case of a true RR as low as 4 
was almost 80%. 
Instead of restricting ourselves to the relatively 
small group of 6-to 23-month-olds receiving 
PCV13 concomitantly with IIV in which our signal 
occurred, we could consider all 6-to 23-month-olds, 
summing the expected counts for the children with 
IIV with and without concomitant PCV13 and </p>

<p>repeating the simulations. As can be seen in the 
resulting Figure 3, the probability of detecting a 
signal for a given true RR was higher at earlier looks 
than in Figure 2. For example, by Look 4 the probabil-
ity of detecting a signal in the case of a true RR as low 
as 4 was 90%. 
There are some significant limitations to conducting 
surveillance using fresh, frequently updated data, par-
ticularly for influenza vaccine safety monitoring. One 
is cost. Processing, quality-checking, and analyzing 
fresh data were resource-intensive for both Data Partners </p>

<p>Figure 1. Trajectories of IIV doses, seizure relative risks (RRs), and log likelihood ratios (LLRs) for 6-to 23-month-olds with concomitant PCV13 over the 
course of sequential analysis. The LLR was set to 0 where RR &lt; 1. CvsH refers to the current vs. historical analysis, SCRI to the self-controlled risk interval 
analysis. The LLR critical values for the two analysis methods were too close to distinguish from each other; the horizontal purple line represents the LLR 
critical values (CV) of both. A statistical signal emerged from the current vs. historical analysis in Test #7, and the RR was 2.7 by Test #10. No statistical 
signal appeared with the SCRI analysis; the RR at Test #10 was 1.4 </p>

old IIV+PCV13 concomitant vaccinees in 2013-2014 and a required minimum-number-of-observed-cases-to-signal of 3. The midpoint of the color scale, yel-
low, was set to correspond to 0.50, such that values &gt;0.50 are greenish and values &lt;0.50 are reddish. * The expected count at each look was based on Data 
Partner-specific background rates and the cumulative number of IIV doses administered concomitantly with PCV13 to 6-to 23-month-olds as of that look, with 
data lag adjustment applied. </p>

<p>and coordinating center because of the non-routine 
nature of the work and the frequency of data-processing. 
To institutionalize such a system would require develop-
ing new infrastructure capabilities. Doing so would 
lower the incremental cost of monitoring additional prod-
ucts. Another problem is the unpredictability of events 
affecting data quality and timeliness. Although two seri-
ous data quality problems were found and resolved dur-
ing the 2012-2013 pilot season, there were a number of 
system-wide changes or other events at the Data Partners 
in the 2013-2014 surveillance season, 
19 which, if not 
noticed and addressed, would have affected data quality 
and which did lead to delays in data provision. Related 
to the dynamic, unsettled nature of fresh data, using such 
data requires particularly careful scrutiny of statistical 
signals. The comparison of fresh vs. mature data for the 
2012-2013 season identified some differences in dose 
counts, case counts, and risk estimates between the two 
data types. 
19 Risk estimates were more divergent 
between fresh and mature data for SCRI analyses than 
for current-vs.-historical analyses. These differences 
between results from fresh and mature data were likely 
related to low case counts in the SCRI analysis and con-
sequent instability of risk estimates. Inaccuracies in the 
lag adjustment might have been a factor, too, considering 
that the lag characterization was necessarily conducted 
on older data, and timeliness of claims data-processing 
may have changed. 
Finally, suboptimal statistical power and time to signal 
can be a concern, especially for influenza vaccine safety 
surveillance, where the period of vaccine administration 
is so compressed. Even with the more timely current-
vs.-historical analysis, the statistical signal for seizures 
in 6-to 23-month-old concomitant IIV and PCV13 vacci-
nees was not discovered until March 2014, after the </p>

<p>influenza season was essentially over. Statistical power 
and time-to-signal would be more favorable if the sample 
size were larger, achievable with a larger surveillance sys-
tem (more data partners), longer surveillance, a wider age 
range, or a more common outcome. Longer surveillance 
seems a particularly feasible option where products other 
than influenza vaccine are concerned. 
Notwithstanding concerns about statistical power, 
sequential surveillance using fresh data may be valu-
able to public health agencies, not necessarily because 
the system can identify the smallest risks early (which 
it may not be able to) but because it can function as a 
safety net to ensure that the largest and most clinically 
significant health risks be detected as early as possible. 
The potential for detecting clinically significant risks 
in a timely fashion, even in a quite small age group, 
is illustrated by Figures 2 and 3. The true advantage 
of fresh data is best viewed by comparing a surveil-
lance system that can detect safety concerns at levels 
that might impact policy just months after initial 
product uptake with a system using mature data that 
must wait a year or more to assess the safety of a 
product. </p>

<p>KEY POINTS </p>

<p>• Although the FDA Sentinel System routinely uses </p>

<p>mature data for its medical product safety surveil-
lance, it can obtain and analyze "fresher" data as re-
cent as 6 weeks after the last care date in the batch. </p>

<p>• Sequential analysis of successive, cumulative </p>

<p>batches of fresh data offers the potential for detect-
ing clinically significant risks in a more timely 
fashion than with mature data, even in smaller de-
mographic subgroups. This holds promise for 
monitoring the safety of influenza vaccines and 
other medical countermeasures. </p>

<p>• Limitations of employing fresh data for near </p>

<p>real-time surveillance include the costs associ-
ated with frequently updating and checking the 
quality of the fresh data and the need for careful 
scrutiny of signals. </p>
