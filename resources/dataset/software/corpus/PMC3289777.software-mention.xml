<p>Background: The identification of molds in clinical laboratories is largely on the basis of 
phenotypic criteria, the classification of which can be subjective. Recently, molecular meth-
ods have been introduced for identification of pathogenic molds in clinical settings. Here, 
we employed comparative sequence analysis to identify molds. </p>

<p>Methods: A total of 47 clinical mold isolates were used in this study, including Aspergillus 
and Trichophyton. All isolates were identified by phenotypic properties, such as growth 
rate, colony morphology, and reproductive structures. PCR and direct sequencing, target-
ing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the D1/D2 region of the 28S subunit, and 
the ß-tubulin gene, were performed using primers described previously. Comparative se-
quence analysis by using the GenBank database was performed with the basic local align-
ment search tool (<rs type="software">BLAST</rs>) algorithm. </p>

<p>Results: For Aspergillus, 56% and 67% of the isolates were identified to the species level by 
using ITS and ß-tubulin analysis, respectively. Only D1/D2 analysis was useful for Trichophy-
ton identification, with 100% of isolates being identified to the species level. Performances 
of ITS and D1/D2 analyses were comparable for species-level identification of molds other 
than Aspergillus and Trichophyton. In contrast, the efficacy of ß-tubulin analysis was limited 
to genus identification because of the paucity of database information for this gene. </p>

<p>Conclusions: The molecular methods employed in this study were valuable for mold iden-
tification, although the different loci used had variable usefulness, according to mold ge-
nus. Thus, a tailored approach is recommended when selecting amplification targets for 
molecular identification of molds. </p>

<p>The epidemiology and etiology of invasive fungal infections have 
changed over recent decades. Mold infections are more fre-
quently encountered in association with increasing numbers of 
immunocompromised patients, and molds other than Aspergillus 
fumigatus, including species not previously recognized as patho-
gens, have emerged [1, 2]. The appearance of organisms, such 
as the Fusarium species and the Zygomycetes, with variable sus-</p>

<p>ceptibilities to conventional antifungal agents underscores the 
importance of correct identification [3]. 
Clinical laboratories are often challenged with mold identifica-
tion. In contrast with bacterial or Candida species, which are 
identified on the basis of biochemical properties, mold identifi-
cation is largely based on phenotypic criteria. Related species or 
phenotypic variants may be misidentified and rare species may 
remain unidentified. As a result, molecular methods have been 
developed to overcome these problems, and comparative se-</p>

<p>quence analysis is now considered the gold standard identifica-
tion technique [4, 5]. 
The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region is the most com-
monly used target for sequencing in clinical laboratories because 
of the following benefits: (i) multiple copies of the ribosomal gene 
are present in all organisms, enabling sensitive detection by PCR, 
and (ii) the ITS region contains both highly conserved and vari-
able regions, and is therefore, the optimal target for developing 
specific PCR primers that discriminate among closely related 
species [6-9]. However, the ITS region might not provide spe-
cies-level resolution for all species. In such cases, other targets 
such as the D1/D2 region of the 28S subunit, the ß-tubulin gene, 
or the translation elongation factor gene may prove useful, de-
pending on the genus in question. In this study, we used molec-
ular methods for mold identification and compared the perfor-
mances of the ITS region, the D1/D2 region, and the ß-tubulin 
gene as amplification targets for comparative sequence analysis. </p>

<p>METHODS </p>

<p>Forty-seven preserved isolates, which were previously obtained 
from clinical specimens, were cultivated to evaluate the useful-
ness of each locus for mold identification. Isolate selection crite-
ria were as follows: (i) isolates most frequently recovered in our 
laboratory, (ii) medically important isolates recovered infrequently, 
or (iii) isolates unidentifiable by phenotypic methods. The gen-
era included in this study were Absidia (1), Acremonium (1), 
Aspergillus (9), Cladosporium (2), Cunninghamella (1), Exophi-
ala (1), Fusarium (2), Paecilomyces (3), Microsporum (1), Peni-
cillium (3), Rhizomucor (1), Rhizopus (1), Scopulariopsis (1), 
Scedosporium (1), Sporothrix (2), Trichophyton (9), and uniden-
tifiable molds (8). </p>

<p>1. Conventional identification </p>

<p>Clinical specimens were cultured on universal media (Sabouraud 
dextrose agar) and/or selective media (Mycogel agar) for a maxi-
mum of 3 weeks, according to the type of specimen. Specimens 
were incubated at 30°C for the first 2 days and then at 25°C. Iso-
lates were sub-cultured for identification on Sabouraud dextrose 
agar or potato dextrose agar. Presumptive thermally dimorphic 
fungi were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25°C and brain 
heart infusion agar at 37°C. Conventional identification was made 
according to macro-and micro-morphologic criteria. </p>

<p>2. DNA extraction </p>

<p>DNA was extracted using the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit </p>

<p>III (bacteria, fungi) (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). 
Fungal mycelium with a surface area of 2-4 cm 
2 was obtained, </p>

<p>added to phosphate buffered saline, and samples were prepared 
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, ap-
proximately 100 µL of sample was mixed with 130 µL of bacterial 
lysis buffer and 20 µL of proteinase K, incubated at 95°C for 10 
min and then cooled. After sample preparation DNA was iso-
lated using magnetic-bead technology, according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. </p>

<p>3. Amplification and sequencing </p>

<p>PCR was performed using a thermal cycler (Model 9700; Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and amplified products were 
sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready 
Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI Prism 3100 Ge-
netic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences used in 
this study were the same as those given in the Clinical and Labo-
ratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines: (i) sequences of the 
ITS region covering ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 were amplified using 
ITS-1/ITS-4 and ITS-5/ITS-4 primer sets; (ii) sequences of the 
D1/D2 region were amplified using NL-1/NL-4 primers; and (iii) 
ß-tubulin gene sequences were amplified using Bt2a/T1 primers. </p>

<p>4. Sequence analysis </p>

<p>The amplified sequences were compared with the GenBank 
(NCBI) database using the basic local alignment search tool 
(<rs type="software">BLAST</rs>) algorithm. Using a calculated percent identity score, 
specimens were assigned to a genus and species, as previously 
described [6, 7]. Briefly, a sequence was assigned to a species 
if the best matching reference sequence showed ≥ 98% homol-
ogy and the next best matching reference species showed 0.8%, 
or less, sequence homology. A sequence was assigned to the 
genus level on the basis of 95% to 98% homology to the best 
matching sequence or ≥ 98% homology with sequence entries 
for several species from the same genus. 'No identification' was 
defined as &lt; 95% homology with the best matching reference 
sequence or a sequence homology &gt; 95% with various genera. 
Discrepant results between phenotypic and sequence-based 
identification methods were resolved by repeating the sequenc-
ing and re-evaluation of the phenotypic method. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Phenotypic identification and sequencing results for the 3 tar-
gets are shown in Table 1. For Aspergillus, 56% (5/9 isolates) 
and 67% (6/9 isolates) were identified to the species level by ITS </p>

<p>and ß-tubulin analysis, respectively. None of the isolates was 
identified to the species level by D1/D2 analysis alone. Only D1/ 
D2 analysis enabled species-level identification for Trichophyton 
isolates, with 100% of isolates being identified to the species level. 
ITS and D1/D2 targets yielded comparable performances in iden-
tification of molds, other than Aspergillus and Trichophyton. 
There was a discrepancy between phenotypic identification 
and ITS analysis at the genus level for some isolates. Isolate 14 
was identified as a Cunninghamella bertholletiae based on typi-
cal microscopic features, such as non-septate hyphae, sporan-
giophores, terminal vesicles, sporangioles, and the knowledge 
that C. bertholletiae is the only known human pathogen. How-
ever, ITS analysis matched the isolate to Nectria mauritiicola. 
D1/D2 analysis assigned the isolate to the Cunninghamella ge-
nus, although species-level identification was not possible using 
this target. Isolate 19, phenotypically identified as a Paecilomy-
ces species, was re-classified into Geosmithia argillacea on the 
basis of our molecular analyses. Interestingly, isolate 44, pheno-
typically unidentifiable, was also classified as G. argillacea. The </p>

<p>2 isolates were recovered from a trans-tracheal aspirate and lung 
tissue, respectively. Isolate 30 was phenotypically identified as 
Sporothrix schenkii, while D1/D2 analysis matched the isolate to 
Saccharomycopsis fibuligera. However, after re-evaluating the 
phenotypic method, the isolate was finally confirmed as S. schen-
kii exhibiting thermal dimorphism. 
Five of 8 phenotypically unidentifiable isolates were newly iden-
tified as Coniosporium sp. (isolate 43), G. argillacea (isolate 44), 
Phialophora sp. (isolate 45), and Trichophyton rubrum (isolates </p>

<p>46, 47) by sequence analysis. The 3 remaining isolates were still 
unidentifiable by sequence analysis. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>In this study, we employed a molecular method for mold identi-
fication and compared the performance of the 3 commonly 
used amplification targets. Using this method, 2 genera previ-
ously unidentified in a clinical laboratory were discovered, Co-
niosporium and Geosmithia. The Coniosporium species isolate 
was a slow-growing, black pigmented fungus recovered from a 
toenail, and showed arthroconidia microscopically. Coniospo-
rium, which is known to colonize plants, has been reported in 
the literature as a human pathogen recovered from a superficial 
skin lesion [10]. The isolates identified as G. argillacea grew as 
whitish to olive colonies and had phialides, which were difficult 
to distinguish from those of Penicillium or Paecilomyces. Geos-
mithia is a polyphyletic genus created to accommodate Penicil-</p>

<p>lium species that do not produce green colonies. According to 
recent reports [11, 12], G. argillacea can colonize the respiratory 
tract of cystic fibrosis patients, although it was not found to be 
associated with exacerbation of the disease. One of our isolates 
was obtained from the trans-tracheal aspirate of an acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia patient with influenza H1N1 infection, and 
the other isolate was obtained from the lung tissue of a patient 
with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis. Additional re-
search is required to determine the clinical implications of colo-
nization with G. argillacea. 
ITS and D1/D2 region analyses performed well for identifica-
tion of most isolates in this study. However, D1/D2 analysis was 
not appropriate for species-level identification of Aspergillus 
species, and this finding is consistent with the results of a previ-
ous study [13]. In contrast to D1/D2 analysis, where all species 
yielded 100% identical sequence data for at least one molecular 
sibling (closely related but different taxa), the ITS analysis distin-
guished some of the species (A. fumigates, A. terreus) from their 
molecular siblings. The ß-tubulin gene was also helpful for some 
species (A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. sydowii). In contrast, D1/D2 
analysis was more appropriate than that of ITS for identifying 
Trichophyton species. Interestingly, isolates morphologically iden-
tified as T. mentagrophytes were re-classified into T. interdigitale 
(Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii) after analysis of the D1/D2 re-
gion, according to the current taxonomy suggested by Graser et 
al. [14]. The sequence of these isolates was identical to the neo-
type of T. interdigitale, CBS 428.63 (AF506033), but not with the 
neotype of T. mentagrophytes, CBS 318.56 (AY185126). Although 
the naming of the T. mentagrophytes complex has been a topic 
of debate for years, use of T. mentagrophytes rather than T. in-
terdigitale could result in confusion, an issue recently raised in 
the literature [15, 16]. A consensus on the taxonomy of the T. 
mentagrophytes complex must be reached as soon as possible. 
ITS and D1/D2 analyses yielded comparable performances 
for identification of species other than Aspergillus and Tricho-
phyton. ß-tubulin analysis was limited to genus-level identifica-
tion due of the paucity of database information available for this 
gene. Since there is a variety of reference sequences deposited 
in the public database, the ITS region may be the most appro-
priate primary sequencing target, except in the case of Aspergil-
lus, as recommended by the CLSI [17]. Analysis of the D1/D2 
region or ß-tubulin gene could be used for further resolution, 
and the decision to use additional targets should be based on 
clinical implications and laboratory policies, since the relevance 
of species-level identification has only been determined for a 
limited number of genera [18, 19]. In summary, molecular meth-</p>

tailored approach is recommended when selecting amplification
