<p>OBJECTIVE -To examine the relationship between Zn nutritive status and biochemical 
markers of bone turnover in type 1 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -Serum osteocalcin, urine N-telopeptides, 
and dietary intake data, obtained by 3-day food records, were assessed for 66 individuals with 
type 1 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESULTS -Zn intake correlated with osteocalcin in the group overall (r ϭ 0.48; P Ͻ 0.001) 
but not with N-telopeptides. Examined by sex, both Zn and osteocalcin correlated for men (r ϭ 
0.57; P Ͻ 0.001), but the correlation did not reach statistical significance for women (r ϭ 
0.34; P ϭ 0.09). A direct-entry linear regression model with osteocalcin as the dependent 
variable was performed. Duration, sex, A1C, insulin use per kilogram, total calorie intake, 
and Zn intake were entered as potential independent variables. The model was statistically 
significant (R 
2 ϭ 0.32; P Ͻ 0.01). Zn intake (P Ͻ 0.001), however, was the only independent 
correlate of osteocalcin. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -This study provides evidence of a positive relationship between Zn 
intake and osteocalcin in type 1 diabetes. </p>

<p>Z </p>

<p>inc is important in bone metabolism 
(1). Work in cell cultures and ani-
mal models have shown stimulation 
of osteoblasts by Zn (2), while osteoclastic 
cell formation was inhibited (3). Reduced 
Zn levels associated with decreased bone 
mineral content have been observed for 
type 1 diabetic individuals (4). To our 
knowledge, there have been no studies in 
type 1 diabetes that examine Zn nutritive 
status and biochemical markers of bone 
turnover. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODS -Type 1 diabetic par-
ticipants (n ϭ 66; mean Ϯ SD age 42 Ϯ 
10 years) were evaluated in the Human 
Performance Laboratory, University of 
Delaware, Newark, Delaware. This 
study had the approval of the institu-</p>

<p>tional review board of the University of 
Delaware. Individuals with possible 
secondary causes of osteoporosis (e.g., 
hyperparathyroidism) were excluded, 
although seven did have borderline de-
creased vitamin D levels but normal 
parathyroid hormone levels. Analysis of 
the data omitting these subjects pro-
duced similar results; thus, they were 
included in the study cohort. 
Women who were in menopause 
were excluded from participation. Meno-
pausal status was based on self-reported 
frequency of menstrual cycles. 
Participants recorded their dietary in-
take for 3 days. Nutrient content was de-
termined with the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Food Processor 
Nutrition Analysis and Fitness</rs> software 
package (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 8.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">ESHA Research</rs>, 
Salem, OR). </p>

<p>Blood and urine samples were col-
lected in the morning following an over-
night fast. Serum osteocalcin was 
measured via an immunoradiometric as-
say. Urine N-telopeptides were deter-
mined via a Vitros ECi competitive assay 
on a morning spot sample. 
Univariate analyses included Stu-
dent's t test, the 
2 test, and Pearson cor-
relations. Linear regression was used to 
assess potential independent associations 
for markers of bone turnover (i.e., depen-
dent variable). </p>

<p>RESULTS -Biomarkers of bone turn-
over stratified by sex are presented in Ta-
ble 1. Participants consumed, on average, 
slightly more Zn than the daily recom-
mended dietary allowance (RDA) (11 mg/ 
day for men and 8 mg/day for women). It 
should be noted, however, that approxi-
mately one-third of the individuals dem-
onstrated values less than the RDA. 
Osteocalcin levels were lower for individ-
uals with Zn intake levels below the RDA 
(15.9 Ϯ 5 [n ϭ 21] vs. 19.6 Ϯ 6 ng/ml 
[n ϭ 45]; P Ͻ 0.05). 
Zn intake correlated with osteocal-
cin in the group overall (r ϭ 0.48; P Ͻ 
0.001). When examined by sex, both Zn 
intake and osteocalcin levels were 
highly correlated for men (r ϭ 0.57; P Ͻ 
0.001), but the correlation did not 
reach statistical significance for women 
(r ϭ 0.34; P ϭ 0.09). No significant 
correlations were observed for N-
telopeptides and Zn. 
A direct-entry linear regression 
model, with osteocalcin as the depen-
dent variable, was performed. With du-
ration of diabetes, sex, A1C, insulin use 
per kilogram, total calorie intake, and 
Zn entered as potential independent 
variables, the overall model was signif-
icant (R 
2 ϭ 0.32; P Ͻ 0.01). Zn intake 
(P Ͻ 0.001), however, was the only in-
dependent correlate of osteocalcin, 
whereas sex was borderline statistically 
significant (P ϭ 0.061). A potential in-
teraction between sex and Zn intake was 
investigated and found not to be signif-
icant. In sex-specific models, control-
ling for the other variables, Zn intake 
(P Ͻ 0.01) was independently associ-
ated with osteocalcin for men (R 
2 ϭ 
0.34 and P Ͻ 0.05 for the model) but </p>

<p>not for women. We also examined the 
R 
2 for the model when Mg, phosphorus 
(P), or Ca was entered as a potential 
independent variable replacing Zn. No 
other micronutrient produced as strong 
an R 
2 for the regression model as that 
for Zn, and only P was independently 
associated with osteocalcin (P Ͻ 0.05). 
No independent association with Zn 
was found when N-telopeptides were 
used as the dependent variable. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -This study indi-
cates that Zn intake is associated with a 
marker of bone turnover. Although it 
has been shown that Zn stimulates os-
teoblasts and the Zinc Effects on Nutri-
ent/nutrient Interactions and Trends in 
Health and ageing (ZENITH) study (5) 
showed some, albeit inconsistent, evi-
dence of a relationship between Zn nu-
tritive status and bone turnover, to our 
knowledge this is the first study in type 
1 diabetes that shows an independent 
association for Zn intake and osteocal-
cin. Our results, however, suggest that 
this relationship may be stronger for 
men than for women. 
Zn plays several roles in bone me-
tabolism. Zn stimulates bone protein 
synthesis and bone formation in tissue 
cultures (2). The anabolic effect of IGF-I 
in osteoblasts is enhanced by Zn (6). Zn 
deficiency, however, impairs DNA syn-
thesis and protein metabolism, nega-
tively impacting bone formation (1). In 
type 1 diabetic individuals with poor 
glycemic control, Arreola et al. (4) 
showed a significant decrease in both 
bone mineral content and Zn, suggest-
ing that Zn deficiency may be a contrib-
utory factor to bone loss. Some have 
suggested that Zn deficiency leads to an 
increase in free radical production (7). </p>

<p>Oxidative stress has been shown to be 
an independent risk factor for osteopo-
rosis (8). 
Why Zn intake appears to be more 
strongly associated with osteocalcin for 
men than for women is not clear. It may 
be because the women in our study 
were not in menopause. Herzberg et al. 
(9) showed that urinary discharge of Zn 
is increased in postmenopausal women 
with osteoporosis. Thus, perhaps the 
role of Zn in bone metabolism plays a 
larger role for women once they have 
reached menopause. It should be noted 
that there was no significant association 
of age with markers of bone turnover for 
either sex. No association between Zn 
intake and N-telopeptides was noted. 
Only one morning urine sample was 
collected for N-telopeptides, which may 
explain the lack of association because 
of a large intra-individual variability for 
N-telopeptides. 
This study provides evidence of a 
relationship between Zn and a marker 
of bone turnover in type 1 diabetes. As 
for its limitations, the cross-sectional 
nature of the study indicates associa-
tions, and causality remains to be clari-
fied. In addition, for 9 of 25 subjects who 
were taking a multivitamin, the exact Zn 
content of their supplement could not be 
determined. A common multivitamin 
with an average Zn, Ca, Mg, and P content 
was assigned to these subjects. This as-
signment could have attenuated the asso-
ciations, potentially obscuring that 
between N-telopeptides and Zn intake. 
Multivariate analysis omitting these sub-
jects, however, produced similar results. 
Although the importance of higher 
levels of osteocalcin with regard to bone 
health is not clear, dietary factors are 
modifiable. Given that an inadequate in-</p>

<p>take of Zn has been reported as a risk fac-
tor for fractures in men (10), Zn may be 
important in reducing this risk in people 
with type 1 diabetes. </p>
