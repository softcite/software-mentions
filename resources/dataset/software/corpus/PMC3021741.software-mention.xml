<p>Purpose 
We investigated the clinicopathologic information of patients with gastric cancer with multiple 
primary cancers (GC-MPC) of three or more sites. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods 
Between 1995 and 2009, 105,908 patients were diagnosed with malignancy at Severance Hospital, 
Yonsei University Health System. Of these, 113 (0.1%) patients with MPC of three or more sites 
were registered, and 41 (36.3%) of these were GC-MPC. We retrospectively reviewed the 
clinical data and overall survival using the medical records of these 41 GC-MPC patients. We 
defined synchronous cancers as those occurring within 6 months of the first primary cancer, 
while metachronous cancers were defined as those occurring more than 6 months later. </p>

<p>Results 
Patients with metachronous GC-MPC were more likely to be female (p=0.003) and young than 
patients with synchronous GC-MPC (p=0.013). The most common cancer sites for metachronous 
GC-MPC patients were the colorectum, thyroid, lung, kidney and breast, while those for 
synchronous GC-MPC were the head and neck, esophagus, lung, and kidney. Metachronous 
GC-MPC demonstrated significantly better overall survival than synchronous GC-MPC, with 
median overall survival durations of 4.7 and 14.8 years, respectively, and 10-year overall 
survival rates of 48.2% and 80.7%, respectively (p＜0.001). </p>

<p>Conclusion 
Multiplicity of primary malignancies itself does not seem to indicate a poor prognosis. The early 
detection of additional primary malignancies will enable proper management with curative 
intent. </p>

<p>However, there are few reports of MPC for gastric cancer. This is 
because gastric cancer is less frequent in Western Europe and the 
U.S. than it is in East Asia. In addition, multiple primary cancers of 
three or more sites are extremely rare conditions in patients with 
gastric cancer. Therefore, there is little data which reports the inci-
dence and clinical features of this rare disease entity. 
Therefore, we performed this study to evaluate the incidence of 
gastric cancer patients with three or more primary cancers. In addition, 
we also investigated clinicopathologic information of metachronous 
and synchronous gastric cancer patients in order to improve patient 
management and follow-up. </p>

<p>1 Patients </p>

<p>Between January 1995 and December 2009, 105,908 patients 
were diagnosed with malignancy at Severance Hospital, Yonsei 
University Health System. Among these, 113 (0.1%) patients with 
MPC of three or more sites were registered, and 41 (36.3%) of these 
had synchronous or metachronous gastric cancer. Diagnosis of gastric 
cancer and other MPC were pathologically confirmed in all patients. </p>

<p>2 Methods </p>

<p>We retrospectively reviewed clinicopathologic features of these 
41 patients with metachronous or synchronous gastric cancer in MPC 
of three or more sites. The following data was collected; gender, age 
at initial cancer diagnosis, stage, gastric cancer histology, and survival 
from the time of first diagnosis of cancer. The tumor stage of the 
gastric cancer was determined according to Tumor-Node-Metastasis 
(TNM) classification (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 6th 
edition). Two main categories were used for histological typing: 
differentiated type (including papillary adenocarcinoma and well and 
moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) and undiffe-
rentiated type (including poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, 
mucinous adenocarcinoma, and signet ring cell adenocarcinoma). 
The MPC was defined according to Warren and Gates's criteria 
(11). The definition of MPC was as follows: 1) the tumor had to 
have definite features of malignancy, 2) the tumor had to be separate 
and distinct from the index tumor, which was gastric adenocarcinoma 
in this study, 3) the possibility of the tumor being a metastasis of the 
index tumor had to be ruled out. Based on this definition, we selected 
a total of 113 patients with three or more primary cancers between 
1995 and 2009. Then, we selected 41 patients who were diagnosed 
with primary gastric cancer, synchronously or metachronously. 
In terms of the chronicity, we defined synchronous and metach-
ronous cancer based on Moertel's definition. Synchronous cancers </p>

<p>were defined as those occurring within 6 months of the first primary 
cancer, while metachronous cancers were defined as those occurring 
more than 6 months later (12). Overall survival was defined as the 
time from first primary cancer diagnosis to death (of any cause). </p>

<p>3 Statistics </p>

<p>For statistical analysis, we used the χ 2 -test and Fisher's exact test 
for categorical variables and the student's t-test for continuous 
variables. The survival curve was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method and the statistical difference in prognosis was analyzed 
using a log rank test. <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">17.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL) was 
used throughout and p-values of ＜0.05 were considered significant. </p>

<p>R e s u l t s </p>

<p>1 Clinicopathologic features of synchronous and me-
tachronous MPC </p>

<p>A total of 41 gastric cancer patients were diagnosed with three or 
more primary sites (GC-MPC). Among these, 34 (82.9%) had triple, 6 
(14.6%) had quadruple and 1 (2.4%) had quintuple primary mali-
gnancies. Seventeen patients (41.5%) were diagnosed with MPC 
synchronously, whereas 24 (58.5%) were diagnosed metachronously. 
Among 17 patients with synchronous GC-MPC, 6 patients were 
diagnosed with other malignancies before gastric cancer. In addition, 
8 of 17 patients had 1 simultaneous malignancy in addition to 
gastric cancer, and 8 other patients had 2. Furthermore, one patient 
was diagnosed simultaneously with 3 other malignancies (esophagus, 
rectum, small bowel). Meanwhile, of 24 patients diagnosed with 
metachronous GC-MPC, 13 patients developed other malignancies 
after gastric cancer and 11 had other malignancies before gastric 
cancer. 
Clinicopathologic data for synchronous and metachronous GC-
MPC patients are described in Table 1. Twenty-nine (70.7%) patients 
were male, and the median age was 59 years (range, 27 to 79 years). 
The median time interval between the first cancer and the second 
cancer was 42 months (range, 11.5 to 225.2 months) and the time 
interval between the second and third cancer was 43 months (range, 
7.7 to 133.3 months). Of the 39 evaluable patients, the TNM stage 
of the gastric cancer was early stage (I or II) in 34 cases (82.9%) and 
advanced stage (III or IV) in 5 cases (12.2%). 
Regarding stage, histology, and time interval between each 
cancer, there were no differences between the synchronous and 
metachronous groups. Patients in the metachronous group had more 
female (p=0.003) and younger (p=0.013) patients than those in 
synchronous group. The incidence of early-stage and poorly-
differentiated tumor was slightly higher in gastric cancer patients </p>

<p>with metachronous GC-MPC than in those with synchronous GC-
MPC (91.7% vs. 70.6% for stage I/II and 54.2% vs. 23.5% for 
poorly differentiated histology, respectively). Excluding gastric </p>

<p>cancer, we also analyzed the stages of the other primary cancers. In 
the subset analysis, early stage cancers were slightly more frequent 
in the synchronous group (25% vs. 42.3%) without statistical 
significance (p=0.217). </p>

<p>2 Site distribution of MPC </p>

<p>For a total of 41 patients, the most common site of MPC other 
than gastric cancer was colorectal cancer (n=16, 39%), followed by 
cancers in the lung (n=10, 24.4%), head &amp; neck (n=10, 24.4%), and 
thyroid (n=9, 22%), as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1A. We also 
analyzed site distribution of MPC according to the chronicity. 
Among the 17 synchronous gastric cancer patients, other common 
primary sites were as follows (Fig. 1B): head &amp; neck (n=8, 47.1%), 
esophagus (n=6, 35.3%) and lung (n=4, 23.5%). In contrast, the most 
common sites for the 24 metachronous patients were: colorectum 
(n=14, 58.3%), thyroid (n=7, 29.2%) and lung (n=6, 25%). By way 
of comparison, esophageal cancer and head &amp; neck cancer were 
demonstrated more frequently in the synchronous group (35.3% vs. 
4.2%, p≤0.001 and 47.1% vs. 8.3%, p=0.008, respectively) while 
colorectal cancer was more frequent in the metachronous group 
(58.3% vs. 11.8%, p=0.003). 
We also analyzed the site distribution of MPC in terms of gender 
distribution. Among 41 GC-MPC patients, 29 (70.7%) patients were 
male and 12 (29.3%) were female. In males, the most common site 
for MPC was the head &amp; neck (n=10, 34.5%), followed by the colo-
rectum (n=9, 31%), lung (n=7, 24.1%), kidney (n=7, 24.1%), and 
esophagus (n=6, 20.7%) as shown in Fig. 2A. In females, the most 
common site was the colorectum (n=7, 58.3%), followed by the thyroid 
(n=4, 33.3%), breast (n=4, 33.3%), and endometrium (n=3, 25%). </p>

<p>When categorizing primary cancer sites based on smoking correlation, 
male patients demonstrated more frequent smoking related cancers 
such as head &amp; neck, lung, kidney, esophagus, bladder cancers than 
female patients (n=34, 53.1% vs. n=4, 15.4%, respectively, p=0.002). 
Fig. 2B and 2C compare the patients with synchronous primary 
cancer and those with metachronous primary cancer with regard to 
gender. In the metachronous group, the primary site distribution by 
gender was similar to that of the overall distribution (Fig. 2B). Con-
versely, in the synchronous group, the majority of patients were 
male and the primary site distribution by gender was different from 
the overall distribution (Fig. 2C). The most common sites in des-
cending frequency were: the head &amp; neck, esophagus, lung, liver, 
kidney, and colorectum. </p>

<p>3 Survival outcome and cause of death </p>

<p>With a median follow-up duration for the whole group (41 patients) 
of 5.6 years (range, 0.1 to 23.2 years), the median overall survival </p>

<p>duration and 10-year overall survival rate were 14.8 years (figure 
not shown) and 63.2%, respectively. The same figures for the 
synchronous and metachronous GC-MPC groups, respectively, 
were 4.7 years and 48.2%, and 14.8 years and 80.7% (p＜0.001) 
(Fig. 3). We analyzed overall survival by gender, stage distribution, 
and gastric cancer histology. The survival differences between the 
synchronous and metachronous GC-MPC groups were significant in 
male (p=0.002), stage I/II (p=0.011) and well differentiated 
histology (p=0.01) groups, while the difference in female (p=0.629), 
stage III/IV (p=0.502) and poorly differentiated histology (p=0.154) 
groups did not reach statistical significance (Table 3). 
At the time of the analysis, 13 patients had died of either gastric or 
other primary cancers. Of these 13 patients, 8 patients were meta-
chronous and 5 patients were synchronous. The causes of death are 
presented in Table 4. </p>

<p>D i s c u s s i o n </p>

<p>We described the clinicopathologic features of a rare disease 
entity, GC-MPC, and analyzed its clinical significances to establish 
follow-up plan in cancer patients. During the 15 year investigation 
period, 0.1% of cancer patients had a MPC with three or more 
primary sites, and 36.3% of these were gastric cancer patients. This 
incidence is consistent with previous studies which reported pre-
valences of 0.029 to 1.7% (7,13,14). 
Synchronous and metachronous gastric cancer patients showed 
somewhat different second cancer distribution. For metachronous 
gastric cancer patients, the most common cancer sites in descending 
order were: colorectum, thyroid, lung, kidney and breast. This finding 
is similar to the distribution of cancer in the general Korean population 
(15): stomach, colorectum, thyroid, breast, liver and lung in descending 
order of frequency. However, interestingly, the site distribution for </p>

<p>synchronous gastric cancer demonstrated a different order: head &amp; 
neck, esophagus, lung, and kidney. A possible reason for this pheno-
menon may be shared risk factors, especially cigarette smoking. 
Smoking is thought to be a risk factor for gastric cancer (16,17). The 
gender difference between synchronous and metachronous gastric 
cancer also supports this assumption. More male gastric cancer patients 
were diagnosed initially with multiple synchronous sites than female 
patients. In further subgroup analysis, smoking related cancers (head 
&amp; neck, lung, esophagus, kidney, bladder) were significantly more 
common in males than in female patients. This suggests that smoking 
plays an important role in the increased incidence of synchronous 
disease in male patients. More careful examination of these sites 
may therefore be needed at the time of diagnosis and during the follow-
up period of the gastric cancer. Further epidemiologic study is 
warranted to clarify this point. 
In addition, the metachronous gastric cancer group contained 
more female and younger cases. These findings seem to be caused 
by different peak ages between males and females. According to the 
Korean cancer registry (15), there are two peak incidences in females. 
Breast and thyroid cancers in females were most frequently diagnosed 
in the fourth and fifth decades, whereas other malignancies like 
gastric cancer were often found in the seventh decade. Conversely, most 
cancers in males were diagnosed in the seventh decade. Therefore, 
females were at greater risk of being diagnosed with a first primary 
cancer of breast or thyroid cancer at a younger age, and those who 
survived their first primary cancer were at greater risk of developing 
a metachronous second primary cancer thereafter. 
Although there is still little data for the underlying mechanism, 
three main explanations have been put forward for MPC. First, with 
longer survival, there is a greater likelihood of attack by many carci-
nogens, resulting in the development of more precancerous lesions. 
Additionally, assuming the risk of cancer is constant, it is more 
likely that precancerous lesions will develop into clinically significant 
cancers due to accumulation of genetic changes (6). This mechanism 
is explained by multistep carcinogenesis over time and the molecular 
and environmental changes of body associated with the aging process. 
Second, "field carcinogenesis" may be another mechanism for MPC </p>

<p>pathogenesis (12,18,19). This theory implies that if cells in a similar 
microenvironment or with similarly susceptible cell biology are 
exposed to the same dose of carcinogens for the same duration of 
time, they have a similar risk of developing into cancer (20). The 
association of upper aerodigestive tract cancer and lung cancer is a 
well studied example of the field carcinogenesis theory (21,22). Lastly, 
genetic vulnerability due to specific genetic mutations may be res-
ponsible. MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS1, and PMS2 mutations in 
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer have been known to 
increase the genetic susceptibility for uterus, ovary, and stomach 
cancer (23). 
The survival outcome in our study is consistent with previous 
studies (24,25), which suggests that metachronous patients have 
better prognoses than synchronous patients. In this study, the pro-
portion of early stage (I or II) gastric cancer was 82.9%. Although 
recent developments in diagnosis and the introduction of mass 
screening programs have allowed increased detection of early 
gastric cancer, the proportion of early gastric cancer in this study is 
much higher than in the general population of Korea (50%). As 
patients with histories of cancer tend to undergo regular medical 
check-ups, this could lead to earlier diagnoses of new malignancies 
at curable stages (6). For these reasons, multiplicity of primary 
malignancies does not always imply a poor prognosis. Furthermore, 
metachronous status may sometimes result in a better survival outcome 
due to the detection of second or third primary cancer at earlier stages. 
Also, the better survival in the metachronous GC-MPC was maintained 
even when we did not include the favorable prognostic cancers such 
as thyroid or prostate cancer (data not shown). </p>

<p>Although our study had some unique findings, there were two 
potential limitations. First, the retrospective single center nature of 
our study may limit the generalization of our results. However, our 
analysis is based on data from the registry of the Yonsei Cancer 
Center, a major, 2000-bed tertiary hospital in Korea. This well 
organized and standardized tumor registry has records for every case of 
carcinoma in situ or carcinoma in our hospital since 1980. Therefore, 
the data from our registry can be interpreted as being broadly repre-
sentative of Korea as a whole. Secondly, because of the long follow-
up duration, some information was insufficient, and altered diagnostic 
and treatment strategies may have influenced the results. Therefore, 
further validation with nationwide data is needed, and this information 
might be useful in the establishment of a national diagnostic/treatment 
strategy for gastric cancer patients. </p>

<p>We reported the clinical features of multiple primary cancer in 
gastric cancer patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study des-
cribing the clinical features and prognosis of three or more primary 
sites in gastric cancer. The early detection of additional primary 
malignancies will enable prompt management with curative intent. 
Therefore, based on our results, further genetic and epidemiologic 
studies are warranted to clarify understanding of the pathogenesis 
and improve therapeutic outcome. </p>
