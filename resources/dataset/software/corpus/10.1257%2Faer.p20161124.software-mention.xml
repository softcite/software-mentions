<p>Database; and a composite of earnings and 
placement information based on extracts from 
IRS W-2 forms, the Longitudinal Employer 
Household Dynamics microdata (LEHD), 
the Business Register (BR), Longitudinal 
Business Database (LBD), and the Integrated 
Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD) (Zolas 
et al. 2015). The UMETRICS file contains uni-
versity payroll records on the proportion of earn-
ings allocated to all federal awards (and some 
nonfederal awards) for all pay periods and for 
all individuals. The data also include the federal 
funding agency and job titles, which we mapped 
into six occupation categories that include fac-
ulty and graduate student. These data identify all 
people employed on research projects and their 
positions. The focal award is identified based on 
the time on the award and the award's share of 
the student's earnings. 
PhD recipients ("graduate students" includes 
Masters students) are identified by matching 
UMETRICS data to ProQuest's Dissertation and 
Thesis Database. These data contain the name of 
the dissertation's author, the subject (which we 
aggregated manually), institution awarding the 
degree, and the degree awarded. 
We link the UMETRICS data to the 2010 
census via a person identifier, used internally 
by the Census Bureau, called the Protected 
Identification Key (PIK). PIKs are assigned 
through the Person Identification Validation 
System (<rs type="software">PVS</rs>), which uses probability record 
linkage techniques and personal information 
such as name, date of birth, and residential loca-
tion (Wagner and Layne 2014). Once a PIK is 
assigned to a record, the Personally Identifiable 
Information is removed so analysts can anony-
mously link individuals across files for statisti-
cal and research purposes. Person records in the 
census contain date of birth, gender, race, eth-
nicity, and relationship to the head of household 
(HH), the last of which permits inference about 
certain relationships within a household. Marital 
status is modeled for graduate students who are 
either the HH or listed as a spouse or unmarried 
partner of the HH. Individuals are characterized 
as having children when they are, or are married 
to, the HH and there are (step) children of the 
HH present. </p>

<p>1 </p>

<p>1 This approach provides valuable information but has 
two main limitations. First, we can only infer marital status </p>

<p>The PIK is used to link to W-2 earnings, which 
cover total annual wages, tips, and other com-
pensation from the job with the highest earnings 
in each year from 2005 and 2012. Linking to 
the LEHD provides establishment identifiers, 
and linking on those establishment identifiers 
to the BR, LBD, and ILBD provides sector of 
employment. 
As shown in the online Appendix, the 
UMETRICS data include 3,551,730 payment 
records, representing 127,822 employees (at all 
levels) from four universities. Of these, 11,773 
earned a research doctorate from one of the four 
universities, and 3,837 were in the 2007-2010 
graduating cohort. We keep those in STEM 
fields, between the ages of 24 and 40, who were 
assigned a PIK and matched to earnings data. 
The final sample includes 1,237 students (867 
male and 370 female). There are no gender dif-
ferences in terms of demographics. For each, all 
but 1 percent are white alone (57 percent), black 
alone (2.3 percent), or Asian alone (40 percent); 
3 percent are Hispanic; the average age is just 
over 30; and just under two-thirds are married 
or partnered. Nineteen percent of females and 
24 percent of males had children at the time 
of the 2010 census. There are clear differences 
in field of study-59 percent of the females in 
our sample completed dissertations in biology, 
chemistry, or health, but only 27 percent of 
males wrote dissertations in those fields. Males 
were more than twice as likely to complete dis-
sertations in engineering (45 percent versus 
21 percent) and were 1.5 times as likely to study 
computer science, math, or physics (28 percent 
versus 19 percent). Given these differences, it is 
crucial to account for field of study when esti-
mating training and labor outcomes. </p>

<p>II. Analysis </p>

<p>We use OLS to compare the training environ-
ments and labor market outcomes of female and 
male doctoral recipients along a wide range of </p>

<p>or presence of children for those who are either listed as the 
HH or are married or partnered to the HH. Individuals in 
our sample who are in multi-family or multi-generational 
households may be incorrectly classified as single or child-
less. Second, the 2010 census provides a point-in-time mea-
sure of marital status and presence of children, while our 
UMETRICS and earnings data are longitudinal. Therefore, 
these measures become increasingly noisy as our educa-
tional and labor market outcomes deviate further from 2010. </p>

<p>dimensions. The main variable of interest is an 
indicator equal to one if the student is a woman. 
The simplest specification includes univer-
sity indicators, a linear trend for the first year 
the student appears as a graduate student in the 
UMETRICS data, 
2 and an indicator for being 
left-censored in the UMETRICS data. 
3 Labor 
market regressions also include indicators for 
graduation year. Additional controls are progres-
sively introduced for dissertation topic, funding 
agency, race, Hispanic origin, age and its square, 
marital status, and presence of children. Finally, 
interactions are included between gender and </p>

<p>2 Some students enter the UMETRICS data first as under-
graduates and later transition to graduate students. 
3 A student is defined as left-censored if the date she 
first appears as a graduate student in the UMETRICS data 
is equal to the first date for which her university's data are 
available. </p>

<p>both marital status and presence of children. Of 
course, there are likely to be unmeasured differ-
ences between women and men and those with 
and without children. 
Table 1 reports differences in training environ-
ments. Here and in Table 2, columns 1a through 
1c report raw means for women and men, and 
the difference between the two. The remaining 
columns report the gender gaps conditional on 
the controls discussed above. Dependent vari-
ables enter as rows. There is substantial gen-
der separation in teams. For the average female 
graduate student in the data, over two out of 
ten faculty members on the research teams are 
female, while fewer than one out of ten faculty 
members are female for the average male grad-
uate student. This finding is robust; even using 
the richest set of controls in column 6, there is 
a precise 5 percentage point difference in the 
proportion of faculty members on the research </p>

<p>team who are female. There is some evidence 
female graduate students work on teams with a 
higher percentage of other female students, but 
this result disappears controlling for dissertation 
topic. 
These differences could be due to choice 
("sorting"), external forces ("segregation"), or 
a combination of both. Furthermore, since stu-
dents are observed at a relatively late stage in 
their education, sorting by choice at this stage 
may derive from experiences (including segre-
gation) at earlier stages. Distinguishing between 
these mechanisms is beyond the scope of this 
paper and is an area for future research. 
The remainder of Table 1 shows gender dif-
ferences in several characteristics of STEM 
students' training environments. These differ-
ences may be advantageous or disadvantageous. 
For example, female graduate students tend to 
be on awards with smaller teams and a greater 
share of faculty per graduate student. This may 
imply more opportunities for direct mentorship, 
but it also may reflect differences in the size and 
prestige of grants (i.e., smaller awards may not </p>

<p>be able to employ as many graduate students). 
Female graduate students are employed on fewer 
federal research awards overall than their male 
counterparts, spend slightly less time partici-
pating in their primary award, and have shorter 
spans between first appearing in the UMETRICS 
data and graduating, although many of these dif-
ferences are sensitive to the specification. These 
differences could be interpreted two ways. In 
one view, the tendency of females to partici-
pate in fewer awards and appear in the data for 
shorter durations could reflect specialized train-
ing and faster degree completion. In another 
view, female students may be isolated from 
other researchers and may begin participating in 
federally funded research later. More research is 
needed to determine which view is correct. 
The early labor market outcomes of the males 
and females in the graduating cohort can also be 
studied. We examine outcomes one year from 
the time the student graduates (according to 
ProQuest) or leaves the payroll of the univer-
sity that granted the degree (according to the 
W-2 data), whichever is later. Specifically, we </p>

<p>Figure 1 shows unconditional kernel density 
plots of earnings for males and females in all 
sectors, the Academic and Government Sector, 
and all other sectors. Panel A shows women are 
more concentrated than men at the low-to-middle 
portion of the earnings distribution and less rep-
resented at the higher end of the earnings distri-
bution, with the male earnings distribution being 
bimodal. Panel B shows relatively smaller gaps 
among those going into academia and govern-
ment, with many earning typical postdoctoral 
researcher incomes just under $50,000. Women 
and men earn the most in industry, but the gap 
is also larger. 
Table 2 further analyzes differences in early 
labor market outcomes. Column 1 of the top row </p>

<p>4 Far more people are in academia than government, but 
these sectors have similar earnings. </p>

<p>shows that the female students in our graduating 
cohort are 13 percentage points less likely than 
male graduate students to work in the lucrative 
sectors outside academia and government. This 
holds controlling for university, degree year, 
and demographic characteristics, but column 4 
shows there are no detectable differences once 
we control for broad dissertation topic and fund-
ing source. We find unconditional wage differ-
ences between males and females of 0.37 log 
points (31 percent). Controlling for university 
characteristics, degree date, and demographics 
has little impact on the point estimate. However, 
we see the magnitude of the estimated wage gap 
drop by about two-thirds to 11 percent when 
we include controls for dissertation topic and 
funding source, underscoring the important role 
of field of study.

<p>and household structure (column 5) does not 
change the point estimate, which is significant 
at the 10 percent level. Allowing the impact of 
partnership status and children to vary by gen-
der, however, makes the point estimate of the 
male-female wage gap statistically indistin-
guishable from zero. This suggests the presence 
of children contributes meaningfully to the gen-
der wage gap. However the point estimates on 
the interactions themselves are imprecise, pos-
sibly due to noise in measurement of children 
and partnered status (see footnote 2). Finally, 
the gender gap is larger for industry employees 
and robust to controlling for sector. </p>

<p>III. Conclusion </p>

<p>This paper explores differences in STEM 
training environments and labor market place-
ment outcomes using unique transaction data 
from university combined with administrative 
and survey data from the Census Bureau. The 
results show gender separation in training, but 
no clear gender disadvantages in training envi-
ronments. There are, however, differences in 
placement outcomes-women are much less 
likely to enter industry and more likely to enter 
academia or government. Women have sub-
stantially lower wages, with a larger gap for 
those entering industry. This difference is due 
largely to field of study and disappears con-
trolling for gender interacted with marital sta-
tus and the presence of children. These results 
should be interpreted with caution. The data 
represent a limited number of schools and only 
some aspects of the training environment. Also, 
labor outcomes likely reflect some unobserved </p>

<p>topic was invariant to the stage at which we introduce it. 
Given its central role in our results, we also tried estimating 
regressions that interacted gender and topic. However, we 
found no evidence of within-topic gender gaps in wages. </p>

<p>heterogeneity, including in hours worked, and 
potentially household decisions on housework 
and child care. </p>
