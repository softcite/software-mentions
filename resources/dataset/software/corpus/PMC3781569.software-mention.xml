<p>OBJECTIVEdTo examine the associations of maternal gestational glucose tolerance with 
offspring body composition in late childhood. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdAmong 958 women in the prebirth cohort 
Project Viva, glucose tolerance was assessed in the second trimester by nonfasting 50-g 1-h 
glucose challenge test (GCT), followed if abnormal by fasting 100-g 3-h oral glucose tolerance 
test (OGTT). We categorized women as normoglycemic (83.3%) if GCT was #140 mg/dL, 
isolated hyperglycemia (9.1%) if GCT was abnormal but OGTT normal, intermediate glucose 
intolerance (IGI) (3.3%) if there was one abnormal value on OGTT, or gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDM) (4.5%) if there were two or more abnormal OGTT values. Using multivariable 
linear regression, we examined adjusted associations of glucose tolerance with offspring overall 
(N = 958) and central (N = 760) adiposity and body composition using dual X-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) measured at the school-age visit (95 6 10 months). </p>

<p>RESULTSdCompared with that in the male offspring of normoglycemic mothers, DXA fat 
mass was higher in male offspring of GDM mothers (1.89 kg [95% CI 0.33-3.45]) but not in male 
offspring of mothers with IGI (0.06 kg [21.45 to 1.57]). DXA trunk-to-peripheral fat mass, a 
measure of central adiposity, was also somewhat higher in male offspring of GDM mothers (0.04 
[20.01 to 0.09]). In girls, DXA fat mass was higher in offspring of mothers with IGI (2.23 kg 
[0.12-4.34]) but not GDM (21.25 kg [23.13 to 0.63]). We showed no association of gestational 
glucose tolerance with DXA lean mass. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdIn this study, only male offspring of GDM mothers manifested increased 
adiposity, whereas only female offspring of mothers with IGI did so. Sex differences in glycemic 
sensitivity may explain these findings. </p>

<p>the associations of GDM with offspring 
adiposity in childhood (14,15). 
Our aim was to fill these research gaps 
by examining associations of maternal 
gestational glucose tolerance with several 
measures of childhood adiposity at the 
school-age visit, before and after adjust-
ment for maternal prepregnancy BMI, 
and according to sex of the child. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODSdProject Viva is an ongo-
ing prospective prebirth cohort study in 
which we recruited pregnant women at 
their initial prenatal visit from Harvard 
Vanguard Medical Associates, a multispe-
cialty group practice in eastern Massa-
chusetts, between April 1999 and July 
2002. All mothers gave informed consent, 
and institutional review boards of partici-
pating institutions approved the study. 
All procedures were in accordance with 
the ethics standards established by the 
Declaration of Helsinki (16). 
Of the 2,128 mothers with a live birth 
in Project Viva, excluded were those with 
missing or incomplete records on glucose 
tolerance testing (n = 47), those with a 
history of previous type 1 (n = 9) or type 
2 (n = 7) diabetes and polycystic ovarian 
syndrome with glucose intolerance (n = 
2), and 29 pregnancies with gestation 
,34 weeks. We followed the children 
with in-person visits just after delivery 
and at 6 months, 3 years, and 7 years of 
age and with annual mailed question-
naires at other ages. Of the 1,709 eligible 
for the school-age visit, 1,116 agreed to 
participate in an in-person visit. Anthro-
pometry could be measured in 1,070, but 
not all participants accepted to undergo 
DXA. Our final sample included 958 chil-
dren with data on maternal glucose toler-
ance during pregnancy, anthropometry 
measured at the school-age visit, and rel-
evant covariates. A subsample of 760 of 
these 958 children had body composition 
measures with DXA. 
Compared with the mothers who 
were not included in this analysis (n = 
1,170), included mothers (n = 958) were 
more likely to be older (32.3 vs. 31.4 
years at enrollment), white (69.7 vs. 
62.5%), college graduates (70.0 vs. 
60.1%), and nonsmokers (90.3 vs. 84.3%) 
and have household income .$70,000/ 
year (74.6 vs. 65.3%). However, they did 
not differ substantially in terms of mean 
maternal prepregnancy BMI (24.9 vs. 25.2 
kg/m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>), gestational weight gain (15.4 vs. 
15.6 kg) or gestational glucose tolerance 
status (normoglycemic: 83.1 vs. 82.2%). </p>

<p>Father's BMI was similar in the included 
and excluded groups (26.4 kg/m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>). Chil-
dren included in the analysis had slightly 
higher birth weight for gestational age z 
score than those who were not included 
(0.21 vs. 0.14). </p>

<p>Measures 
Exposures: gestational glucose tolerance. 
Obstetric clinicians routinely screened 
all women for GDM at 26-28 weeks 
of gestation with a nonfasting oral glu-
cose challenge test (GCT), in which ve-
nous blood was sampled 1 h after a 
50-g oral glucose load. If the blood glu-
cose exceeded 140 mg/dL, the clinician 
referred the woman for a fasting 3-h 
100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). 
Abnormal OGTT results were a blood glu-
cose .95 mg/dL at baseline, .180 mg/dL 
at 1 h, .155 mg/dL at 2 h, or .140 mg/dL 
at 3 h (17). We categorized women with 
two or more abnormal values on the 
OGTT as having GDM; those with one 
abnormal value on the OGTT as having 
an intermediate glucose intolerance (IGI) 
previously called impaired glucose toler-
ance (7); those with an abnormal GCT 
but a normal OGTT as having isolated 
hyperglycemia (IH); and the remaining 
women as having normal glucose toler-
ance. Those who were diagnosed with 
GDM were typically followed by a nutri-
tionist, instructed to check their fasting 
blood glucose daily, and treated with 
diet and in some cases insulin (7). Moth-
ers with IGI or IH did not have any fur-
ther screening and were managed in the 
same way as women with normal GCT 
results. 
Outcomes: child overall adiposity, fat, 
and lean mass. During the in-person 
school-age visit, trained research assis-
tants measured children's weights (TBF-
300A; Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL) and 
heights (calibrated stadiometer; Shorr 
Productions, Olney, MD). We calculated 
age-and sex-specific BMI percentiles and 
z scores using U.S. national reference data 
(18). The research staff measured sub-
scapular (SS) and triceps (TR) skinfold 
thicknesses using Holtain calipers (Holtain, 
Crosswell, U.K.) and calculated the sum 
(SS+TR) and the ratio (SS/TR) of skin-
folds. BMI z score and SS+TR represent 
overall adiposity, whereas SS/TR is a mea-
sure of central or truncal adiposity (19). 
To measure waist circumference, we used 
the method used in the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) (20). For each measurement, 
the measuring tape was positioned </p>

<p>parallel to the floor with the participant 
standingdabdomen relaxed, arms at the 
sides, and feet togetherdand facing the 
observer with the waist exposed (21). 
We measured waist circumference just 
above the right iliac crest at the mid-
axillary line to the nearest 0.1 cm 
using a Hoechstmass measuring tape 
(Hoechstmass Balzer, Sulzbach, Ger-
many). Research assistants followed stan-
dardized techniques and participated in 
biannual in-service training to ensure 
measurement validity (IJ Shorr; Shorr 
Productions) (22). Inter-and intrarater 
errors for skinfold measurements were 
within published reference ranges for all 
measurements (23). 
Trained research assistants adminis-
tered whole-body DXA scans with Holo-
gic model Discovery A (Hologic, Bedford, 
MA) that they checked for quality control 
on visit days. We used <rs id="software-0" type="software">Hologic</rs> software 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 12.6</rs> for scan analysis. A single 
trained research assistant checked all 
scans for positioning, movement, and 
artifacts and defined body regions for 
analysis. Intrarater reliability was high 
(r = 0.99). We calculated the DXA fat 
mass and fat-free mass indexes using the 
following formula: [total DXA fat mass (or 
fat free mass) in kg]/(height in meters) </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>(24). We also calculated the DXA trunk 
to peripheral fat mass ratio, a measure of 
central adiposity (25,26). 
Covariates. During pregnancy and in late 
childhood, using a combination of ques-
tionnaires and interviews, we obtained 
information about maternal age, race/ 
ethnicity, education, parity, smoking dur-
ing pregnancy, marital status, and house-
hold income. We collected information 
from prenatal medical records on serial 
pregnancy weights and blood pressure 
readings and infant birth weight and de-
livery date. Mothers reported their pre-
pregnancy weight and height and the 
paternal weight and height. We calculated 
gestational weight gain as the difference 
between prepregnancy weight and the last 
clinically recorded weight before delivery. 
We derived gestational age from the last 
menstrual period or from the second 
trimester ultrasound if the two estimates 
differed by .10 days. Based on U.S. na-
tional natality data, we determined sex-
specific birth weight for gestational age z 
scores (27). 
At the school-age visit, mothers 
reporteddseparately for weekdays and 
weekend daysdthe number of hours 
per day that the children participated in 
light, moderate, and vigorous physical </p>

ers also reported the frequency of child-

<p>Statistical analysis 
We report age-, race/ethnicity, and sex-
adjusted means for child body com-
position and behaviors reported at the 
school-age visit. Using multivariable lin-
ear regression, we built models based on 
bivariate associations and on our expec-
tation of which variables would inde-
pendently predict the outcomes as 
demonstrated by prior studies (8,9,28,29). 
Our basic model was adjusted for child 
age at examination (model 1) and subse-
quently adjusted for maternal prepreg-
nancy BMI (model 2), gestational weight 
gain and paternal BMI (model 3), and ma-
ternal race/ethnicity, age, education, and 
parity and smoking during pregnancy, 
marital status, and household income 
(model 4: final model). When the out-
come was a measurement of central adi-
posity, we additionally adjusted for child 
BMI because we were interested in fat dis-
tribution after controlling for overall body 
size. We further adjusted for birth weight 
for gestational age z score to assess 
whether it might be in the pathway linking 
gestational glucose tolerance with child 
adiposity (model 5). 
Within the multivariable modeling 
context, we tested the interaction of ges-
tational glucose tolerance and child sex 
on child body composition. Because we 
found evidence of an interaction of ma-
ternal gestational glucose tolerance with 
child sex on overall adiposity measured by 
DXA total fat mass, DXA fat mass index, 
and SS+TR (all P for interaction #0.04) 
and with BMI, albeit less so (P for interac-
tion = 0.14), we present all the adiposity 
results separately according to child sex. 
We did not detect an interaction of gesta-
tional glucose tolerance and child sex on 
DXA fat-free mass (P for interaction = 
0.85) or fat-free mass index (P for interac-
tion = 0.48), so we present sex-adjusted 
results for fat-free mass with boys and girls 
combined (Supplementary Table 1). We 
performed all the analyses using SAS ver-
sion 9.3 (Cary, NC). </p>

<p>RESULTSdOur sample included 43 
(4.5%) mothers with GDM, 32 (3.3%) 
with IGI, 87 (9.1%) with IH, and 796 
(83.1%) with normal glucose tolerance in 
mid-pregnancy (Table 1). Compared with 
normoglycemic mothers, those with an </p>

<p>abnormal gestational glucose tolerance 
(GDM, IGI, or IH) were older and had 
higher prepregnancy BMI and lower preg-
nancy weight gain (Table 1). Mothers 
with GDM or IGI were more frequently 
black or Hispanic and more frequently 
smokers during pregnancy. Offspring of 
mothers with GDM, IGI, or IH all tended 
to have a higher birth weight and birth 
weight for gestational age z score and a 
lower gestational age compared with the 
offspring of normoglycemic mothers 
(Table 1). 
At the school-age visit, mean (SD) 
age was 95 (10) months and mean BMI 
was 17.1 (2.8) kg/m 
2 in boys and 17.2 (3) 
kg/m 
2 in girls (P = 0.56). DXA fat mass 
and percentage fat mass were 6.6 (3.5) kg 
and 22.2% (5.7), respectively, in boys and 
8.0 (3.7) kg and 26.8% (5.8) in girls (P , 
0.0001). DXA trunk-to-peripheral fat 
mass ratio was lower in boys than in girls 
(0.57 [0.10] vs. 0.59 [0.10], P = 0.04) In 
boys and girls combined, mean weight or 
BMI, adjusted for age at examination, sex, 
and maternal race/ethnicity, did not 
greatly differ across the categories of ges-
tational glucose tolerance (Table 1). How-
ever, offspring of mothers with IGI or 
GDM had a higher overall adiposity as 
measured by SS+TR and DXA (DXA per-
cent fat mass: norm, 24.3%; IGI, 26.3%; 
and GDM, 26.4%). They also had a larger 
waist circumference (norm, 59.8 cm; IGI, 
61.4 cm; and GDM, 61.9 cm) and more 
trunk fat (norm, 2.5 kg; IGI, 2.9 kg; and 
GDM, 3.2 kg). Other indicators of overall 
and central adiposity showed similar 
trends. Offspring of normoglycemic, 
IGI, and GDM mothers had similar fat-
free mass. Child physical activity and in-
take of sugar-sweetened beverages and 
fried food did not materially differ accord-
ing to maternal gestational glucose toler-
ance status (Table 1). 
Table 2 presents the associations of 
gestational glucose tolerance with overall 
and central adiposity measured by DXA, 
according to child sex. Among boys, un-
adjusted analyses (model 1) showed that 
offspring of GDM mothers had a higher 
total fat mass (2.57 kg [95% CI 0.95-4.2]) 
and trunk-to-peripheral fat mass ratio 
(0.05 [0.003-0.09]) than offspring of 
normoglycemic mothers. Among girls, 
compared with offspring of normoglyce-
mic mothers, fat mass was higher in fe-
male offspring of IGI mothers (2.57 kg 
[0.22-4.91]) but not among offspring of 
GDM mothers (20.31 kg [22.35 to 
1.72]). In contrast to the boys, trunk-to-
peripheral fat mass ratio in girls was not </p>

<p>different for IGI or GDM (IGI 0.01 kg 
[20.05 to 0.07] and GDM 0.00 kg 
[20.05 to 0.05]; both vs. normoglyce-
mic), although there was a suggestion of 
higher DXA trunk-to-peripheral fat mass 
ratio in offspring of IH mothers (0.03 
[0.00-0.06]). 
Additional adjustment for maternal 
prepregnancy BMI (Table 2 [model 2]) 
and other covariates (models 3 and 4) 
partially attenuated the associations of 
GDM (in boys) and IGI (in girls) with total 
fat mass (1.89 kg [95% CI 0.33-3.45] for 
GDM in boys and 2.23 [0.12-4.34] for 
IGI in girls) and, in boys, with trunk-to-
peripheral fat mass ratio (0.04 [20.01 to 
0.09]) (Fig. 1). 
Table 3 presents the adjusted esti-
mates (model 4) of the association of ges-
tational glucose tolerance with other 
measures of overall and central adiposity. 
Consistent with the results shown in 
Table 2 for the DXA trunk-to-peripheral 
fat mass ratio, SS/TR was higher in male 
offspring of GDM mothers (b = 0.34 
kg/m 
2 [95% CI 0.04-0.63]) (Table 3). 
However, we did not detect similar in-
creases with waist circumference or DXA 
trunk fat mass adjusted for child BMI. In 
fact, it was the offspring of IGI, not GDM, 
mothers who showed a greater waist cir-
cumference (1.38 [0.20-2.56]). 
Associations of gestational glucose 
tolerance with other measures of overall 
adiposity (SS+TR, DXA fat mass index, 
and BMI z score) were similar to those 
described for DXA total fat mass, al-
though we did not detect an association 
of gestational glucose tolerance with BMI 
z score in boys (Table 3). 
To assess potential mediation, we 
additionally adjusted the final model 
(Table 2 [model 4]) for birth weight for 
gestational age z score (model 5) and 
found no attenuation of the associa-
tion of GDM with fat mass in boys 
(1.85 vs. 1.89 kg) or the association of 
IGI with fat mass in girls (2.24 vs. 2.23 kg) 
(Table 3). 
For DXA fat-free mass, the other 
categories of gestational glucose toler-
ance did not significantly differ from 
offspring of normoglycemic mothers 
(model 1, IH 0.09 kg [95% CI 20.22 
to 0.40], IGI 0.86 kg [20.50 to 2.23], 
and GDM 1.0 kg [20.31 to 2.31]). Re-
sults were similarly null for fat-free mass 
index (Supplementary Table 1). </p>

study of pregnant women and their chil-
dren, male offspring of mothers who had </p>

<p>GDM, but not IGI, exhibited higher over-

<p>Although chance is one plausible

the relatively small number of children in

another potential explanation relies on </p>

<p>the observation that male and female

<p>dimensions than female fetuses (31) as 
early as the preimplantation stage (32), 
but they seem to invest less in placental 
growth. Male placentas are smaller than 
those of female fetuses at any given birth 
weight (30). Male placentas are also more 
efficient; at any placental weight, male fe-
tuses tend to be heavier. This can result 
in less reserve capacity in the male fetus 
in the presence of a stressful event (33). In 
case of shortage of key nutrients, male fe-
tuses attempt to compensate, more or less 
successfully, by expanding their placental 
surface in late gestation (30). In utero, 
boys seem more responsive to the moth-
er's current diet and metabolism than 
girls, who appear more influenced by 
their mother's lifetime nutrition and me-
tabolism (30,34). As a consequence, male 
fetuses may be more vulnerable to varia-
tions in nutrient intake or transfer during 
pregnancy. In contrast, female fetuses </p>

<p>seem to take a more cautious route that 
favors survival. They grow more slowly in 
weight and length and they have a larger 
placenta for a given birth weight than 
boys (30). Female neonates also have 
higher insulin concentrations at birth 
and higher adiposity for a given birth 
weight, indicating that they allocate 
more resources toward fat mass than do 
male fetuses (35). 
These characteristics may result in 
differential sensitivity to hyperglycemia in 
pregnancy and in differential long-term 
programming in male and female fetuses. 
Ricart et al. (36) showed at birth in 
.9,000 newborns that GDM was a pre-
dictor of macrosomia only in males. In 84 
newborns born to GDM mothers, mater-
nal fasting blood glucose was the major 
predictor of adiposity measured by air 
displacement plethysmography in male 
newborns but had little effect on adiposity </p>

<p>in females. Conversely, maternal BMI was 
the primary predictor in female newborns 
but not in males (37). A recent report 
from a large randomized controlled 
trial of treatment for mild GDM by the 
U.S. Maternal-Fetal Medicine Network 
reported a greater reduction of birth 
weight and fat mass in male than in female 
neonates (38). Studies also reported sex-
specific associations with measures of ad-
iposity in childhood. A study of .600 
French children born to GDM mothers 
paired with children born to non-GDM 
mothers (i.e., normoglycemic, IH, and 
IGI combined) showed that only the 
male offspring of GDM mothers had a 
higher BMI at 5-7 years after adjustment 
for prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight 
gain, caloric intake, physical activity, 
screen time, and a range of sociodemo-
graphic variables (14). In contrast to our 
findings, Krishnaveni et al. (15) showed </p>

<p>Gestational glucose tolerance and child adiposity </p>

<p>that female offspring of Indian mothers 
with GDM had higher adiposity at age 5 
and 9.5 years than offspring of mothers 
without GDM. They did not find an in-
creased adiposity in male offspring of 
GDM mothers, although they noted 
some signs of metabolic dysfunction at 
age 9.5 years. These dissimilar findings 
could be explained by genetic, cultural, 
or environmental differences in the two 
populations. In particular, body com-
position differs in Indian and white 
populations (39). </p>

<p>Our results also suggest that the off-
spring of IGI and IH women in this study 
are noticeably different from the offspring 
of normoglycemic mothers. Unfortu-
nately, many earlier studies did not sep-
arately examine offspring of IGI mothers, 
but this group has recently received en-
hanced attention after results of the Hy-
perglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy 
Outcomes (HAPO) study that showed a 
continuous association of maternal glyce-
mia during pregnancy with offspring 
adiposity at birth (2). In a sample of </p>

<p>.9,000 mother-child pairs, Hillier et al. 
(40) showed that offspring of IGI moth-
ers, but not IH, had a higher risk of child-
hood overweight than offspring of 
normoglycemic mothers, but they did 
not mention any sex-specific associations. 
The female-only associations that we 
show in offspring of IGI mothers have 
never been reported before. While we 
did not have data on degree of control 
or adherence to treatment in women 
with GDM in this study, a possible expla-
nation for the observed difference is that </p>

<p>exposure of the fetuses to excess glycemia 
may differ in intensity and timing among 
those whose mothers have IGI versus 
GDM. In addition, sensitivity may also 
differ in males and females, which may 
result in differential long-term program-
ming. However, our results should be 
tempered by the fact that if we could 
have used the recent criteria recommen-
ded by the International Association of 
the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups, 
a large proportion of the women diagnosed 
with IGI in our study would have been 
diagnosed with GDM (41). 
We did not find an effect of gesta-
tional glucose tolerance on fat-free mass 
in boys or girls. 
Similarly, Catalano et al. (42) did not 
show a significant difference in lean mass 
measured by DXA in 9-year olds between 
the offspring of GDM (mean [SD] 25.0 
[6.7] kg) and of normoglycemic mothers 
(24.5 [4.9] kg, P = 0.72). Chandler-Laney 
et al. (8) showed a positive, albeit modest, 
correlation of maternal glucose measured 
during pregnancy with children's lean 
mass at 5-10 years of age after adjustment 
for height and sex (r = 0.37, P = 0.07). 
It will be important to reevaluate these 
associations during and after puberty, 
since muscle mass acquisition takes 
place largely at puberty in a sex-specific 
manner. 
Previous studies have suggested that 
the association of exposure to the hyper-
glycemic environment with later child 
obesity is only in part explained by its 
influence on birth weight (3,7,8,29). Our 
finding that adjustment for birth size did 
not markedly attenuate associations with 
increased childhood adiposity confirms 
these reports. 
Strengths of this study include pro-
spectively collected longitudinal data be-
ginning in early pregnancy; detailed 
assessment of demographic, socioeco-
nomic, and biological family and child 
characteristics; and research standard 
measurements of child body composi-
tion. We assessed overall and central 
adiposity using DXA as well as other 
anthropometric measures. 
One limitation of this study is the lack 
of information on glycemic control in the 
GDM group. The sample size also pre-
vented us from assessing whether women 
being categorized as IGI because of an 
abnormal fasting glucose value or an 
abnormal 1-h, 2-h, or 3-h postglucose 
value modifies the association with child 
adiposity. Indeed, it has been shown that 
the metabolic implications of impaired </p>

<p>glucose tolerance in pregnancy vary in 
relation to the timing of the abnormal 
glucose value from the diagnostic OGTT 
(43). Another limitation is attrition. It is 
possible that loss to follow-up could have 
introduced bias, but many baseline varia-
bles were similar in the study sample and 
in those excluded. Generalizability may 
be limited given the relatively higher 
socioeconomic status of the study 
participants. 
In conclusion, maternal hyperglyce-
mia in pregnancy was associated with 
excess adiposity but not greater lean body 
mass in offspring. In girls, IGI but not 
GDM was associated with greater off-
spring adiposity, whereas in boys we 
found the opposite. A different sensitivity 
of male and female fetuses in utero may 
result in differential programming and 
metabolic consequences in the long run. </p>
