<p>This study was conducted to examine the reliability, validity and clinical utility of the 
Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) for a Korean population. 69 dementia patients with 
Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stages 2 or 3 were participated in this study. The 
SIB, Korean version-Mini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), CDR, and Seoul-
Activities of Daily Living (S-ADL) were administered. The validity of the SIB was 
confirmed by evaluating the correlation coefficients between the SIB and K-MMSE, 
CDR, S-ADL, which were found to be significant. Cronbach's alpha for the total SIB 
score and each subscale score showed high significance, and the item-total corre-
lation for each subscale was also acceptable. The test-retest correlation for the total 
SIB score and subscale scores were significant, except for the praxis and orienting 
to name. The total SIB score and subscale scores were examined according to 
CDR. The results suggest that the SIB can differentiate the poor performances of 
severely impaired dementia patients. On the basis of the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC), it can be concluded that the SIB is able to accurately discriminate 
between CDR 2 and 3 patients. The results of this study suggest that the SIB is a 
reliable and valid instrument for evaluating severe dementia patients in Korean pop-
ulation. </p>

<p>Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) in Korean Dementia Patients </p>



<p>Profile (SCIP) (5), the Preliminary Neuropsychological Bat-
tery (BNP) (6), the Test for Severe Impairment (TSI) (7), and 
the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) (8). 
The SIB is a particularly reliable, valid and useful instru-
ment for evaluating cognitive changes in dementia patients 
whose level of functioning is in the moderate to severe range 
(1). The SIB was also more apt to identify differences in the 
performances in the 5-10 score region of the Mini Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) (9), thus avoiding the floor effect 
(10). The information provided by the SIB appeared to be 
fairly independent of that obtained from the CDR and GDS 
in the moderate to severe stages, although the utility of the 
SIB in milder dementia was limited (1). 
At present, the number of instruments that can be used 
in this country to evaluate patients with severe dementia 
who cannot complete conventional neuropsychological tests 
is very limited. Recently, Kim et al. developed the Severe 
Dementia Rating Scale (SDS) (11), which has a similar form 
to the Korean version-Mini Mental State Examination (K-
MMSE) (12). The SDS is composed 30 items that are inde-
pendent of the education of the patients, and allows the var-
ious cognitive domains to be assessed within a shorter peri-
od of time. However, it has two main limitations, namely 
that it provides limited comprehensive information about 
the patient's cognitive functions and that the test-retest reli-
ability interval is very short. 
This study was conducted to examine the reliability and 
validity of the SIB for a Korean population with the purpose 
of making a more comprehensive and appropriate instrument 
available for the evaluation of dementia patients with severe 
impairment. Also, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve was used to determine the degree to which the SIB 
discriminates dementia severity and to examine its clinical 
utility. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Subjects </p>

<p>This study included 69 (male=19, female=50) patients 
with the diagnosis of dementia according to DSM-IV (13) 
and NINCDS/ADRDA (14) criteria treated at a Geropsy-
chiatry Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, Samsung Medical 
Center. 54 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), 7 had the mixed 
type of dementia and 8 had other types of dementia, e.g., 
vascular dementia, dementia due to Parkinson's disease, 
dementia not otherwise specified. Only patients with CDR 
stages 2 or 3 and scores of less than 15 on the K-MMSE were 
included in this study. 25 subjects were rated as CDR stage 
2, and 44 as stage 3. The mean K-MMSE total score was 
5.49 (SD=3.91). The mean age of the subjects was 74.4 yr 
(SD=10.0), and their mean length of education was 7.91 yr 
(SD=5.78). </p>

<p>Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) </p>

<p>Saxton et al. developed the SIB to assess patients with severe 
dementia who cannot complete conventional neuropsycho-
logical tests. The SIB contains 51 questions which take a 
total of about 20 min to administer, and the possible scores 
range from 0 to 100. The SIB is divided into 9 subscales, viz. 
social interaction skills (score 0-6), memory (score 0-14), 
orientation (score 0-6), language (score 0-46), attention (score 
0-6), praxis (score 0-8), visuospatial ability (score 0-8), con-
struction (score 0-4) and orienting to name (score 0-2), each 
of which yields individual scores. There is no cut-off score for 
normal subjects as the test is only intended to be used with 
patients known to be severely impaired. However, it is possi-
ble to grade the severity of impairment by rating those who 
score less than 63 on the SIB (corresponding approximately 
to less than 4 on the MMSE). Also, in terms of its adminis-
tration, the SIB is composed of very simple one-step com-
mands, which are presented together with gesture cues and 
can be repeated several times to facilitate comprehension. 
The SIB used in this study was translated into Korean by 
three clinical psychologists, who made sure that all the char-
acteristics and structure of the original SIB were maintained 
in the Korean version. Two items in the language subscale 
were modified. First, we changed the item 'recite the months 
of the year' to 'recite the days of the week', because the orig-
inal item was too easy for Koreans. Second, the phrase 'people 
spend money' was not natural when it was translated into 
Korean, thus we changed it to 'I bought something'. 
In terms of its administration, the original materials (pho-
tograph of spoon and cup, blocks) of the SIB were familiar 
to the patients. However, the patients mistook the color of 
certain blocks. For example, as sometimes occurs in normal 
elderly, those patients with severe cognitive impairment or 
a low educational level sometimes mistook a 'blue' block for 
a 'green' one. Thus, when they failed to indicate the correct 
color for the blue block, we informed them of their mistake 
before passing on to the next item. All of the items of the 
SIB are presented in the appendix. </p>

<p>Korean version-Mini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) </p>

<p>The MMSE was developed to evaluate the subject's orien-
tation, memory, attention &amp; calculation, and visuospatial and 
language abilities. Kang et al. conducted a study to examine 
the validity of newly constructed K-MMSE. It contains 30 
questions, and the possible scores range from 0 to 30. </p>

<p>Seoul-Activities of Daily Living (S-ADL) </p>

<p>The S-ADL (15) was developed to assess basic activities of 
daily living, including self-care/hygiene, toileting, ambula-
tion, and so on. It is composed of 12 items, and the possible 
scores range from 0 to 24. Using the S-ADL, the clinician eval-</p>



<p>I.-S. Ahn, J.H. Kim, H.M. Ku, et al. </p>

<p>uates the subject's functional disability by conducting inter-
views with the caregivers. </p>

<p>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) </p>

<p>The CDR assesses the cognitive performance in six catego-
ries; memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, 
community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The 
information needed to evaluate each category is obtained by 
semi-structured interviews with both the patient and a reliable 
informant. The CDR provides descriptors for each category 
and a global CDR score of five levels of impairment (0=no 
dementia, 0.5=questionable, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). </p>

<p>Data analysis </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were performed with <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">11.0</rs> for 
<rs type="software">WINDOWS</rs>. The Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman 
correlation were used to test for significant differences in 
the total SIB, K-MMSE and S-ADL scores according to sex, 
age and education. The validity of the SIB was determined 
by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients between 
the SIB and the K-MMSE, CDR, and S-ADL. Cronbach's 
coefficient alpha and item-total correlation coefficients were 
generated to examine the internal consistency of the SIB. 
Also, Spearman correlation coefficients were generated to eval-
uate the 3 months test-retest reliability. The Mann-Whitney 
U test was used to assess the differences in the mean SIB total 
score for the various CDR stages. Finally, a ROC curve was 
used to compare the sensitivity, specificity and probability </p>

<p>of correctly discriminating dementia severity in the case of 
the SIB, K-MMSE and S-ADL. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Demographical characteristics </p>

<p>Sex and education had no significant effect on the K-MMSE, 
SIB, S-ADL or CDR, but significant correlations were found 
between age and the total K-MMSE score ( (69)=0.26, p&lt;0.05) 
and age and the total SIB score ( (69)=0.27, p&lt;0.05). </p>

<p>Validity </p>

<p>The construct validity of the SIB was examined by com-
paring the total SIB score with the total K-MMSE, CDR 
and S-ADL scores (Table 1). The Spearman correlation coef-
ficient between the SIB and the K-MMSE was 0.875 (p&lt; 
0.01); between the SIB and the CDR was -0.678 (p&lt;0.01); 
and between the SIB and the S-ADL was -0.661 (p&lt;0.01). </p>

<p>Reliability </p>

<p>The Cronbach's coefficient alpha and item-total correlation 
coefficients were generated to examine the internal consis-
tency of the SIB (Table 2). The internal consistency of the 
total SIB score was 0.97, and that of the SIB subscales ranged 
from 0.57 (orientation) to 0.94 (language). The item-total 
correlation for the SIB subscales was also acceptable (p&lt;0.01). 
Data from those 15 subjects who were tested again after 
an interval of 3 months allowed the assessment of the test-
retest reliability using Spearman correlation coefficients (Table 
3). The test-retest correlation for the total SIB score was sta-
tistically significant. Significant subscale correlations were 
observed for social interaction, memory, orientation, language, 
attention, visuospatial ability and construction. However, 
the test-retest correlation for the praxis and the orienting to 
name subscales did not reach significance. </p>

<p>SIB score according to dementia severity </p>

<p>The subjects were separated into two groups according to 
their dementia severity using the CDR with the aim of mea-
suring the total SIB score and subscale scores (Table 4). As a 
result, the difference in the total SIB score and its subscale 
scores between the CDR 2 and CDR 3 groups was significant, 
except for the orienting to name subscale. Despite their per-
vasive deficits, the more severely demented patients belong-
ing to the CDR 3 group showed a wide range of total SIB 
score and subscale scores. 
In the analysis of impairment in the individual cognitive 
domains, the CDR 2 patients had greater impairment in 
the individual cognitive domains, especially in memory and </p>

<p>orientation, as compared with that in the full score of each 
subscale. On the other hand, their construction, attention 
and social interaction abilities were comparatively maintained. 
The CDR 3 patients had more severe impairment than the 
CDR 2 patients in all cognitive domains, and this greater 
impairment was especially notable for construction, atten-
tion and praxis. </p>

<p>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve </p>

<p>The ROC curve was used to determine the degree to which 
the SIB allows the dementia severity to be discriminated 
(CDR 2 vs. CDR 3). The sensitivity and specificity levels of 
the SIB were also compared with those of the K-MMSE and 
S-ADL (Table 5). The sensitivity and specificity of the SIB 
in the differentiation of the CDR 2 and CDR 3 patients were 
both 88% when the cut-off score was 62.5. When the cut-
off score of the K-MMSE was 5.5, the corresponding sensi-
tivity and specificity were 86% and 88%, respectively. The 
sensitivity and specificity of the S-ADL were 84% and 82%, 
respectively, when the cut-off score was 6.5. Grossly, the sen-
sitivity and specificity of the SIB were higher than those of 
both the K-MMSE and S-ADL. 
The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each test revealed 
that the SIB (AUC=90.6%) was more accurate than both 
the K-MMSE (AUC=90%) and S-ADL (AUC=88.1%) in 
the differentiation of the CDR 2 and CDR 3 patients. The 
diagnostic accuracy of the K-MMSE was similar to that of 
the SIB. However, as a result of the diagnostic accuracy of 
the K-MMSE subscales, it was found that only the place ori-
entation, registration, language and visuospatial subscales 
could be usefully discriminated between the CDR 2 and 
CDR 3 patients using this instrument (Table 6). The diag-
nostic accuracy of the S-ADL was lower than that of both 
the SIB and K-MMSE. Fig. 1 shows the results in the form 
of the ROC curve. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>In this study, the reliability and validity of the SIB were 
examined, and its clinical utility for discriminating demen-
tia severity was proved using the ROC curve. The results of 
this study suggest that the SIB is a reliable, valid, and use-
ful instrument for evaluating severely impaired dementia 
patients. 
The significant correlation that was obtained between the 
SIB and the K-MMSE, CDR and ADL suggests that the SIB 
has appropriate construct validity, as was previously observed. 
In particular, the high correlation between the total SIB and 
K-MMSE scores indicates that the SIB evaluates global cog-
nitive functioning in patients with severe dementia. Cron-
bach's coefficient alpha for the total SIB score and each sub-
scale score and the item-total correlation for the SIB subscales 
showed high significance, indicating that the SIB has excel-
lent internal consistency. The test-retest correlation for the 
total SIB score and each subscale scores was relatively signif-
icant. This result suggests that the performance on this instru-
ment has acceptable stability over time. However, the test-
retest correlation for the praxis subscale was not significant 
in this study, whereas the one month test-retest correlation 
for this subscale was 0.63 (p&lt;0.01) in a previous study (1). 
This discrepancy may be attributed to the change in the func-
tioning of the patients caused by the long retest interval. The 
test-retest correlation for the orienting to name subscale was 
not significant either, possibly due to the fact that the differ-
ence in the orienting to name subscale score was not notable, 
because almost all of the patients were successful in this sub-
scale. 
The total SIB score and the SIB subscale scores were com-
pared according to the dementia severity using the CDR. It 
was found that the difference in the total SIB score and its 
subscale scores between the CDR 2 and CDR 3 patients was 
significant, except for the orienting to name subscale. Despite 
their pervasive deficits, the more severely demented patients 
belonging to CDR 3 showed a wide variation in both the 
total SIB scores and the scores on each subscale. These results 
suggest that the SIB is useful for evaluating dementia patients 
with a moderate to severe range of functioning, and can diffe-
rentiate between the poor performances of very severely im-
paired dementia patients. The SIB can also avoid the floor 
effect that was frequently observed in conventional neuropsy-
chological tests used for evaluating patients in the advanced 
stages. In the analysis of the impairment in individual cog-
nitive domains according to dementia severity, the CDR 2 
patients had greater impairment in memory and orientation 
than other cognitive domains. On the other hand, the con-
struction, attention and social interaction abilities were com-
paratively maintained. The CDR 3 patients showed more 
severe impairment than the CDR 2 patients in all cognitive 
functions. In particular, greater impairment was observed in 
the construction, attention and praxis subscales. However, </p>

<p>the difference in the orienting to name subscale score between 
the CDR 2 and CDR 3 patients was not significant. This 
result indicates that recognition of self is relatively maintained 
until the advanced stages of dementia. These aspects of the 
comparative decline in various cognitive domains are consis-
tent with the clinical course of AD, so the result of this study 
should provide us with a better understanding of natural his-
tory in AD. However, there is a limitation in that this study 
included not only AD patients but also patients with other 
forms of dementia. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the 
different aspects of cognitive impairment by dementia subtype 
in a further study. 
On the basis of the ROC curve, it can be concluded that 
the SIB was very useful for discriminating between CDR 2 
and CDR 3 patients, as was the total K-MMSE score. How-
ever, the time orientation, attention/calculation and recall 
subscale scores were at floor and consequently, these subscales 
were not apt to discriminate dementia severity in the mod-
erate to severe stages of dementia. The S-ADL had a some-
what lower sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy 
than those of the SIB and K-MMSE. These results indicate 
that the SIB has greater clinical utility than the K-MMSE 
and S-ADL, because it can provide comprehensive informa-
tion about the changes in various types of cognitive function-
ing (i.e. social functioning, memory, language, and so on) of 
the patients and can discriminate between the relative impair-
ment in the cognitive domains in the final stages of the disease. 
This study has several limitations. First, the dementia sub-
type was not taken into consideration. Because those cogni-
tive functions that are more impaired or spared may differ 
according to dementia subtype, it is important that the differ-
ent aspects of cognitive impairment be examined by demen-
tia subtype in a further study. Second, there is a possibility 
that the change in the functioning of the patients caused by 
the long retest interval may have affected the test-retest cor-
relation coefficient. </p>
