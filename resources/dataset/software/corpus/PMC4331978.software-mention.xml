<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Objectives: This study was performed to analyze the 
toxicity of the test substance, anti-inflammatory phar-
macopuncture (AIP), when used as a single intramuscu-
lar-dose in 6-week-old, male and female Sprague-Daw-
ley rats and to find the lethal dose. </p>

<p>Methods: The experiment was conducted at Biotoxtech 
according to Good Laboratory Practices. Twenty (20) fe-
male and 20 male Spague-Dawley rats were divided into 
4 groups of five 5 female and 5 male animals per group. 
The rats in the three experimental groups received sin-
gle intramuscular injections with 0.1-㎖, 0.5-㎖ and 1.0-
㎖/animal doses of AIP, Groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively, 
and the control group, Group 1, received a single intra-
muscular injection with a 1.0-㎖ dose of normal saline. 
Clinical signs were observed and body weight measure-
ments were carried out for 14 days following the injec-
tions. At the end of the observation period, hematology, 
clinical chemistry, histopathological tests and necropsy 
were performed on the injected parts. </p>

<p>Results: No deaths occurred in any of the groups. Also, </p>

<p>histopathological tests showed that AIP had no effect 
on the injected parts in terms of clinical signs, body 
weight, hematology, clinical chemistry, and necropsy. </p>

<p>Conclusions: As a result of single intramuscular-dose 
tests of the test substance AIP in 4 groups of rats, the 
lethal dose for both males and females exceeded 1.0 
㎖/animal. Therefore, AIP is a relatively safe pharma-
copuncture that can be used for treatment, but further 
studies should be performed. </p>

<p>Pharmacopuncture is a new form of acupuncture 
treatment combining acupuncture and herbal medi-
cine. With acupuncture being based on the meridian 
theory and herbal medicine being based on Qi and fla-
vor theory, Pharmacopuncture utilizes both meridian 
and Qi/flavor theories. Pharmacopuncture is a unique 
treatment of traditional Korean medicine using nee-
dling and herbal medicine based on Qi-flavor theories 
and acupoint selection based on meridian theories [1]. 
In addition, eight-principle pharmacopuncture (EPP) 
is a method of treating disorders by using the founding 
principles in Korean medicine of Yin/Yang, internal/ 
external, cold/heat, and deficiency/excess [1]. 
Anti-inflammatory pharmacopuncture (AIP), which 
is a heat-clearing and detoxifying drug, is composed </p>

<p>of Lonicerae Flos, Forsythiae Fructus, Taraxaci Herba, Re-
hmanniae Radix, Scutellariae Radix, Coptidis Rhizoma, 
Phellodendri Cortex and Gardeniae Fructus [2]. AIP has 
been widely applied to musculoskeletal diseases in Kore-
an medical clinics, and excellent effects on pain relief have 
been announced recently [3-5]. Shin et al. [2], Lee and 
Yoon [3], Kim and Hong [4], Song et al. [5], Yoo et al. [6], 
Kim and Oh [7], and Yoon and Yoo [8] have reported case 
studies in which AIP was used to treat various diseases as-
sociated with pain. However, studies on the toxicity of AIP 
are lacking. Therefore, this study was performed to ana-
lyze the toxicity of AIP under single intramuscular-dose in 
6-week-old SD rats and to verify the stability of AIP. </p>

<p>2. Materials and Methods </p>

<p>2.1. Materials </p>

<p>Anti-inflammatory pharmacopuncture is composed of 
Lonicerae Flos, Forsythiae Fructus, Taraxaci Herba, Re-
hmanniae Radix, Scutellariae Radix, Coptidis Rhizoma, 
Phellodendri Cortex and Gardeniae Fructus (Table 1) [2]. 
A distillation method was used for extracting EPP. Herbs 
were washed and sliced for easier extraction. The herbs 
were then placed in the bottom of a flask that was then 
filled with tertiary distilled water, soaked and boiled. The 
liquid was collected from the upper part of the distillation 
apparatus. The pH and the concentration of the extract 
were measured, followed by filtration, subdivision and 
sterilization [1]. The pharmacopuncture was made in a 
sterile laboratory by using steam distillation in a labora-
tory at the Korean Pharmacopuncture Institute (KPI) ac-
cording to the following procedure: Cleansing → Leaching 
→ Extracting → Distilling → Cooling → pH, NaCl control → 
Filtering → Sterilizing → Packing [9]. The pharmacopunc-</p>

<p>ture was stored in a refrigerator (2-8℃). 
The HPLC (High performance liquid chromatography) 
Agilent Technologies 1260 infinity equipment was used for 
the analysis, and the analysis conditions were a column of 
Capcell Pak C18 (type: UG80 5 ㎛, size: 4.6 ㎜ I.D. x 250 
㎜, Shiseido), a 1-㎖/min flow, a column temperature of 
35℃, a sample dose of 50 ㎕, and UV 275 ㎚. For the mo-
bile phase condition, solvent A, H2O (5-mM NH4OAc), and 
solvent B, CAN (5-mM NH4OAc), were used to perform the 
analysis under gradient conditions in which mobile phase 
A was changed from 97% to 10% in 40 min. The result of 
HPLC analysis on AIP under these conditions is shown as 
a chromatogram in Fig. 1. In that chromatogram, the peak 
of the 9.0-min section was highest compared to the other 
peaks, and the ratio of the peak area of the 9.0-min section 
to the total area was found to be 60%. AIP is expected to 
contain an aromatic substance, and a qualitative analy-
sis study is deemed necessary to determine the unknown 
components associated with the peaks detected. 
Twenty-four (24) male and 24 female rats were purchased </p>

<p>from ORIENTBIO INC. The 24 male and the 24 female rats 
were 5 weeks old with body weights of 121.8~143.4 kg, 
and 103.8~120.9 kg, respectively. The laboratory condi-
tions were as follows: temperature: 21.0-23.1℃, relative 
humidity: 45.7%-61.5%, 10-15 ventilations/h, lighting 
cycle of 12 h/day and illuminance of 150-300 Lux. The 
rats were supplied with food (Teklad Certified Irradiated 
Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet 2918C) and clean water 
(tap water of Cheongju filtered with a water sterilizer and 
irradiated with ultraviolet rays). After 7 days of acclimati-
zation, the weights of the male rats were 183.0-205.6 g, and 
those of the female rats were 141.9-160.0 g. The 6-week-old 
Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped by using the criteria of 
their weights being close to the mean weight. A total of 20 
male rats and 20 female rats were distributed into 4 groups 
with 5 mice of each sex per group. The remaining animals 
were excluded from the test. </p>

<p>2.2. Methods </p>

<p>No deaths were observed as a result of single intramus-
cular-dose in the male or the female rats during prelimi-
nary test (Biotoxtech Study No.: B12868P). Based on those 
results, 1.0 ㎖/animal was selected as the high-dose, and 
0.5 and 0.1 ㎖/animal as the mid-dose and the low-dose, 
respectively. Normal saline solution, 1.0 ml/animal, was 
used for the control group (Table 2). 
Injection was performed using a disposable syringe (1 ㎖, </p>

<p>26G). In G2, 0.1 ㎖ of AIP was injected through IM at one 
point on the left thigh muscle. In G3, 0.5 ㎖ of AIP was in-
jected through IM as in G2. In G4 and G1, injection was 
done in the left and the right thigh muscles at 0.5 ㎖/site. 
An intramuscular dose was selected because AIP should 
be clinically applied to muscles. This study was conduct-
ed under the approval of the Institutional Animal Ethics 
Committee. </p>

<p>2.3. Statistics </p>

<p>Body weights, hematology, and clinical chemistry test re-
sults were tested using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.2</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc.</rs>., 
U.S.A). The Bartlett test was performed for homoscedastic-
ity (significance level: 0.05). In the case of homoscedastici-
ty, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed 
to yield significance (significance level: 0.05), and multiple 
testing of Dunnett's t-test was carried out (significance 
level: 0.05 on both sides and 0.01). For heteroscedasticity, 
significance (significance level: 0.05) was checked by us-
ing the Kruskal-Wallis test, and multiple testing with the 
Steel test was carried out (significance level: 0.05 on both 
sides and 0.01). </p>

<p>dition, on the day of injection (Day 0), clinical symptoms 
(type of toxicity symptom, time of expression, time of re-
covery, etc.) and fatality were observed at 30 min, 1, 2, 
4 and 6 h after injection. From Day 1 to Day 14, general 
symptoms were observed once a day. As a result of obser-
vations until Day 14 after injection of AIP, no abnormalities 
were found in any of the experimental rats (Table 4). </p>

<p>Body weight was measured on the day of injection (be-
fore injection) and on Days 3, 7 and 14. All groups showed 
continued increase in body weight after selection of the 
experimental groups. No significant differences existed 
among the experimental groups with the exception of a 
significant difference between female rats in G1 and G3 14 
days after dosing. However, it was an adventitious change 
with no dose dependance. No hanges caused by the test 
substance were recognized (Table 5). 
All rats had been fasting more than 18 h before necropsy. 
Blood was collected from the abdominal aorta on Day 15 
after applying anesthesia with isoflurane. The hematology 
test was done by using a blood corpuscle analyzer (ADVIA 
120, SIEMENS, Germany) after placing about 1 ㎖ of the 
collected blood in a tube containing EDTA(Ethylenedi-
aminetetraacetic acid). Erythrocyte count (RBC), hemo-
globin (HBG), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular vol-
ume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet 
(PLT), leucocyte count (WBC), WBC differential count 
(neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, baso-
phils) and Reti (reticulocytes) were measured. For the co-
agulation test, about 2 ㎖ of the collected blood was placed 
in a tube containing 3.2% sodium citrate and was centri-
fuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm before collecting the blood </p>

<p>plasma. Measurement was done using a coagulation time 
analyzer (Coapresta 2000, SEKISUI, Japan). Prothrom-
bin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
(APTT) were measured. The hematology test showed no 
significant differences between the normal saline group 
and any of the AIP groups (Table 6). 
For the clinical chemistry test, the unused blood remain-
ing after the hematology test was centrifuged for 10 min 
at 3,000 rpm before blood serum was collected. A clinical 
chemistry analyzer (7180, HITACHI, Japan) and electro-
lyte analyzer (AVL9181, Roche, Germany) were used to 
measure alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate ami-
notransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gam-
ma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), creatinine (Crea), total bilirubin (T-Bili), total 
protein (TP), albumin (Alb), A/G ratio, total cholester-
ol (T-chol), triglycerides (TG), phosphorus (P), glucose 
(Glu), calcium (Ca), chloride (Cl), sodium (Na) and potas-
sium (K). The clinical chemistry test showed no changes 
caused by the test substance in animals of either sex in any 
group, except that the total mean protein of G2 females 
and mean creatinine of G3 females showed statistically 
significant changes with P &lt; 0.05; however, the result had 
no toxicological meaning because it was not dose-de-
pendent (Table 7). 
Visual inspection after necropsy showed no visual ab-
normalities in the male and the female animals in any ex-
perimental group (Table 8). In addition, histopathological </p>

<p>tests on the injected parts showed no effect due to the test 
substance (Table 9). </p>

<p>4. Discussion </p>

<p>Eight-principle pharmacopuncture is effective when or-
gan symptoms are accurately diagnosed and treated with 
proper herbal medicine. This pharmacopuncture system 
does not create tolerance, toxicity, or addiction [1]. The 
amount of pharmacopuncture injection is divided into the 
amount for each acupoint and the total amount for the en-
tire treatment. The standard amount is 0.1 ㎖ for each acu-
point. The amount that is injected is increased gradually: 
0.1 ㎖ on each acupoint on the first day, 0.2 ㎖ on the sec-
ond day, and 0.3 ㎖ to 0.5 ㎖ on the third day. When 0.5 ㎖ 
has been injected without any side effects and the symp-
toms had improved, the dosage is no longer increased. 
However, if the symptoms persist, pharmacopuncture may 
be injected up to 1.0 ㎖ under careful supervision for pos-
sible side effects. If the improvement is weak, then the dos-
age can be increased to 1.5 ㎖. After that, increases can be 
made in increments of 0.5 ㎖, depending on the response. 
The total amount of injection should be between 3.0 ㎖ 
and 5.0 ㎖. Even if the patient does not show significant 
improvement, increasing the amount beyond 5.0 ㎖ must 
be carefully considered [1]. 
Side effects are possible when more than an adequate </p>

<p>amount is injected, when the medicine and the nature of 
the disorder are not in harmony and when contaminated/ 
denatured pharmacopuncture extract is injected. If side 
effects occur, body ache and pain around the acupoint 
maybe observed [1]. 
In this study, an intramuscular-dose toxicity test of AIP 
was performed by Biotoxtech to evaluate the stability of 
AIP, which had been manufactured by the KPI according 
to GLP. The result of single intramuscular-doses of AIP in 
the 4 groups of rats showed that the approximate lethal 
dose for both male and female rats exceeded 1.0 ㎖ There-
fore, AIP is a relatively safe pharmacopuncture that can 
be used for treatment, but further studies should be per-
formed in the future. </p>

<p>5. Conclusion </p>

<p>Conventionally EPP has been confined to using pharma-
copuncture doses of less than 1.0 ml, which is the reason 
in this study for choosing 1.0-1.5 ml as the level of AIP dos-
ing corresponding to the lethal dose. As none of the test 
subjects were affected by injections of up to 1.0 ml of AIP, 
it can be assumed that levels over 1.0 ml may have a de-
terminant effect. However, if the exact lethal dose is to be 
established, further studies are needed. Finally, the results 
clearly show that AIP dosing up to 1.0 ml is safe. </p>
