<p>It has been reported that the particulate matter under 10 m (PM10) has deleterious 
effects on respiratory health. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence 
of PM10 upon normal children's lung function. The subjects were 368 middle school 
students in two areas of Incheon Metropolitan City. One (Incheon) is in the central 
city and the other (Ganghwa) is in the suburbs. Air pollution data in the vicinities of 
two participating schools were obtained from monthly report of air quality from 
Korean Ministry of Environment in 2000. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) was 
done two times, the first one in March and the second one in December with the 
same students. We analyzed the relationship between the PM10 levels and pul-
monary functions (FEV1, FVC) of the children. The monthly average of the PM10 
level between the two areas showed no significant difference (55.3 vs. 52.3 g/m </p>

<p>3 </p>

<p>). 
In both regions, the difference of the PM10 level between March and December 
was statistically significant (64 vs. 56 g/m 
3 in Incheon, 64 vs. 54 g/m 
3 in Gangh-
wa). The findings of the PFT values in March were significantly lower than those 
values found in December for both regions. In conclusion, we suggest that PM10 has 
some adverse effect on the pulmonary function of normal children. </p>

<p>244 (male; 125, female; 119) from Ganghwa (Table 1). The 
student subjects were excluded if they had respiratory symp-
toms within one week before the test and if they had a his-
tory of chronic respiratory disease including bronchial asthma 
and if their growth measurements (height and weight) were 
over the 97th percentile or below the 3th percentile of 
Korean standard for their ages. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Pulmonary function testing was done using a portable elec-
tric mini-spirometer, in which forced expiratory volume per 
second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured. 
Prior to pulmonary function testing, a detailed explanation 
was given to the subjects by the trained examiners. After the 
test was performed five times, the minimum and maximum 
values were discarded and the three remaining values were 
averaged. In March and December of 2000, pulmonary func-
tion testing was done repeatedly with the same students. We 
selected March as the month when the yellow dust storms 
mainly occurred to evaluate the effects of PM10 on the lung 
function of healthy children. In addition, we also wanted to 
evaluate the effects of PM10 generated mainly from automo-
biles, so we chose December, when the effects of both the yel-
low dust storms and ozone were minimal. 
PM10 data in the vicinity of two participating schools 
were obtained from the monthly reports of air quality from 
Korean Ministry of Environment in 2000 (23, 24). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis </p>

<p>Statistical analysis were done using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> 
� version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">6.12</rs> for 
Windows, in which t-tests and the general linear model were 
used for univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. A 
probability value of less than 0.05 was considered to be sta-
tistically significant. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Baseline level of PM10 and other air pollutants </p>

<p>According to the data from the Korean Ministry of Envi-
ronment in 2000 (23, 24), the mean values of monthly lev-
els of PM10 were 52.3 g/m 
3 in Incheon and 55.8 g/m 
3 in 
Ganghwa, and there was no significant difference between 
the two areas. In March, the mean values of PM10 were the 
same as 64 g/m 3 in both areas. In December, the mean con-
centrations of PM10 were 56 g/m 
3 and 53 g/m 
3 in Incheon 
and in Ganghwa, respectively, and no statistical significance 
was noted between the two areas. In both regions, however, </p>

<p>the levels of PM10 were higher in March than in December 
(Table 2). The mean levels of NO2 and SO2 were higher in 
Incheon than in Ganghwa, but the mean levels of O3 were 
higher in Ganghwa than in Incheon (Fig. 1, Table 3). </p>

<p>In both regions, the higher academic year was, the greater 
the FEV1 and FVC values were. Moreover, the FEV1 and FVC 
values were greater in male students than in female students 
during the same academic year. The FEV1 and FVC value were 
greater in December than in March for the same academic 
year in both areas (Table 4, 5). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>The prevalence of asthma has increased worldwide and this 
has been most strikingly observed in the industrialized coun-
tries during the last decade. Epidemiologic studies suggest 
that environmental factors including air pollution play an im-
portant role for the increasing prevalence of asthma. The major 
air pollutants are CO, NOX, O3, SO2 and particulate matters. 
Among these pollutants, PM10 can have easily access to the 
lung via the respiratory tract, and this matter can deposit 
within the lung (25). According to the study in Utah, U.S.A., 
during the winter when the level of PM10 was high, the num-
ber of patients with respiratory diseases was three times high-
er than that measured during the winter, when the level of 
PM10 was low since the steel factory workers went on a strike 
(26). Moreover, several investigators reported that not only 
have the number of patients at outpatient department or an 
emergency room increased, but also the hospitalized or expired 
patients increased on the days when atmospheric dust was 
prevalent (8, 9, 27). In Korea, the highest daily level of total </p>

<p>suspended particles (TSP) was reported to be correlated with 
the number of hospitalization for asthma among the patients 
who were over 40 yr of age (15). 
We thought that the levels of PM10 were higher in Incheon 
than in Ganghwa because the density of traffic is more seri-
ous in Incheon. Contrary to our expectations, the levels of 
PM10 were not statistically different between the two areas, 
although the levels of NO2 and SO2 were higher in Incheon 
than in Ganghwa. The pulmonary functions of the students 
in two areas were not different either. Yet in both areas, the 
levels of PM10 were higher in March than in December. 
The levels of PM10 often exceeded a 24-hr mean level of 
150 m/m 3 for Korean environment air quality standards in 
March. These findings would be due to the yellow dust storms 
which refers to the wind-blown dust generated from northern 
China and Mongolia during the spring season. In Korea, yel-
low dust storms are usually observed in March and May every 
year, when the level of PM10 exceeds the level of environmen-
tal standard by two or three times (28). The size of particu-
late matter from the yellow dust is mainly 3 m (29). This 
range of particulate matter is easily respirable. So it is expect-
ed that this kind of particulate matter would have deleteri-
ous effects on respiratory system of normal children. Yellow 
dust storms occurred 4 times during March 2000 in Incheon 
and Ganghwa (30). 
The present study showed that the values of FEV1 and FVC 
were greater in December than in March for both male and 
female students at all academic years. Even when taking into 
consideration the increase of the children's height and weight 
during the nine months period, the results of pulmonary func-
tion test in December were higher than those for the grades 
one year older, who were checked in March, for almost all 
grades. Because only the level of PM10 was significantly high-
er for March than for December in both areas, we suggest that 
the decrements of pulmonary function in March for both areas </p>

<p>are associated with the increased level of PM10 and yellow dust. 
This particulate matter may have some important role for 
decrement of pulmonary function. 
There are several limitations in this study including the 
lack of personal exposure data, the possibility of other air pol-
lutant's effects, and lack of exact data of air pollutants on the 
day when the pulmonary function testing was performed. 
The levels of NO2 and SO2 were two times higher in Incheon 
than in Ganghwa and the levels O3 were higher in Ganghwa 
than in Incheon both for March and for December (Table 3). 
However, the levels of SO2 and O3 were similar in both May 
and December in each areas. The levels of NO2 were higher 
for December than for March in both areas. Therefore, we 
believe that the decrements of the value of pulmonary func-
tion in March were caused by particulate matter. 
In conclusion, we can suggest that PM10, especially the par-
ticulate matter generated from yellow dust storms may have 
significant negative effects on the FVC and FEV1 values in 
normal children. </p>
