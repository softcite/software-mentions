<p>Abstract: In the present study, we aimed to verify associations </p>

<p>between ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and pediatric obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) in a hospital-based population. 
This was a cross-sectional observational study on children aged 4 to 
16 years with OSA-related symptoms from a tertiary referral medical 
center. All children received overnight polysomnography and 24-hour 
recording of ABP. Severity of the disease was classified as primary 
snoring (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI &lt;1), mild OSA (AHI 1-5), and 
moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI &gt;5). 
For 195 children enrolled in this study (mean age, 7.8 AE 3.4 years; 
69% boy), ABP increased as severity of OSA increased. During day-
time, children with moderate-to-severe OSA had significantly higher 
systolic blood pressure (BP) (117.0 AE 12.7 vs 110.5 AE 9.3 mmHg), mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) (85.6 AE 8.1 vs 81.6 AE 6.8 mmHg), and diastolic 
BP load (12.0 AE 9.6 vs 8.4 AE 10.9 mmHg) compared with children with 
primary snoring. During nighttime, children with moderate-to-severe 
OSA had significantly higher systolic BP (108.6 AE 15.0 vs 
100.0 AE 9.4 mmHg), MAP (75.9 AE 9.6 vs 71.1 AE 7.0 mmHg), systolic 
BP load (44.0 AE 32.6 vs 26.8 AE 24.5 mmHg), systolic BP index 
(0.5 AE 13.1 vs À6.8 AE 8.5 mmHg), and higher prevalence of systolic </p>

<p>hypertension (47.6% vs 14.7 %) compared with children with primary 
snoring. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed an independent 
association between AHI and nighttime systolic BP and MAP after 
adjusting for adiposity variables. 
This large hospital-based study showed that children with moderate-
to-severe OSA had a higher ABP compared with children who were 
primary snorers. As elevated BP in childhood predicts future cardio-
vascular risks, children with severe OSA should be treated properly to 
prevent further adverse cardiovascular outcomes. </p>

<p>S </p>

<p>leep-disordered breathing includes a spectrum of upper 
airway disorders ranging from primary snoring to obstruc-
tive sleep apnea (OSA). 
1,2 In adults, untreated OSA is associ-
ated with hypertension </p>

<p>3,4 </p>

<p>and other cardiovascular 
morbidities. 
5,6 In children, Guilleminault et al 
7 first described 
high blood pressure (BP) with OSA in 1976. Since then, several 
studies have linked OSA with BP in a pediatric population. </p>

<p>7-12 </p>

<p>Although some studies have reported a trend of elevated BP in 
children with OSA, 
7-12 a recent meta-analysis by Zintzaras 
et al 
13 reported that evidence of an association between mod-
erate-to-severe childhood OSA and hypertension is insufficient. 
As the literature show inconsistent results regarding associ-
ations between BP and pediatric OSA, further studies are 
needed to clarify this clinical relevant issue. 
Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is a standard 
diagnostic tool for BP measurements because of high reliability 
and reproducibility. Monitoring ABP provides an estimate of 
mean BP level, the diurnal rhythm of BP, and BP variability. 
Several studies have shown that ABP monitoring, when com-
pared with clinic casual BP measurements, is superior in 
predicting target organ damage, morbid events, or cardiovas-
cular risk. 
14 However, few studies have used ABP monitoring to 
elucidate associations between BP and OSA in children. </p>

<p>8-12 </p>

<p>Furthermore, obesity increases risk of pediatric OSA. </p>

<p>2,15 </p>

<p>Obesity in children can also cause hypertension, which ulti-
mately increases cardiovascular risks. 
16,17 Previous studies 
have used a small sample size and have not considered the 
independent role of childhood OSA on BP. </p>

<p>8-12,18 </p>

<p>The aims of this study were to compare ABP level in 
children with OSA of varying severity (ie, primary snoring, 
mild, moderate-to-severe OSA) and to investigate the associ-
ation between childhood OSA and BP parameters. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Study Population </p>

<p>Children aged 4 to 16 years with symptoms suggestive of 
OSA, including snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, or 
breathing pauses reported by parents who were referred to 
the National Taiwan University Hospital, were recruited from 
the respiratory (P-LL), pediatric (W-CC), and otolaryngologic 
clinics (W-CH) between September 2012 and March 2015. </p>

<p>19 </p>

<p>Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Commit-
tee of National Taiwan University Hospital, and written 
informed consent was obtained from each participant or their 
parents. Basic data, clinical history, and physical examination 
data were obtained by the corresponding author. 
The weight and height of each child were measured. Age-
and sex-corrected body mass index (BMI) was applied using 
established guidelines to convert BMI into BMI percentile. </p>

<p>20 </p>

<p>Obesity was defined as age-and sex-corrected BMI &gt;95th 
percentile. 
2,20 Exclusion criteria included the following: chil-
dren with craniofacial abnormalies, genetic disorders, or neu-
romuscular diseases; children who had previously received 
tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy; significant medical illnesses 
such as respiratory or cardiac disease. </p>

<p>Polysomnography </p>

<p>Overnight polysomnography (PSG) study (Embla 
N7000, Reykjavik, Iceland) was performed in the sleep center 
of the National Taiwan University Hospital. 
2,15,18,19,21 -26 The 
sleep parameters were scored according to the 2007 American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine standards. 
27 Briefly, apnea was 
defined as !90% decrease in airflow and hypopnea was a 
!50% decrease in airflow associated with reduced arterial 
oxygen saturation in !3% or an arousal for duration of !2 
breaths. Disease severity in children was further characterized 
as primary snoring (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI &lt;1/h), 
mild OSA (AHI 1-5/h), and moderate-to-severe OSA 
(AHI !5/h). </p>

<p>21-26 </p>

<p>24-Hour ABP </p>

<p>All participants received 24-hour ABP monitoring using 
the Oscar 2 oscillometric monitor (SunTech Medical, Model 
222, Morrisville, NC), which has been validated by the Inter-
national Protocol of the European Society of Hypertension and 
British Hypertension Society. 
28,29 Measurements were obtained 
with the appropriately sized cuff on the nondominant arm. 
Participants were asked to maintain their usual activity but to 
remain still during daytime measurements. The monitors were 
programmed for daytime (7 AM to 10 PM) measurements of BP at 
15-minute intervals and for nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) measure-
ments of BP at 30-minute intervals. The cutoff for daytime and 
nighttime was defined according to the sleep diary derived from 
parents or children. Extreme outlier BP readings were assumed 
to be invalid and were discarded as artifacts. Therefore, visual 
inspections of grossly inconsistent readings were made before 
interpretation, and only measurements with systolic BP &lt;240 
and &gt;70 mmHg, diastolic BP &lt;140 and &gt;40 mmHg, heart rate 
&lt;125 beats/min, and pulse pressure &gt;40 but &lt;100 mmHg with 
a diastolic BP &lt;systolic BP were considered valid. </p>

<p>30 </p>

<p>Mean systolic, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure 
(MAP) were calculated for daytime and nighttime. The BP load 
was defined as percentage of valid BP measurements &gt;95th 
percentile of BP for age and sex. Different age and sex groups 
were compared by applying the BP index. 
30 The BP index was </p>

<p>calculated by using the following formula: BP index ¼ (measured 
BP -95 
th percentile)/95 
th percentile Â 100. 
12 Hypertension was 
defined as mean SBP or DBP values &gt; 95th percentile of the ABP 
norm. </p>

<p>30 </p>

<p>Nocturnal dipping of systolic and diastolic BP was calcu-
lated as the difference between mean daytime and nighttime BP 
and expressed as a percentage of dipping. Subjects with noc-
turnal BP dipping &lt;10% were defined as nondippers. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis </p>

<p>Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">20.0</rs> (IBM 
Corporation, New York, NY). Continuous data were expressed 
as the mean and standard deviation, and categorical data were 
expressed as the number and percentage. The distribution of 
continuous variables among the disease severity groups was 
compared by Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni post hoc 
multiple comparison when the overall test was significant. 
Differences in proportions between groups were examined with 
the Fisher exact test. The association between the sleep 
parameter (ie, AHI) and BP measurements was investigated 
by multivariable linear regression analysis. The AHI values 
were logarithmically transformed (natural log [x þ0.1]) because 
its distribution was skewed and contained zero. Several models 
were constructed to evaluate associations between AHI and BP 
parameters with adjustment for age, sex, height, and adiposity 
(ie, BMI, BMI percentile, and obesity). A P value &lt;0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Demographics </p>

<p>From September 2012 to March 2015, children with 
symptoms suggestive of OSA were invited to participate. 
The final analysis included 195 subjects who had overnight 
PSG data and ABP measurements. Mean age was 7.8 AE 3.4 
years; 69.0% (134/195) were male. For OSA groups, 17.4% (34/ 
195) had primary snoring (AHI &lt;1), 39.5% (77/195) had mild 
OSA (5 ! AHI &gt;1), and 43.1% (84/195) had moderate-to-
severe OSA (AHI &gt;5). Table 1 compares the basic character-
istics and PSG data among children with different disease 
severity. Children with moderate-to severe OSA had a higher 
BMI, BMI percentile, and the prevalence of obesity than that of 
primary snoring children. Children with mild OSA had a higher 
BMI percentile than that of primary snorers. Not surprisingly, 
children with higher AHI levels also had a significantly higher 
oxygen desaturation index, arousal index, and lower mean and 
minimum oxygen saturation. </p>

<p>BP During Daytime </p>

<p>During daytime, children with moderate-to-severe OSA 
had significantly higher systolic BP (117.0 AE 12.7 vs 110.5 AE 
9.3 mmHg), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (85.6 AE 8.1 vs. 
81.6 AE 6.8 mmHg), and diastolic BP load (12.0 AE 9.6 vs. 
8.4 AE 10.9 mmHg) compared with children with primary snor-
ing. However, systolic and diastolic BP index did not signifi-
cantly differ among OSA subgroups. Additionally, the daytime 
prevalence of systolic and diastolic hypertension did not 
significantly differ among the OSA subgroups (Table 2) 
(Figures 1-3). </p>

<p>Blood Pressure During Nighttime </p>

<p>During nighttime, children with moderate-to-severe 
OSA had significantly higher systolic BP (108.6 AE 15.0 vs </p>

<p>100.0 AE 9.4 mmHg), MAP (75.9 AE 9.6 vs 71.1 AE 7.0 mmHg), 
pulse pressure (49.2 AE 10.4 vs 43.4 AE 6.1 mmHg), systolic BP 
load (44.0 AE 32.6 vs 26.8 AE 24.5 mmHg), systolic BP index 
(0.5 AE 13.1 vs À6.8 AE 8.5 mmHg), and prevalence of systolic 
hypertension (47.6 vs. 14.7 %) compared to primary snoring 
children. Table 2 shows that children with moderate-to-severe 
OSA had significantly higher systolic BP (108.6 AE 15.0 vs 
103.0 AE 13.3 mmHg), MAP (75.9 AE 9.6 vs 72.3 AE 9.2 mmHg), 
systolic BP load (44.0 AE 32.6 vs 30.6 AE 29.3 mmHg), and sys-
tolic BP index (0.5 AE 13.1 vs À4.2 AE 12.4 mmHg) compared 
with children with mild OSA (Figures 1-3). </p>

<p>Nocturnal BP Dipping </p>

<p>Compared with those with mild OSA, children with mod-
erate-to-severe OSA had significantly lower systolic nocturnal 
BP dipping (7.1 AE 8.6 vs 10.0 AE 7.8 mmHg). However, diastolic 
nocturnal BP and the proportion of nondippers did not signifi-
cantly differ among the 3 OSA subgroups (Table 2). </p>

<p>Multivariable Linear Regression Analyses </p>

<p>Multiple linear regression models were used to explore 
associations between AHI and BP parameters after adjusting for 
possible confounders (ie, age, sex, height, and adiposity vari-
ables) (Table 3). Unadjusted analysis showed the AHI was 
positively correlated with daytime systolic BP, daytime MAP, 
nighttime systolic BP, nighttime diastolic BP, and nighttime 
MAP. Associations between AHI and daytime BP parameters </p>

<p>were partially affected by adiposity, whereas AHI correlated 
positively with nighttime systolic BP and MAP after adjusting 
possible confounders. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>This large, hospital-based study elaborates associations 
between ABP and OSA in children. Analytical results show 
that children with OSA had elevated ABP with increased 
disease severity. In this study cohort, children with moder-
ate-to-severe OSA had significantly higher daytime systolic BP 
and diastolic BP load compared with primary snorers. In 
children with moderate-to-severe OSA, nighttime systolic 
BP, systolic BP load, and systolic BP index were also signifi-
cantly higher compared with primary snorers. The effect of 
OSA on nighttime BP is independent of obesity. These findings 
provide robust evidence that, in children with OSA, BP is higher 
in those who are primary snorers. From a clinical perspective, 
elevated BP in childhood predicts future cardiovascular 
risks. 
31-32 Therefore, children with severe OSA require 
monitoring of cardiovascular parameters and proper treatment 
to prevent further adverse cardiovascular consequences. 
In children, Guilleminault et al 
7 first linked OSA to 
elevated BP. 
7-12 However, a meta-analysis by Zintzaras 
et al 
13 offered insufficient evidence that moderate-to-severe 
OSA was associated with hypertension, a finding that may be 
confounded by a small sample size and large heterogeneity 
among studies. In contrast, many recent studies demonstrated a </p>

<p>trend of elevated BP in children with OSA. 
8 -12,33-35 Li et al </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>and Xu et al 
12 reported a dose-response relationship between 
OSA and BP in children. Horne et al 
35 indicated that pediatric 
OSA increased BP during sleep more than in control, regardless 
of OSA severity. Weber et al 
11 showed that children with OSA 
had higher diastolic and mean BP compared with those of 
primary snoring. The present study found that moderate-to-
severe OSA was associated with elevated BP during daytime 
and nighttime. In children, OSA also had a strong correlation 
with systolic BP during nighttime, and the correlation was 
independent of obesity. These findings indicate that childhood 
OSA is associated with elevated BP. Interestingly, the </p>

<p>prevalence of non-dippers in this study did not significantly 
differ among OSA subgroups. However, children with moder-
ate-to-severe OSA had less systolic nocturnal dipping. Pre-
viously, Li et al, Horne et al, and Nisbet et al observed that 
nocturnal dipping is preserved in young children with 
OSA. 
8,36,37 But Weber et al 
11 demonstrated children with 
OSA had decreased degree of nocturnal dipping. In these 
children, exposure to the effects of OSA was sufficiently long 
or the disease severity was sufficiently high to affect nocturnal 
dipping profiles. Therefore, OSA and cardiovascular effects 
may be resolved when appropriate treatment is administrated. 
Impacts of pediatric OSA on cardiovascular effects have 
received increasing attention. 
31-43 Evidence of autonomic dys-
function was found in children with OSA during both wakeful-
ness and sleep. 
33-35 Moreover, BP dysregulation, elevated 
sympathetic activity and impairment of autonomic reflexes 
occur in school-aged children and adolescents with OSA. </p>

<p>39-</p>

<p>42 Notably, cardiovascular consequences of OSA occur not only 
in children with OSA, but also in children with primary snor-
ing. 
43 This hospital-based study recruited participants with 
clinical symptoms. Therefore, cardiovascular comparisons 
between children with OSA and normal controls were not 
obtained. 
High BP in adulthood is a well-established risk factor for 
early disability and death. 
44 Although BP levels in childhood 
cannot be directly linked with cardiovascular events in adults, a 
number of studies have reported that intermediate markers of 
target organ damage, including left ventricular hypertrophy, 
atherosclerosis, or cognitive dysfunction, are detectable in 
children and adolescents with elevated BP. 
31,32,45 -47 Impor-
tantly, elevated BP in children continues into adulthood and is 
often associated with modifiable risk factors such as lack of 
physical activity, obesity, and sleep problems. 
31,32,48,49 If the 
diagnosis of high BP is not made, associated risk factors are 
unlikely to decrease. This study highlighted correlations 
between increased BP and OSA in children, implying early 
awareness and proper treatment should be considered in </p>

<p>this category of patients to prevent further cardiovascular 
complications. 
This study has certain limitations. First, this study lacked a 
normal control group. 
50 In this hospital-based study, primary 
snorers were the comparison group. However, children who are 
primary snorers are not considered innocent anymore, 
51 and 
evidence exists that children with primary snoring had higher 
BP levels compared with normal controls. 
43 Second, this study 
was a cross-sectional study. Further longitudinal, prospective 
studies are needed to elucidate long-term changes of OSA and 
its association with BP. 
52-55 Third, this study did not link BP 
with other cardiovascular measurements, and evidence of early 
target-organ damage in children with OSA was not obtained. </p>

<p>56 </p>

<p>Finally, because of the lack of normal BP reference in Taiwa-
nese children, this study used normative data for the US 
population. 
30 Future studies should examine effect of treatment 
on BP in children with sleep disturbances. </p>

<p>18,57 -60 </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>This large, hospital-based study shows that daytime and 
nighttime BP levels elevated with increased severity of OSA in 
children. Compared with children with primary snoring, those 
with moderate-to-severe OSA had a significantly higher BP. 
This study identified a correlation between OSA severity and 
nighttime BP, and the correlation was independent of obesity. 
Since elevated BP in childhood predicts future cardiovascular 
risks, children with OSA and hypertension should receive 
proper treatment to prevent further adverse cardiovascular 
consequences. Further studies are needed to elucidate the 
impacts of surgery or other treatment strategies on BP 
parameters in children with obstructive sleep disorders. </p>
