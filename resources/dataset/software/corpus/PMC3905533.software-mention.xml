<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Background: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of smoking behaviors among students in 
Tehran University, Iran. </p>

<p>Methods: This was a cross-sectional study on 400 participants of Tehran University. A self-
administrated, anonymous questionnaire was used for data gathering. </p>

<p>Findings: The mean age of students was 21.70  2.73 years, and 92% of them were single. The 
prevalence of smoking was 27.3% including 35.4% of men and 12.6% of women (P &lt; 0.001). The mean 
duration of smoking was 4.22  3.05 years. There was a significant association between smoking 
behaviors among students and their age, gender, type of accommodation, field of study, income status, 
duration of study, and existence of smoking habits among family members. </p>

<p>Conclusion: The prevalence of cigarette smoking among university students is high. The lack of 
adequate information about smoking related diseases indicates the incapability and inefficiency of 
educational programs on this issue. </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Smoking is the risk factor of many diseases, and is 
also considered to be a major worldwide health 
issue. It is estimated that smoking and tobacco-
related illnesses lead to death of approximately 
5.4 million people around the world annually. 1 
This figure will reach 8.3 million in 2030 which 
will be the cause of 10 percent of mortalities 
globally. 2 
Smoking still has a high prevalence among 
teenagers, and the age many begin to smoke is 
declining. 3 This behavior among university 
students is of high importance, since as an 
educated class of society they can impact all the 
population of society. Many studies have been 
implemented on the prevalence of smoking and 
its predisposing factors among university 
students. These studies indicate that the 
prevalence of smoking has a growing trend in 
universities. 4,5 Nazary et al. found that 43.5 
percent of students started smoking after entering 
the university. 5 
Currently, contrary to many countries, 
smoking in Public Places is not prohibited in Iran. 
Hence, smokers are under no social pressure to 
withdraw from smoking. Many Iranian studies 
have shown that the number of smoking people 
among community members, 6-9 academic 
educated population, 4,5,10-12 and/or even school 
students 13-15 is growing. The above mentioned 
studies reported that between 11 to 15 percent of 
the population in Iran smoke. 
Since university students, as an educated 
group of society, can have a more effective role in 
the prevention and reduction of smoking in 
society, determination of smoking prevalence is 
necessary among this group. The present study 
aimed to evaluate the prevalence of smoking and 
its related factors among students of Tehran 
University. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>This was a cross-sectional descriptive-analytical 
study among the students of Tehran University. 
The data was collected between May and 
August 2010. The research protocol was 
approved in the Ethic Committee, and was done 
according to the ethical standards set by the 
Helsinki 
Convention. 
According 
to 
a 
preliminary study, and by using the sample size 
formula for descriptive studies with an 
estimated prevalence (P) of 20%, accuracy of </p>

<p>estimation error (d) of 4% and α of 5%, the 
sample size was calculated to be 384 samples. 
Therefore, a sample size with 400 participants 
was considered and they were selected using 
convenient random sampling (through table of 
random numbers by <rs id="software-1" type="software">Microsoft Excel</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-date">2007</rs>). 
An anonymous questionnaire including 46 
questions was prepared by the researcher and 
validated during a preliminary study on a group 
of participants. The first and second parts of the 
questionnaire 
reviewed 
demographic 
characteristics (22 questions) and smoking status 
(23 questions), respectively. Finally, one question 
asked about the accuracy rate at the time of 
completing the questionnaire. The second part 
must only be completed by smokers. The 
students were informed about the confidentiality 
of their information, study objective and how to 
complete it orally and in writing. Thereafter, the 
questionnaires were completed by the students 
under supervision of the researcher and 
returned in the same session. All the participants 
of the study completed the questionnaire. 
Descriptive statistics included the frequency 
distribution table and mean (SD), and were 
obtained through the Software <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 17</rs>. 
In addition, chi-square and/or Fisher's exact test 
was used to compare the quantitative variables, 
independent t-test and/or Mann-Whitney U test 
to compare means, and also univariate and 
multivariable logistic regression analysis via 
<rs type="software">Stata</rs> software. P-value of less than 0.05 was 
defined as a statistically significant level. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>In total out of 400 students, 257 students (64.3%) 
were male and 143 of them were female (35.8%). 
The mean age of students was 21.70 ± 2.73 years. 
368 students (92%) were single. 23.3 percent of 
them used to study in art, 25.3 percent in human 
sciences, 26.8 percent in mathematics and 
engineering fields and 24.8 percent in sciences. 
109 students (27.3%) stated that they smoke. 
The mean smoking duration was 4.22 ± 3.05 
years. 61.3 percent of students started smoking 
after entering the university. The smoking rate 
increased after entering the university in 69 
students (63.3%), while it had no effect on 34 
samples (31.2%), and it reduced in 6 samples 
(5.5%). 
In 44.3 percent of samples (47 students) the 
parents were unaware of their children smoking, </p>

<p>
and in 44.3 percent (47 students) the parents were 
opposed to smoking. Almost 15.7% of smoking 
students announced they never smoke in public 
places, and 46.3 percent of them smoke in public 
places if they need to, and 38 percent stated that 
they smoke in public places. 
The most common occasions for smoking 
respectively were 79.8% when they are upset, 
76.1% when they are with friends and 67% after 
a meal. 
The results of a univariate analysis, which 
indicated the impact of different variables on 
smoking, are illustrated in table 1. There were 
some significant factors among smoking students. 
As indicated in Table 1, age, sex, residence status, 
education, duration of academic year, previous 
GPA (grade point average), income source and 
rate, and also presence of smoking family </p>

<p>members in the household were significantly 
related to being a smoker (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, being 
male (35.4% male vs. 12.6% female), living in 
rented houses or with living relatives, education 
in the field of art or human sciences, having lower 
GPA, prolonged time of education, having 
personal income, and also presence of smoking 
family members in the household was related to 
being a smoking student. 
The final regression model is illustrated in 
table 2 by conducting a multivariate logistic 
regression analysis, and deleting the variables of 
source of financing and also the number of 
academic years in university. 
There was no significant difference between 
the smoking and non-smoking students in terms 
of marital status, the number of family members, 
father's job and lack of one of parent (P &gt; 0.05). </p>

<p>The Prevalence of Smoking and its Related Factors </p>

<p>Jafari et al. </p>

<p>Only 62 students (56.9%) were familiar with 
smoking-related diseases and complications. 49 
smoking students (45%) had attempted to stop 
smoking and 80 students (73.4%) said their 
desire to withdraw from smoking has been low 
and very low. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>The present study reviewed smoking in Tehran 
University. More than one forth of students 
announced they smoke; its prevalence in male 
and female students was 35.4 and 12.6 percent 
respectively. Although the mentioned rate is 
lower than some European and American 
countries, according to the results of some 
studies in Iran, its prevalence in Tehran is 
higher than other cities. 
In 2002, in a comprehensive study in 23 
countries of the world (Europe, the U.S., Asia, 
South Africa and Latin America), the 
prevalence of smoking was calculated in 
universities 
(except 
Medical 
Sciences 
students). 16 Comparing the results of this study 
to the present study, the prevalence of smoking 
among men in Tehran was similar to Western 
European countries, the U.S. (31%), Central 
Europe, Eastern Europe, Asian countries, and 
Latin America (35%). However, the prevalence 
rate in the present study was lower than in 
Southern European countries (44%) and higher 
than South Africa and Thailand (14%). 
The prevalence of smoking among women of 
the present study was still relatively lower than 
many European and American studies (28-39%) 
but was similar to Asian and Latin American 
countries (15%). Khami et al. 4 in Iran in a study 
on dental students in Tehran showed that the 
smoking rate was 23 percent (32.7 and 14.6% in 
men and women, respectively) among students. 
However, among other studies in cities except 
Tehran, the prevalence of smoking has been 
reported in 11% of students in Kerman (22% 
men and 2.4% women) 12 , in 14.4% of students in 
Semnan 5 , and in 18.48% of students in Shiraz 10 
which had a lower prevalence than our study. 
According to the study of Fotouhi et al., 8 the 
overall prevalence of smoking in Tehran is 
11.9% (20.6 and 2.9% for men and women, 
respectively). This rate was much lower than 
our results among the students of Tehran 
University. This point emphasized the necessity 
of conducting a more active approach in </p>

<p>evaluation of and prevention from smoking 
among students. 
Many studies have reported a higher 
prevalence of smoking among men than 
women which were in accordance with the 
present study. However, unlike the present 
study and similar Asian researches, this 
difference was not significant in Western 
Countries. 16 
Moreover, some other factors were related to 
high prevalence of smoking among students 
including age, living in student homes instead of 
dormitories, education in fields of Art and 
Human Sciences, low GPA, prolonged education 
duration, having personal income and smoking 
members in their families. Living without 
parents (due to study in university) is associated 
with freedom of previous limitations which can 
lead to some considerable changes in an 
individual's life, particularly among students 
with lower awareness and knowledge. This 
situation can be more prominent due to 
economic independence and living alone. A 
similar result was obtained in Lebanon by 
Tamim et al. 17 
This study showed that smoking is an easy 
way to reduce tension in the critical period of 
separation from family and individual 
autonomy. More prevalence of smoking in some 
majors (Art and Human Sciences fields) showed 
the lower knowledge of these groups. On the 
contrary, the students of Experimental Sciences 
(such as courses related to Medical Sciences) 
showed significantly lower prevalence of 
smoking. Although this difference between the 
students from different majors was not seen in 
some studies, 18 the need for effective education 
against smoking students has been raised in all 
of the studies. Raising awareness about smoking 
complications and side-effects, and its related 
diseases can prevent such an unhealthy behavior 
or it can even encourage them to withdraw from 
smoking. This subject emphasizes on identifying 
factors which influence the effectiveness of 
training programs in this field. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>It seems that there are very few studies (or 
there is not enough education) about the 
harmful effects of smoking on physical and 
mental health as well as about costs associated 
with addiction to various substances such as </p>

<p>
cigarettes. Lack of knowledge and awareness of 
the educated class of society about risks of 
smoking exclusively indicated the necessity of 
serious attention of authorities to implement 
control and preventive programs with a nation-
wide approach to solve this issue. </p>
