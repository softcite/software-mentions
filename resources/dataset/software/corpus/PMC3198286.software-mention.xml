<p>OBJECTIVEdTo investigate the effects of inflammation on perfusion regulation and brain 
volumes in type 2 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdA total of 147 subjects (71 diabetic and 76 
nondiabetic, aged 65.2 6 8 years) were studied using 3T anatomical and continuous arterial spin 
labeling magnetic resonance imaging. Analysis focused on the relationship between serum sol-
uble vascular and intercellular adhesion molecules (sVCAM and sICAM, respectively, both 
markers of endothelial integrity), regional vasoreactivity, and tissue volumes. </p>

<p>RESULTSdDiabetic subjects had greater vasoconstriction reactivity, more atrophy, depres-
sion, and slower walking. Adhesion molecules were specifically related to gray matter atrophy 
(P = 0.04) and altered vasoreactivity (P = 0.03) in the diabetic and control groups. Regionally, 
sVCAM and sICAM were linked to exaggerated vasoconstriction, blunted vasodilatation, and 
increased cortical atrophy in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes (P = 0.04-0.003). sICAM 
correlated with worse functionality. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdDiabetes is associated with cortical atrophy, vasoconstriction, and worse 
performance. Adhesion molecules, as markers of vascular health, have been indicated to con-
tribute to altered vasoregulation and atrophy. </p>

<p>Anatomical and perfusion images were 
acquired on a 3T GE HDx MRI scanner 
using three-dimensional magnetization 
prepared rapid gradient echo, fluid atten-
uated inversion recovery, and three-
dimensional continuous arterial spin 
labeling sequences (11). Regional cerebral 
vasoreactivity to CO 2 challenges (CO 2 VR) 
was measured as blood flow response 
to hypercapnia (CO 2 rebreathing with 
95% air and 5% CO 2 ) and hyperventila-
tion (12,13). CO 2 VR was calculated as the 
slope of the regression between perfusion 
and CO 2 during normocapnia, hypercap-
nia, and hypocapnia. Flow augmentation 
during hypercapnia (i.e., vasodilation 
response, CO 2 VR-VD) and flow reduc-
tion during hyperventilation (i.e., vaso-
constriction response, CO 2 VR-VC) were 
quantified. Magnetization prepared rapid 
gradient echo and fluid attenuated inver-
sion recovery images were coregistered 
to a standard template and segmented 
to calculate regional brain tissue and 
WMH volumes normalized for intracra-
nial volume (SPM<rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">7</rs>, University College 
<rs id="software-9" type="software">IDL</rs><rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Research Systems</rs><rs id="software-10" type="software">MATLAB</rs><rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">MathWorks</rs>MA) (12,13). Perfusion and vasoreactivity 
maps were coregistered with anatomical 
images. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
We used least square models to assess the 
relationships between adhesion mole-
cules and regional vasoreactivity, gray 
matter (GM), white matter, cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), and WMHs. Variables with 
significant correlations (r 
2 .0.1, P , 
0.05) were included in the models. Over-
all model fit (r 
2 ) and P values were calcu-
lated separately for each region to 
minimize repeated measures effects. 
Models were adjusted for age, sex, and 
group or glucose. Perfusion models were 
also adjusted for CO 2 and hematocrit. 
MANCOVA with Sidak adjustment was 
used for comparisons across regions and 
between groups. Demographics and labo-
ratory values were compared by ANOVA 
and Wilcoxon tests. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Characteristics of diabetic and 
control groups 
Compared with control subjects, diabetic 
subjects had elevated fasting glycemia 
(124.4 6 7.4 vs. 79.3 6 1.6 mg/dL, P , 
0.0001), HbA 1c (7.1 6 0.1 vs. 5.4 6 
0.1%, P , 0.0001), BMI (28.4 6 0.6 vs. 
25.3 6 0.6 kg/m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>, P , 0.0001), and tumor 
necrosis factor-a (1.8 6 0.1 vs. 1.5 6 0.1 
pg/mL, P = 0.0004). Soluble intercellular 
adhesion molecule (sICAM; 246.2 6 13.9 
vs. 226.5 6 5.8 ng/mL), soluble vascular 
adhesion molecule (sVCAM; 758.6 6 28.4 
vs. 729.9 6 20.7 ng/mL), endothelin-1, in-
terleukin-6, and CRP were not different. 
Diabetic subjects were more depressed 
(6.0 6 0.8 vs. 2.8 6 0.9, P = 0.003) and 
walked slower (1.06 6 02 vs. 1.12 6 
0.02 m/s, P = 0.02) than control subjects. 
Diabetic subjects had lower GM vol-
umes (parietal and occipital lobes and 
cerebellum, P , 0.02) (Fig. 1A) and 
greater WMH volume globally (P = 
0.0004) and in the temporal, parietal, 
and occipital lobes (P , 0.01) (Fig. 1B). 
Baseline perfusion and CO 2 VR-VD were 
similar (Fig. 1C), yet the diabetic group 
had exaggerated CO 2 VR-VC in the fron-
tal, parietal, and occipital regions (P , 
0.01) (Fig. 1D). 
Adhesion molecules, brain tissue vol-
umes, and vasoreactivity. Adhesion 
molecules were associated with decreased 
GM volume, exaggerated CO 2 VR-VC, and 
blunted CO 2 VR-VD in both groups 
(Fig. 1A-D). sVCAM was linked to lower </p>

<p>GM volumes globally (r 
2 = 0.24, P = 0.04) 
and regionally (temporal and parietal, r 
2 = 
0.13-0.23, P = 0.02-0.006), greater CSF 
volumes globally (r 
2 = 0.12, P = 0.05) and 
regionally (temporal and occipital, r 
2 = 
0.07-0.12, P = 0.03-0.007), and blunted 
CO 2 VR-VD (parietal and occipital, r 
2 = 
0.12-16, P = 0.03). Higher sICAM and 
glucose levels were related to GM atrophy 
(frontal, temporal, and parietal, r 
2 = 0.14-
29, P = 0.02-0.003) and blunted global 
CO 2 VR-VD (r 
2 = 0.09, P = 0.03) and ex-
aggerated CO 2 VR-VC (frontal, temporal, 
and parietal, r 
2 = 0.12-16, P = 0.03-
0.01). sICAM was linked to slower walking 
(r 
2 = 0.12, P = 0.01) and worse behavioral 
measures (r 
2 = 0.16, P = 0.03). 
Within the diabetic group, the rela-
tionships between adhesion molecules 
and brain measures were stronger; 
sVCAM was associated with GM atrophy 
(temporal r 
2 = 0.13, P = 0.05; parietal r 
2 = 
0.4, P = 0.02), and sICAM was associated 
with altered vasodilatation (global r 
2 = 
0.32, P = 0.02; parietal r 
2 = 0.32, P = 
0.02). sICAM (r 
2 = 0.24, P = 0.0003) and 
sVCAM (r 
2 = 0.24, P = 0.0003) correlated 
with glycemia but not with HbA 1c , medi-
cations, diabetes duration, or hyper-
tension. In control subjects, sVCAM 
correlated with greater CSF volume (r 
2 = 
0.24, P = 0.03). sICAM was related to 
smaller CSF volume (r 
2 = 0.26, P = 
0.0007) and greater GM volume (fron-
tal, temporal, and parietal, r 
2 = 0.24-43, 
P = 0.01-0.003). 
Tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-
6, endothelin-1, and CRP were not related 
to brain volumes or vasoreactivity mea-
sures. WMHs were not associated with ad-
hesion molecules, inflammation markers, 
or regional vasoreactivity. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdMarkers of endo-
thelial integrity (sVCAM and sICAM) 
were specifically associated with altered 
cortical vasoreactivity and GM atrophy in 
multiple brain regions in both diabetic 
and nondiabetic participants. These rela-
tionships were independent of WMHs 
and were not observed for other inflam-
matory markers. The diabetic group ex-
hibited exaggerated vasoconstriction, 
more atrophy, lower functionality, and 
more depression. sVCAM was associated 
with atrophy affecting temporal and pa-
rietal cortices. sICAM and glucose levels 
were related to exaggerated vasoconstric-
tion and regional cortical atrophy. Adhe-
sion molecules were linked to slower 
walking and executive and behavioral </p>

<p>dysfunction, which are hallmarks of be-
havioral decline in older adults. 
The relationship between adhesion 
molecules and vasoreactivity to CO 2 chal-
lenges suggests a nitric oxide-dependent 
endothelial dysfunction (15). Observa-
tions of microglial activation and sVCAM 
expression in the cortex and subcortical 
areas support this notion and indicate 
that insulin resistance and obesity may 
facilitate an inflammatory process in the 
brain (9). A combination of altered vasore-
gulation and hyperglycemia may enhance 
neurotoxicity of chronic hyperglycemia in 
the aging diabetic brain. </p>
