<p>Cardiovascular disease risk is associated with excess body weight and elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) 
concentrations. This study examines how an alternate-day fasting (ADF) diet high (HF) or low (LF) in fat 
affects plasma FFA profiles in the context of weight loss, and changes in body composition and lipid profiles. 
After a 2-week weight maintenance period, 29 women (BMI 30-39.9 kg/m 
2 ) 25-65 years old were 
randomized to an 8-week ADF-HF (45% fat) diet or an ADF-LF (25% fat) diet with 25% energy intake on fast 
days and ad libitum intake on feed days. Body weight, BMI and waist circumference were assessed weekly 
and body composition was measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Total and individual FFA and 
plasma lipid concentrations were measured before and after weight loss. Body weight, BMI, fat mass, total 
cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride concentrations decreased (P , 0.05) in both groups. Total FFA 
concentrations also decreased (P , 0.001). In the ADF-LF group, decreases were found in several more FFAs 
than in the ADF-HF group. In the ADF-HF group, FFA concentrations were positively correlated with waist 
circumference. Depending on the macronutrient composition of a diet, weight loss with an ADF diet 
decreases FFA concentrations through potentially different mechanisms. </p>

<p>Weight loss, body composition and plasma lipid concentrations. 
During the initial weight maintenance period (week 1-2), no between-
group differences were found in any of the baseline characteristics. 
Over the 8-week ADF diet period, both the ADF-HF and the ADF-LF 
groups decreased (P , 0.05) in weight, BMI, fat mass, and waist 
circumference WC (Table 1). There were no differences in the 
extent of weight loss, changes in BMI, and WC between groups. 
There was a trend (P 5 0.09) for a group*time interaction in fat 
mass. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides decreased in both 
groups (P , 0.05) during the weight loss period, whereas HDL-C did 
not change over time. There was a trend (P 5 0.08) for a group*time 
interaction in LDL-C whereby a larger decrease in LDL-C was 
observed in the ADF-LF vs. the ADF-HF group. </p>

<p>FFA concentrations. With weight loss, total FFAs decreased (P , 
0.001) in the ADF-LF group by an average of 98.62 6 3.66 mmol/L. A 
trend was found (P 5 0.05) in the ADF-HF group, where total FFA 
decreased by 53.93 6 3.73 mmol/L (Figure 1). Changes in total FFA 
concentrations did not differ between groups. Significant decreases 
were observed in LNA (P 5 0.01), MA (P 5 0.049), AA (P 5 0.007), 
LA (P 5 0.004), PA (P 5 0.001) and OA (P 5 0.001) in the ADF-LF 
group (Table 2). In contrast, in the ADF-HF group there were </p>

<p>significant reductions in FFA concentrations of LNA (P 5 0.02) 
and LA (P 5 0.048). </p>

<p>Relationship between changes in body composition and FFA 
concentrations. Overall, a decrease in weight correlated with a 
decrease in MA (r 5 0.391; P 5 0.039). In the ADF-LF group 
weight loss correlated with decreases in DHA (r 5 0.642; P 5 
0.013). In the ADF-HF group, lower fat mass correlated with 
decreases in LA (r 5 0.635; P 5 0.015). Changes in waist 
circumference in the ADF-HF group correlated with changes in 
LNA (r 5 0.554; P 5 0.040), LA (r 5 0.700; P 5 0.005), PA (r 5 
0.623; P 5 0.017), OA (r 5 0.610; P 5 0.027), and total FFA (r 5 
0.623; P 5 0.017) (Figure 2). No correlation was found between waist 
circumference and any FFA in the ADF-LF group. </p>

<p>Relationship between changes in FFA and lipid concentrations. In 
the ADF-HF group, changes in LNA concentrations negatively 
correlated with total cholesterol (r 5 20.601; P 5 0.023) and HDL 
(r 5 20.548; P 5 0.042). In the ADF-HF group, DHA negatively 
correlated (r 5 20.573; P 5 0.032) with LDL-C. In the ADF-LF 
group, LA was positively correlated (r 5 0.508; P 5 0.044) with 
HDL-C. </p>

Discussion 
Elevated total and individual plasma FFA concentrations observed in 
obesity have been linked with cardiovascular disease risk </p>

<p>1,2,5 </p>

<p>. During 
weight loss, diet composition may affect FFA concentrations 
6,7 . Our 
study examined the effect of weight loss with a high fat ADF diet on 
total and individual FFA concentrations compared to a low fat ADF 
diet. We found that after weight loss, both groups had decreases in 
total FFA concentrations. However, even though weight loss and 
regional body composition results were similar between the two 
groups, almost all FFAs in the ADF-LF group decreased whereas 
changes were only noted in LA and LNA in the ADF-HF group. 
Despite similar changes in waist circumference, decreases in WC 
were correlated with decreases in several individual FFAs in the 
ADF-HF group only. 
In our study, we evaluated circulating concentrations of FFA. 
Elevated total and individual plasma FFA concentrations observed 
in obesity have been linked with cardiovascular disease risk and 
atherosclerosis 
1,5,18,19 . FFAs has been observed to impair vasodilation 
in blood vessels through activating apoptosis in the endothelium 
20 . 
Furthermore, FFA is the main energy source for the myocardium; 
high levels of FFA play a role in damaging the myocardium, exacer-
bating heart failure and leading to myocardial infarction 
21 . Thus far, 
no ADF studies have analysed circulating FFA profiles in order to 
determine whether any cardio-protective changes occur at the FFA 
level. The results of our FFA analysis show that weight loss with an 
ADF diet decreases total FFA concentrations, and that both the ADF-
LF and ADF-HF diets could be effective at reducing FFA concentra-
tions. Though no significant group*time interactions were observed, 
the decrease in total FFA concentrations with an ADF-LF diet was 
almost 2 times that of the ADF-HF diet. Previously, effects of weight 
loss on FFA concentrations appear to be variable with some studies 
showing decreases in FFA 
11,13,14 , while others show no change 
22-24 or 
even increases 
25-27 in FFA. Some of these studies achieved weight loss 
using a very low calorie diet, surgery or hypocaloric diets with vary-
ing macronutrient composition. Therefore, the dietary regimen used 
in these studies during the weight loss period may be a source of 
variability in changes of FFA to weight loss. 
Individual FFA concentrations have been shown to contribute to 
CVD risk differently. Thrombosis and arrhythmia have been assoc-
iated with a number of saturated FFA including palmitic acid 
28,29 . 
Palmitic, oleic, and myristic acid have been positively associated with 
lipid risk factors of CVD 
6 . Our study also showed that LA, DHA and 
LNA were associated with lipid risk factors of CVD. Patients post-
myocardial infarction were also shown to have greater palmitic and 
oleic acid and lower linoleic acid compared to age-matched con-
trols 
30 . With an ADF-LF diet, we observed a significant reduction 
in more types of FFAs (LNA, MA, AA, LA, PA and OA) vs. in the </p>

<p>ADF-HF group (LNA and LA). This suggests that the low fat ADF 
diet was more effective at decreasing FFA concentrations vs. the high 
fat ADF diet. To our knowledge this is the first study to examine 
changes in individual FFA composition in the context of a weight loss 
program using ADF with varying macronutrient composition. 
Normal weight participants who consumed a high fat diet also 
observed changes in the proportion of LA and LNA compared with 
a low fat diet 
31 . These results suggest that LA and LNA are more 
sensitive to changes with the consumption of a high fat diet. 
Therefore, combining a high fat diet with weight loss via an ADF 
protocol would likely have a greater effect on these FFAs, as observed 
in this study. 
There were strong correlations in the ADF-HF group where 
decreases in waist circumference were associated with decreases in 
several FFAs. In contrast, there were no such correlations between 
waist circumference and FFAs in the ADF-LF group. Waist circum-
ference is considered a surrogate marker of abdominal adiposity and 
visceral fat mass 
32 . We hypothesize that in weight loss, the levels of 
dietary fat intake and changes in abdominal fat have a collective effect 
on decreases in FFA concentrations. The relatively larger contri-
bution of a diet low in fat to changes in FFA concentrations may 
mask the relationship between abdominal fat mass and FFA concen-
trations. In contrast, weight loss with a high fat diet may have a 
smaller effect in lowering FFA concentrations in comparison to the 
greater effect of decreases in abdominal fat. Regardless of the relative 
contribution of dietary fat content on FFA lowering, changes in 
abdominal fat mass during weight loss with an ADF diet resulted 
in cardioprotective changes in FFA concentrations. 
A major strength of the study was that both the ADF-LF and ADF-
HF group were matched for body composition. Additionally, body 
composition changed equally in the ADF-LF and ADF-HF groups. 
Thus, the effects of a HF and LF diet on FFA concentrations could be 
examined without the confounding effects of changes in body com-
position. Additionally, since all the meals were provided and the ratio 
of SFA:MUFA:PUFA was similar in the high and low fat diets, the 
effects of overall fat content on FFA concentrations could be isolated. 
Due to a communication error during sample processing, hor-
monal regulators of lipolysis were not measured. While insulin inhi-
bits FFA release, other hormones such as epinephrine stimulate FFA 
release over a wide range 
33,34 . Thus, we are not able to determine the 
mechanisms that underlie the changes we saw in FFA composition as 
a result of a ADF-HF or ADF-LF diet. Another limitation of this 
study was that both intervention groups lost weight during the 
weight maintenance period. However, there were no between group 
differences in weight changes. It is conceivable that decreases in 
weight during the weight maintenance period diluted observable 
decreases in FFA concentrations during the weight loss that followed. </p>

<p>
As we observed significant changes in FFA concentrations during the 
weight loss period, the effect of the initial weight lost during the 
weight maintenance period on FFA concentrations was likely to be 
minimal. 
In summary, our findings are the first to demonstrate that a weight 
loss intervention with ADF-HF or ADF-LF can reduce total and 
individual plasma FFA concentrations though it appears that a LF 
diet may be more effective at lowering FFA. Though both diets 
equally reduced waist circumference, we found several strong corre-
lations between WC and changes in individual FFAs in the ADF-HF 
group that were not present in the ADF-LF group. Since there were 
no differences in changes in FFA composition between groups, the 
correlations between WC and FFAs found only in the ADF-HF 
group imply that ADF-HF and ADF-LF diets may lower FFA con-
centrations through different mechanisms. Overall, the decreases in 
FFA concentrations after ADF weight loss may be cardio-protective. 
Future studies might include individual FFA profiles when evalu-
ating macronutrient composition, as the effects of specific FFAs in 
this context are not well known. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Subjects. Participants were recruited from the Chicago area and were randomized by 
stratified random sampling based on BMI and age. Subjects were then randomized to 
a ADF-HF or ADF-LF group, as previously described 
35 . Briefly, potential participants 
were eligible if they were female, 25 to 65 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) </p>

<p>between 30 and 39.9 kg/m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>. Participants had to be weight stable for 3 months prior to 
the beginning of the study, sedentary or lightly active, non-smokers, non-diabetic, 
and not taking any medications. Postmenopausal women were included provided 
they maintained a stable dose of their current hormone replacement therapy. All 
volunteers provided written informed consent. All study protocols were carried our in 
accordance with guidelines approved by the Office for the Protection of Research 
Subjects at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, USA and the Human 
Research Ethics Committee at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada. </p>

<p>Diet. Food provided was prepared in the metabolic kitchen of the Human Nutrition 
Research Unit at the University of Illinois, Chicago. All subjects underwent a 2-week 
high fat or low fat weight maintenance period (week 1-2), followed by an 8-week ADF 
weight-loss diet (week 3-10). The ADF-HF group received 45% fat (14% saturated fat, 
20% monounsaturated fat, 11% polyunsaturated fat) and the ADF-LF group 
received 25% fat (6% saturated fat, 13% monounsaturated, 6% polyunsaturated 
fat). A detailed description of the diet composition and energy requirements is 
provided elsewhere 
35 . Subjects were provided with 3 meals on each feed day and 
one meal on each fast day. All subjects were asked to consume their meals at the 
same time each day. </p>

<p>Weight loss and body composition. Body weight measurements were taken weekly 
following an overnight fast (to the nearest 0.5 kg) in light clothing and without shoes 
using a balance beam scale (HealthOMeter; Sunbeam Products, Boca Raton, FL). 
Height was measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer (to the nearest 0.1 cm). BMI 
was assessed as kg/m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>. Total fat mass and fat-free mass was determined by dual energy 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (QDR 4500 W, Hologic Inc. Arlington, MA) at baseline, 
week 3 and week 10. Waist circumference was taken by a flexible measuring tape (to the 
nearest 0.1 cm), midway between the lower costal margin and super iliac crest during a 
period of expiration. Participants wore a pedometer (Digi-Walker SW-200, Yamax 
Corp., Japan) during the study to ensure maintenance of regular physical activity habits. </p>

Plasma lipid and free fatty acid analysis. Blood samples were collected in the 
morning after an overnight fast at baseline, week 3 and week 10. Exercise, alcohol, and 
coffee were restricted for 24 h before each visit. Blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 
520 G in 4uC and plasma was stored at 280uC until analyzed. Plasma lipid samples 
were analysed as previously described 
35 . FFA were quantified via ultra performance 
liquid chromatography (UPLC) (Waters ACUITY UPLC, Milford, Massachusetts). 
a-linolenate (LNA), docosahexanoate (DHA), arachadonate (AA), and linoleate (LA) 
standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Myristate (MA), palmitate (PA) and 
oleate (OA) standards were purchased from Nu-Check prep. All standards were 
.99% pure. FFA standards were dissolved in 4% fatty acid free albumin phosphate 
buffer. The individual standard solutions were combined to form an external mixed 
FFA standard. D31 palmitate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury, 
Massachusetts) was used as an internal standard and added to plasma samples and 
external standards. Plasma samples and the mixed FFA standards were extracted and 
derivatized as previously described 
36 . Samples were then transferred to a UPLC vial in 
20580 H2O:acetonitrile solution and 10 mL were injected onto a 55uC heated Acquity 
UPLC BEH C18 1.7 mM 2.1 3 150 mm column eluted with H2O:acetonitrile 20580 
at a mL/min rate. Peaks were detected with a photodiode array (PDA) detector at 
242 nm. </p>

<p>Statistical methods. All data was analyzed using SPSS software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 20.0</rs>, SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, IL). Results are presented as mean 6 SEM. Normality was assessed by 
Shapiro-Wilks tests. Independent samples t-tests were used to test baseline 
differences between groups. Repeated-measures ANOVA were used to assess for 
significant differences with time as the within-subject factor and diet as the between-
subject factor. Post-hoc analyses were done using a Tukey's test. Pearson correlations 
were performed to assess the relationships between body composition and FFA 
concentrations. Differences were considered significant at P , 0.05. </p>
