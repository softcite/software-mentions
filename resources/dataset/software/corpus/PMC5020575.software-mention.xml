<p>Background and Objectives: To analyze the clinical correlation between perverted nystag-
mus and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormal findings and to evaluate wheth-
er perverted nystagmus is clinically significant results of brain abnormal lesions or not. Sub-
jects and Methods: We performed medical charts review from January 2008 to July 2014, 
retrospectively. Patients who were suspected central originated vertigo at Frenzel goggles 
test were included among patients who visited our hospital. To investigate the correlation 
with nystagmus suspected central originated vertigo and brain MRI abnormal findings, we 
confirmed whether performing brain MRI or not. Then we exclude that patients not per-
formed brain MRI. Results: The number of patients with perverted nystagmus was 15, up-
beating was 1 and down-beating was 14. Among these patients, 5 patients have brain MRI 
abnormal findings. However, 2 patients with MRI abnormal findings were not associated 
correctly with perverted nystagmus and only 3 patients with perverted nystagmus were con-
sidered central originated vertigo and further evaluation and treatment was performed by 
the department of neurology. Conclusions: Perverted nystagmus was considered to the 
abnormalities at brain lesions, especially cerebellum, but neurologic symptoms and further 
evaluation were needed for exact diagnosis of central originated vertigo.

<p>Clinical Correlation between Nystagmus and MRI </p>

<p>and downbeat nystagmus, so far the pathophysiology of the 
disorders has not been clarified. We studied our investigation 
to evaluate the association between the presence of perverted 
nystagmus and brain imaging work up. </p>

<p>Subjects and Methods </p>

<p>We retrospectively reviewed medical records from January 
2008 to July 2014 to identify patients who complained feel-
ing dizziness, and we selected patients suspected central ver-
tigo at video Frenzel goggles test (perverted nystagmus, os-
cillopsia, etc.) in the department of otorhinolaryngology-
head and neck surgery at Korea University Ansan Hospital. 
To exactly evaluate causes of dizziness and rule out central 
originated vertigo, we strongly recommended the patients to 
take the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Almost all 
patients took the brain MRI when their symptoms were oc-
curred within 2 weeks (mean interval: 7.8±4.3 days), except 
3 patients. To investigate the correlation with eye movement 
suspected central originated vertigo at Frenzel goggles test 
and brain MRI abnormal findings, we confined whether per-
forming brain MRI or not. We selected 31 patients and eval-
uated nystagmus and brain MRI findings. In addition, we re-
viewed 5 patients who were diagnosed brain infarction, 
hemorrhage, and multiple sclerosis at department of neurolo-
gy before visiting our department. </p>

<p>Patients 
A total of 34 patients participated in this study. Among 
these patients, we selected 31 patients because 3 cases had 
no brain MRI records. The patients included 18 women and 
13 men who ranged in age from 19 to 82 years (mean±stan-
dard deviation=53.1±15.5). At the first and follow-up visit 
for evaluating dizziness, all of the patients underwent Frenzel 
goggles test for identifying head-shaking and positional nys-
tagmus. Furthermore, the presence of dysarthria, general 
weakness, gait ataxia was examined by patients' interview 
and several physical examination. </p>

<p>Frenzel goggles test 
Patients were asked to sit upright with their eyes opened 
comfortably, spontaneous nystagmus and gaze nystagmus 
was measured. Positioning nystagmus was induced by the 
Dix-Hallpike and straight head-hanging maneuvers. At each 
position, the patients were instructed not to close their eyes. 
During measuring head shaking nystagmus, patient's eyes 
closed and their head tilted forward about 30 degrees to bring 
the horizontal semicircular canals into the plane of stimula-
tion. The head was shaken horizontally by an examiner in a </p>

<p>sinusoidal manner at a rate of 2.5 Hz with an amplitude of 10 
degrees for 10s. After the head-shaking, the patients were in-
structed to open their eyes and look straight ahead. Eye move-
ments were recorded with an infrared camera (resolution of 
640×480 pixels, frame rate of 60 Hz) and displayed on a com-
puter monitor (SLMED, Seoul, Korea). The nystagmus was 
analyzed by otologist at the department of otorhinolaryngolo-
gy-head and neck surgery at Korea University Ansan Hospital. </p>

<p>Brain MRI 
Thirty-one out of the 34 cases had brain MRI records. 
Three cases refused brain MRI because of low social eco-
nomic status or no time to perform brain MRI due to their 
own schedule. In this study, brain MRI include brain MRI-
diffusion, brain MRI, brain MRI-magnetic resonance angiog-
raphy (MRA), and brain MRI-internal auditory canal (MRI-
IAC). Brain MRI-diffusion is a commonly performed MRI 
sequence for evaluation of acute ischemic stroke, and is sen-
sitive in detection of small and early infarcts. Brain MRI is 
also sensitive in detection of infarcts and can more exact as-
sessment about pathologic lesions. MRA generates pictures 
of the arteries or aneurysms for evaluating abnormal narrow-
ing or vessel wall dilatations. In this study, brain MRI-MRA 
means that brain MRI was performed with brain MRA, and 
brain MRI-IAC means the brain MRI focused on posterior 
fossa area. Seventeen cases performed brain MRI-diffusion, 
4 cases performed brain MRI, 15 performed brain MRI-
MRA, and 2 performed brain MRI-IAC. In these cases, 4 
cases performed brain MRI-diffusion with brain MRI-MRA, 
1 case performed brain MRI-diffusion with brain MRI-IAC, 
and 1 case performed brain MRI-diffusion, brain MRI-MRA, 
and brain MRI-IAC. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
We analyzed comparisons of the occurrences of perverted 
nystagmus and of brain MRI abnormal findings and odds ra-
tio of several factors about occurring perverted nystagmus. 
The statistical analyses were conducted using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> soft-
ware (version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">22.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA), p&lt;0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. This study was reviewed 
and approved by the Korea University Ansan Hospital Insti-
tutional Review Board (AS15068). </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>There were 31 patients (male is 13, female is 18) and mean 
age of patients was 53.1±15.5 years old. We exclude 3 pa-
tients, total number of cases is 31. The number of patients with 
perverted nystagmus is 15, up-beating is 1 and down-beating </p>

<p>Han WG, et al. </p>

<p>is 14 (Table 1). 
Among these patients, 5 patients have Brain MRI abnor-
mal findings. However, 2 MRI abnormal findings (patient 
No. 14, 15) were not associated correctly with perverted nys-
tagmus. 3 patients with perverted nystagmus (patient No. 11, 
12, 13) were considered central originated vertigo and fur-
ther evaluation and treatment was performed by department 
of neurology (Fig. 1). In No. 11 patient, although the reading 
of brain MRI was old infarction, we treated anti-coagulant 
therapy in accordance with the acute left cerebellar infarction 
after the consultation of department of neurology. The reason </p>

<p>was that her symptoms onset was 1 week ago and we didn't 
rule out the progression of old infarction. Despite the brain 
MRI-diffusion reading of No. 13 patient was old lacunar in-
farction at left cerebellum, we consulted to department of neu-
rology and didn't rule out acute infarction because perverted 
nystagmus was persisted, dizziness was not improved, and 
acute lacunar infarction could be seen low signal intensity at 
brain MRI-diffusion. Unfortunately, No. 13 patient refused 
further work up and re-admitted at our department of neurol-
ogy due to left mid brain and both cerebellar infarction with 
vertebral artery stenosis after 5 months. </p>

<p>Fig. 1. Analysis of patients. We ana-
lyzed total 34 patients initially. Among 
34 patients, 3 patients were exclud-
ed because they had no brain MRI 
records. Among 31 selected patients, 
15 patients were shown perverted 
nystagmus at Freznel goggles test, 
1 patient had up-beating nystagmus 
and 14 patients had down-beating 
nystagmus. Among 14 patients with 
down-beating nystagmus, 5 patients 
were shown abnormal findings at 
brain MRI records and 3 patients' ab-
normal findings at brain MRI were 
considered central lesion associat-
ed dizziness and nystagmus. </p>



<p>Clinical Correlation between Nystagmus and MRI </p>

<p>Among 15 patients who had spontaneous perverted nys-
tagmus or perverted nystagmus at headshaking, we consid-
ered 3 patients with central lesions. And we investigated fur-
ther evaluation for the remaining 12 people to find out the 
causes of nystagmus using pure tone audiometry, speech au-
diometry, caloric test, saccade test, optokinetic nystagmus 
test, target with tracking inspection, rotatory chair test, vestib-
ular (VEMP) evoked myogenic potential, electrocochleogra-
phy, and auditory brainstem response. Six cases did not un-
dergo the examination, 3 cases thought to be dysfunction of 
the vestibular nerve like vestibular neuritis, 2 cases were sus-
pected BPPV, and one case was observed continuing up-beat-
ing nystagmus, exact diagnosis was not made. 
Furthermore, 5 patients who were diagnosed brain infarc-
tion, hemorrhage (especially cerebellar lesion), and multiple 
sclerosis at department of neurology before visiting our de-
partment were shown no abnormal nystagmus or abnormal 
nystagmus and eye movement at video Frenzel goggles test, 
not shown perverted nystagmus (Table 2). 
We also divided 31 patients into two groups. One group 
was composed of 15 patients with perverted nystagmus and 
the other group was composed of 16 patients without visual-
ized perverted nystagmus. We verified the correlation be-
tween perverted nystagmus and hypertension (HTN), diabe-
tes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) history in 
groups using statistical methods. Odds ratio at perverted nys-
tagmus with HTN estimated 2.889, this value was not statis-
tically significant (p value=0.252). In addition, odds ratio at 
perverted nystagmus with DM estimated 3.500 (p value= 
0.220), and odds ratio at perverted nystagmus with CVA his-
tory estimated 0.310 (p value=0.600), there were no statisti-
cally significant (Table 3). </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>In the present study, one-third (5/15) of patients showing 
perverted nystagmus have abnormal findings at brain imag-
ing. In these patients, except 2 patients (possible calcification 
at right globus pallidus and suspicious mild focal stenosis at </p>

<p>left middle cerebral artery), brain MRI abnormal findings 
were correlated with perverted nystagmus. 
It was reported that 9 patients (50%) at among 18 patients 
with anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction showed pat-
terns of head-shaking nystagmus that included perverted nys-
tagmus (n=7), head-shaking nystagmus in the opposite direc-
tion of spontaneous nystagmus (n=4), and head-shaking 
nystagmus beating towards unilateral canal paresis or abnor-
mal head impulse testing (n=3) [12]. 
Furthermore, in another study, it was investigated sponta-
neous nystagmus and head-shaking nystagmus in 72 patients 
with isolated cerebellar infarction. Twenty eight patients had 
spontaneous nystagmus, 37 patients had head-shaking nys-
tagmus including perverted nystagmus and horizontal nystag-
mus. Authors suggested that, perverted head-shaking nystag-
mus occurred in 23 patients and 22 was downbeat nystagmus 
[13]. 
In addition, it was examined 32 cases who were subjected 
with a perverted nystagmus. Twenty four subjects had a cen-
tral disease and 8 subjects had a vestibular neuritis. Authors 
advocated that although the perverted nystagmus was a sim-
ple examination sign, it was important because this sign was 
thought to be the brain stem abnormalities [14]. 
In some studies, only 11% of isolated cerebellar infracted 
patients were shown isolated vertigo, nystagmus, and postur-
al unsteadiness that were similar to acute peripheral vestibu-
lar disorders in other study [15-17]. Eight patients with iso-
lated cerebellar focal infarction all presented with vertigo 
sensation and severe imbalance. They accentuated severe 
imbalance and a negative head impulse test were important 
factors for distinguishing focal infarction from peripheral </p>

<p>vestibular dysfunction [18]. As above, for accurate diagnose 
cerebellar focal infarct, further study correlation like bither-
mal caloric tests, cervical and ocular VEMPs, and brain MRI 
was needed [15]. 
In the current study, 10 patients with perverted nystagmus 
had no abnormal findings in brain MRI. Among these patients, 
3 patients took the brain MRI-diffusion only. Since the accura-
cy of brain MRI-diffusion is lower than that of brain MRI-
MRA or other MRI settings, we could have gained more accu-
rate result if we carried out additional brain imaging work up. 
We also examined 5 patients who were diagnosed brain 
infarction, hemorrhage, and multiple sclerosis etc., they had 
no perverted nystagmus at Frenzel goggle test. Three patients 
had no abnormal eye movements, 2 patients had abnormal eye 
movements and neurologic symptoms were observed. At this 
evaluation, we did not consider the duration between time of 
diagnosis of infarction and onset of symptoms, this factor af-
fected results of nystagmus finding. 
We examined the correlation between HTN, DM, CVA 
history and perverted nystagmus, however, there was no sta-
tistically significant. In general, perverted nystagmus was in-
duced by cerebellar infarction, and cerebellum is supplied by 
basilar artery [7]. In fact, we should have been examined oth-
er risk factors which can cause perverted nystagmus such as 
angina pectoris, arrhythmia, or history of acute myocardial 
infarction, etc. However, we couldn't acquire enough informa-
tion about exact medical history through retrospective chart 
review in this study. 
In another study, it was studied 25 patients (9 men and 16 
women) with clinical findings compatible with two or more 
infarcts in the vertebro-basilar territory. The risk factors of 
vertebra-basilar infarction were HTN (64%), CVA (28%), 
smoking history (28%), DM (24%) and atrial fibrillation (20%) 
[19]. 
Although perverted nystagmus is known as an indicator of 
the central lesions, results of our study were not ideal results 
compared with previous other studies. First, we studied too 
small group for evaluating the correlation between perverted 
nystagmus and central lesions. Second, we did not considered 
time of onset of symptoms and time of diagnosis at brain 
ischemic stroke strictly. In this reason, we missed the period 
of appearing perverted nystagmus at patients with cerebellar 
vascular abnormalities. In order to further study, we needed 
greater number of patients and more exact classification criteria. 
In our study, three of 15 patients showing perverted nys-
tagmus have abnormal findings at brain imaging correlated 
dizziness and perverted nystagmus. As above, only perverted </p>

<p>nystagmus does not mean exactly being of abnormal lesions 
of brain. In conclusion, perverted nystagmus was considered 
to the abnormalities at brain lesions, especially cerebellum, 
but neurologic symptoms and further evaluation were needed 
for exact diagnosis of central originated vertigo. </p>
