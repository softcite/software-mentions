<p>Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements are high-order RNA structures 
that promote internal initiation of translation to allow protein synthesis 
under situations that compromise the general cap-dependent translation 
mechanism. Picornavirus IRES elements are highly efficient elements with a 
modular RNA structure organization. Here we investigated the effect of 
Mg 
2+ concentration on the local flexibility and solvent accessibility of the 
foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES element measured on the basis 
of selective 2 
0 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) 
reactivity and hydroxyl radical cleavage. We have found that Mg 
2+ concen-
tration affects the organization of discrete IRES regions, mainly the apical 
region of domain 3, the 10 nt loop of domain 4, and the pyrimidine tract of 
domain 5. In support of the effect of RNA structure on IRES activity, sub-
stitution or deletion mutants of the 10 nt loop of domain 4 impair internal 
initiation. In addition, divalent cations affect the binding of eIF4G, a 
eukaryotic initiation factor that is essential for IRES-dependent translation 
that interacts with domain 4. Binding of eIF4G is favored by the local RNA 
flexibility adopted at low Mg 
2+ concentration, while eIF4B interacts with 
the IRES independently of the compactness of the RNA structure. Our 
study shows that the IRES element adopts a near-native structure in the 
absence of proteins, shedding light on the influence of Mg 
2+ ions on the 
local flexibility and binding of eIF4G in a model IRES element. </p>

<p>RNA structure plays a fundamental role in biological 
processes guided by RNA regulatory elements [1,2]. As 
for most RNA regulatory elements, the RNA structure 
dictates the function of the internal ribosome entry site 
(IRES) [3-5]. IRES elements, which were discovered in 
picornavirus genomic RNAs, are in charge of driving 
translation initiation in various RNA viruses and a sub-
set of cellular mRNAs [6-8]. Indeed, IRES-driven trans-
lation initiation represents an alternative mechanism to </p>

<p>start protein synthesis under situations that compromise 
cap-dependent translation initiation, typically occurring 
in infected cells. However, under normal situations, 
most eukaryotic mRNAs initiate translation by a mech-
anism that depends on recognition of the m 
7 GpppN 
residue (termed the cap) located at the 5 
0 end of most 
mRNAs [9]. 
IRES elements exhibit a wide diversity of nucleotide 
sequences, RNA secondary structures and trans-acting </p>

<p>factor requirements, as illustrated by the IRES ele-
ments present in the genome of picornaviruses, the in-
tergenic region of dicistroviruses and hepatitis C virus 
[10]. Earlier studies of the IRES element of foot-and-
mouth-disease virus (FMDV), a member of the Picor-
naviridae family, revealed a modular organization of 
domains, termed 1-5 in the 5 
0 ?3 
0 direction [11]. These 
RNA domains contain specific structural motifs that 
are responsible for recruitment of eIFs (eIF4G, eIF4B 
and eIF3) and several IRES-binding factors [12-16]. 
We have recently used selective 2 
0 -hydroxyl acylation 
analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) to assess the 
RNA structure of IRES elements [3,17]. This method-
ology has the advantage over other high-resolution 
approaches of allowing analysis of long RNA mole-
cules and providing information at single-nucleotide 
resolution [18]. Our studies have shown that domain 3 
is a self-folding region that harbors conserved motifs 
whose disruption impairs IRES activity. These motifs 
have been proposed to be involved in distant interac-
tions on the basis that altering one of them affects the 
RNA structural organization of this domain, leading to 
defective IRES elements [19-21]. However, three-
dimensional models of the picornavirus IRES RNA 
structure are not yet available. Although a high Mg </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>concentration inactivated the IRES-dependent activity 
in cell-free lysates of the closely related encephalomyo-
carditis virus [22], the influence of divalent cations on 
the IRES structure, and, in particular, whether the con-
centration of Mg 
2+ ions affects the binding of factors 
needed for IRES activity, are unknown. 
Adoption of RNA tertiary structure is strongly 
dependent on Mg 
2+ ions, although a mixture of mono-
valent cations (K 
+ and Na </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>) with Mg 
2+ is required 
for efficient folding [23,24]. In the case of the FMDV 
IRES, long-distance RNA-RNA interactions were 
dependent on the concentration of the divalent ion in 
the folding buffer [19,25]. Cations reduce the charge 
repulsion generated by phosphate anions of the back-
bone, stabilizing the folded conformation of RNA [26]. 
It is well established that Mg </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>, which has a high 
charge density, is the dominant divalent cation in bio-
logical systems [24]. Moreover, Mg 
2+ ions perform 
both catalytic and structural roles, including mediation 
of helical packaging, promotion of long-range interac-
tions, and stabilization of RNA motifs [27]. 
In this study, we investigated the effect of Mg </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>concentration on the local flexibility and solvent 
accessibility of the IRES RNA measured by SHAPE 
reactivity and hydroxyl radical cleavage. We show that 
Mg 
2+ concentration affects the organization of dis-
crete regions located in the apical region of domain 3, 
the 10 nt loop of domain 4, and the pyrimidine tract </p>

<p>of domain 5. Based on these results, we analyzed the 
effect of divalent cations on the binding of eIF4G 
and eIF4B, two initiation factors that are involved in 
FMDV IRES-dependent translation [12,28]. We have 
found that eIF4B interacts with the IRES indepen-
dently of the rigidity of the RNA structure, while 
binding of eIF4G is favored by RNA flexibility in 
this region. Collectively, this study provides new 
insights into the influence of Mg 
2+ ions on the local 
flexibility and protein binding of a picornavirus IRES, 
shedding light on the structure of a model IRES 
element. </p>

<p>This study was designed to investigate the conformation 
of the IRES element under various ionic conditions. To 
this end, in vitro-synthesized RNA containing the func-
tional FMDV IRES (nucleotides 1-462) upstream of the 
luciferase coding region (Fig. 1A) was denatured, snap-
cooled, and renatured in folding buffer under a range of 
MgCl 2 concentrations, keeping the buffer concentration 
(HEPES pH 8, 100 mM) and monovalent cation concen-
trations (NaCl, 100 mM; KCl, 140 mM) constant. This 
procedure was followed to minimize intermolecular 
interactions, release mis-folded molecules from kinetic 
traps and promote the most stable secondary structure. 
Refolded RNA was treated with N-methylisatoic anhy-
dride (NMIA), which preferentially acylates the 2 
0 -OH 
of riboses associated with conformational flexible nucle-
otides [29]. Heavily modified positions correspond to 
nucleotides that are primarily single-stranded, while 
non-reactive nucleotides are involved in base pairs. 
Inflexible regions may also correspond to non-WC base 
pairs, tertiary interactions, or a single stacking interac-
tion in the C2 
0 -endo conformation [30,31]. After NMIA 
treatment, the IRES region was examined by reverse 
transcriptase extension using primers spaced along the 
RNA sequence to obtain overlapping readings [3]. Then, 
cDNA products derived from the untreated and NMIA-
treated RNAs were resolved in denaturing acrylamide 
urea gels in parallel with a sequence ladder obtained 
using the same primer (Fig. 1B). Gross modifications of 
SHAPE reactivity where observed in specific regions of 
domains 3 and 4 of the IRES folded at low Mg 
2+ con-
centration (0.5 mM) compared with RNA folded at high 
Mg 
2+ concentration (6 mM). Compared with the 
absence of Mg 
2+ in the folding buffer, the apical region 
of domain 3 showed a decreased SHAPE reactivity in 
residues 200-202 in the presence of 0.5 and 6 mM Mg </p>

changes in the IRES structure affecting several nucleo-
tides under low and high Mg

(Fig. 2B,C) were located in three regions (boxes I, II

(199-202) (corresponding to the RAAA motif on the 
apical stem-loop of domain 3) exhibited a decrease in 
reactivity upon Mg 
2+ addition (box I in Fig. 2A-C).

AACUCC(166-171) and CGCCCACACG(207-216), 
as well as the C-rich loop UGCAACCCCAGCAC 
(230-243). On the other hand, nucleotides GUA-
ACACGCGAC(337-348) corresponding to the 10 nt 
loop of domain 4 (box II in Fig. 2A-C) showed a sig-
nificant decrease in reactivity under high Mg 
2+ con-
centration. Reactivity changes affecting more than one 
position were also observed at positions UUUCCU 
(440-445), corresponding to the pyrimidine-rich tract 
of domain 5 (box III in Fig. 2A-C). Some changes of 
reactivity were also observed at individual residues 
(A361 and G389). 
Independent measurements of the local RNA flexibil-
ity were performed using fluorescent primers and capil-
lary electrophoresis (Fig. 3A). The results displayed on 
the IRES secondary structure (Fig. 3B) are largely coin-
cident with those obtained using radiolabeled primers, </p>

<p>in agreement with previous studies [32]. In fact, only 
minor differences were observed in some positions, 
which may be due to the different methodology neces-
sary to quantify the reverse transcriptase stop signals.

2+ concentration

<p>, 
the predominant monovalent cation in the cell cyto-
plasm, indicated that the main change occurred at 
around 2 mM Mg 
2+ (Fig. 4A). Very few differences 
were found in individual positions, and these did not 
modify the overall pattern of SHAPE reactivity at the 
same Mg 
2+ concentration irrespective of the presence 
of Na 
+ or K 
+ ions (compare Fig. 4B,C with Fig. 2B, 
C). We therefore used 0.5 and 6 mM as the low and 
high concentrations of Mg 
2+ for further studies on 
IRES structure. 
Thus, we conclude that the Mg 
2+ concentration 
profoundly affects the organization of discrete IRES </p>

<p>Mutational analysis reveals involvement of the 
10 nt loop of domain 4 in IRES activity </p>

<p>Regarding the involvement in IRES function of the 
regions showing changes in local flexibility upon 
Mg 
2+ increase, previous data from our laboratory 
have shown that the apical loop of domain 3 is 
involved in IRES activity, and its sequence composi-
tion affects the RNA structure of the flanking 
stem-loops [3,20,33]. However, no information was 
available regarding the 10 nt loop of domain 4. 
Alignment of the IRES sequences from 180 FMDV 
isolates available in GenBank indicated that the 
sequence of the 10 nt loop at nucleotides 337-348 is 
conserved, with the exception of C343 and C345, 
which tolerated transitions and transversions (A or </p>

<p>U and U or G, respectively) (Fig. 5A). Occasional 
substitutions were observed at positions U338 and 
A347. Indeed, a conserved motif GUAACANGN-
GAC(337-348) was inferred from sequence conserva-
tion. In contrast, flanking nucleotides that are 
engaged in base pairs according to SHAPE probing 
(Fig. 2A) were either invariant or covariant 
(Fig. 5A). 
Thus, to obtain information about the implication 
of the 10 nt loop at nucleotides 337-348 on IRES 
activity, we generated two mutants. The first one 
(D338-347) carried a deletion of the entire loop, and 
the second one (A339C/A340G) carried a double sub-
stitution that was intended to close the loop (Fig. 5B). 
Determination of the efficiency of internal initiation of 
translation of these mutants relative to the wild-type 
IRES showed a decrease of activity of approximately 
80% (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that the 10 nt 
loop of domain 4 contributes to IRES activity to a 
significant extent. </p>

Effect of Mg

<p>Assembly of eIF4G-IRES and eIF4B-IRES

residues in domains 4 and 5 </p>

<p>The IRES domains 4 and 5, which showed important 
changes in RNA structure upon folding at high concen-
tration of Mg </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>, provide the binding sites for eIF4G 
and eIF4B during internal initiation [6]. Thus, we ana-
lyzed the influence of Mg 
2+ on the IRES-protein inter-
action on the basis of the SHAPE footprint, a 
methodology that allows the study of RNA molecules 
assembled in ribonucleoprotein complexes [18,34]. In 
this assay, the protections correspond to RNA regions </p>

<p>involved RNA-protein interactions or changes in 
RNA conformation induced by the RNA-protein inter-
action. 
To determine the effect of Mg 
2+ ions on the interac-
tion of eIF4G with the IRES, RNA folded at 0.5 mM 
Mg 
2+ was incubated with increasing amounts of puri-
fied His-tagged eIF4G protein (0, 40 and 80 nM) prior 
to NMIA treatment. Primer extension analysis of the 
complexes assembled in vitro allowed measurement of 
the SHAPE reactivity of the IRES region in RNA 
incubated with or without eIF4G (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-4).

<p>Effect of Mg 
2+ on IRES structure and eIF4G-binding 
G. Lozano et al. </p>

<p>RNA, eIF4G protein induces the protection of 
sequences that lie within domain 4 of the IRES. Spe-
cifically, nucleotides 400-418 were protected from 
NMIA attack upon addition of His-tagged eIF4G at 
low Mg 
2+ concentration (blue bar/box in Fig. 6A,B). 
These results are in agreement with independent 
approaches, such as assembly of 48S pre-initiation 
complexes and RNA-protein pull-down and UV-cross-
link assays performed using a range of Mg 
2+ concen-
trations between 0.3 and 2.5 mM, which mapped 
the binding site of eIF4G to domain 4 of the encepha-
lomyocarditis virus and FMDV IRES elements [16,35-
38]. In addition, nucleotides 340-350 were reorganized 
upon addition of the protein, with noticeable changes 
in the primer extension pattern (Fig. 6A,B, blue bar/ 
box). However, residues 75, 293-303 and 447-454 were 
more reactive towards NMIA (Fig. 6B, red boxes), 
indicating modified organization of the regions flank-
ing the protein-binding site on the IRES structure. 
Reactivity changes around position 380 were observed 
independently of the RNA treatment. Additionally, 
nucleotides 53-66 within domain 2 were protected 
(Fig. 6B, blue box). However, none of the eIF4G-
induced protections observed at low Mg 
2+ concentra-
tion were detected for RNA folded at high Mg </p>

<p>concentration (Fig. 6C). These results led us to con-
clude that eIF4G-IRES interaction is sensitive to the 
RNA structure reorganization induced by divalent 
cations. 
The RNA-binding protein eIF4B interacts with 
picornavirus IRES elements, stimulating IRES activity 
[12,39]. Interaction of eIF4B with the IRES element 
was first analyzed using RNA folded at 6 mM Mg </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>incubated with increasing amounts of purified His-
tagged eIF4B protein (0, 60, 300 and 500 nM). Of 
interest, a concentration of 300 nM (lane 4 in Fig. 7A) 
was sufficient to induce protection of residues belong-
ing to domain 5, although the protection increased 
with protein concentration (blue bar in Fig. 7A). How-
ever, some nucleotides near the 3 
0 boundary of the 
IRES were more reactive in the presence of eIF4B (red 
bar in Fig. 7A). 
Next, the SHAPE reactivity values observed on free 
RNA at both 0.5 and 6 mM Mg 
2+ were compared 
with those obtained upon addition of eIF4B. Interest-
ingly, the hairpin of domain 5 (nucleotides 416-433) 
was protected by eIF4B from NMIA attack at both 
low and high Mg 
2+ concentrations (blue boxes in 
Fig. 7B,C). In contrast, two short regions spanning 
nucleotides 293-297 (domain 3) and 447-454 </p>

<p>(domain 5) became more reactive towards NMIA (red 
boxes in Fig. 7B,C). Residues belonging to domain 3 
showed no gross changes in SHAPE reactivity with 
the exception of positions 179-180, while nucleotides 
53-66 within domain 2 were protected. These results 
show that eIF4B specifically induces protection of resi-
dues belonging to domains 2 and 5. 
It is worth mentioning that specific residues were 
differentially protected upon incubation of the IRES 
with eIF4G or eIF4B at low Mg 
2+ concentration 
(Fig. 8). For instance, while eIF4G-IRES complexes 
protect residues within domain 4 (blue-shaded nucleo-
tides in Fig. 8A), complexes assembled with eIF4B 
preferentially protect the hairpin of domain 5 (blue-
shaded nucleotides in Fig. 8B). However, in both 
cases, a reorganization of flanking sequences within 
the pyrimidine-rich region of domain 5 and the basal </p>

<p>region of domain 3 (red-shaded nucleotides in 
Fig. 8A,B) was observed, suggesting that these residues 
are in close proximity in the three-dimensional struc-
ture of the IRES. </p>

<p>, the hairpin of domain 5 
became solvent-inaccessible (Fig. 9B, gray nucleotides) 
indicating burial of this region due to structural com-
paction. Concomitantly, a change in accessibility to 
the solvent for residues within the 10 nt loop of 
domain 4 was observed (Fig. 9B, compare gray and 
purple nucleotides in left and right panels). Thus, the 
basal region of domain 4 and most of domain 5 
remain solvent-inaccessible at high Mg 
2+ concentra-
tion. These results, together with those shown in 
Figs 4, 5 and 6, suggest that eIF4B interaction with 
the IRES is independent of the compactness of the 
IRES structure, while binding of eIF4G is favored by 
RNA flexibility in this region, probably provided by a 
solvent-accessible hairpin of domain 5. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>In this study, we show that the FMDV IRES structure 
is modulated by the concentration of Mg 
2+ ions. </p>

<p>Using SHAPE methodology, we identified three dis-
crete regions where the RNA structure is dependent 
on the cation concentration. Furthermore, the confor-
mational changes induced by Mg 
2+ concentration dif-
ferentially affected the binding of two host factors: 
eIF4G and eIF4B. Interestingly, the IRES-eIF4G 
complex was sensitive to the conformational changes 
induced by Mg 
2+ ions. Indeed, at high Mg 
2+ concen-
trations of the ion, no footprinting was observed on 
the IRES RNA, but it was readily observed at low 
Mg 
2+ concentration. Conversely, interaction of eIF4B 
with the IRES was detected at both low and high con-
centrations of the ion, leading to a similar pattern of 
reactivity irrespective of the concentration of Mg 
2+ . 
The analysis of IRES-protein complexes revealed an 
increased reactivity in regions flanking eIF4G and 
eIF4B binding sites, indicating that assembly of these 
complexes generates secondary structure rearrange-
ments in regions adjacent to the protein-binding site. 
In recent years, RNA has received much attention, 
and has been shown to be a major player in many 
cellular processes. Many of the novel biological func-
tions identified depend on RNA structure. However,

<p>Effect of Mg 
2+ on IRES structure and eIF4G-binding 
G. Lozano et al. </p>

<p>molecules is hampered by the flexibility of RNA in 
solution and the relative low number of RNA three-
dimensional structures available so far [41]. SHAPE 
probing methodology has the advantage over other 
high-resolution approaches of allowing analysis of long 
RNA molecules in solution. In this regard, recent 
SHAPE structural studies have provided information 
on various RNA conformations, tertiary structures, 
long-distance 3 
0 ?5 
0 interactions and ribonucleoprotein 
complexes of RNA in solution [42-45]. 
Based on the results shown here by measuring 
SHAPE reactivity using either radiolabeled primers and 
conventional denaturing gels or fluorescent primers and 
capillary electrophoresis, the IRES element adopts a 
near-native conformation in the absence of proteins. In 
further support of these data, it is worth noting that the 
organization of the IRES in bulges and stems, as 
defined by the susceptibility towards NMIA attack 
under low (0.5 mM) Mg </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>, is in agreement with that 
defined previously on the basis of DMS, and RNases 
T1 or T2 attack using a buffer containing 1 mM Mg </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>[11]. Furthermore, all procedures used to probe the 
RNA structure of this IRES element indicated that the 
stem holding the apical region of domain 3 remains 
resistant to NMIA, DMS, and RNases T1 or T2 attack, 
and mutations that disrupt some of these base pairs led 
to defective IRES elements [46,47]. 
With regard to the changes induced by different 
Mg 
2+ concentrations on the local RNA flexibility of 
the apical region of domain 3, it is worth noting that 
this region harbors three conserved motifs (GNRA, 
RAAA and the C-rich loop). Disruption of these 
motifs or destabilization of the corresponding stems 
led to a defective IRES and induced changes in the 
RNA structure of this region [3,17,19,20,48]. The 
SHAPE reactivity changes observed upon Mg </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>increase in the folding buffer are consistent with a 
strong influence of the divalent cation on the structural 
organization of this RNA domain. 
As Mg 
2+ ions dictate RNA tertiary folding [26], a 
potential outcome of our work was identification of 
nucleotides involved in tertiary interactions within the 
IRES element. Attempts to identify positions involved 
in distant interactions made use of RNA structure pre-
diction programs that incorporate SHAPE reactivity 
data [49-51]. This was performed as an unbiased 
method to detect base pairs between nucleotides that 
resulted in modified reactivity upon Mg 
2+ incubation. 
However, no gross changes in stem-loop composition 
were detected irrespective of whether the full-length 
IRES, individual domains or combinations of its struc-
tural domains (4-5, 3-4-5 or 2-4-5) were used. This 
result shows that the secondary RNA structure is </p>

<p>stable even in the absence of Mg 
2+ , which, in turn, 
appears to indicate that Mg 
2+ contributes to tertiary 
interactions. 
Candidate nucleotides to form base pairs were also 
manually analyzed by pairwise comparison of the 
changes in reactivity and solvent accessibility. Attempts 
to identify candidate base pairs involving residues of 
the 10 nt loop of domain 4 did not detect a second site 
at which reactivity decreased to the same extent under 
high Mg 
2+ concentration. Given the difficulties of pre-
dicting non-canonical base pairs in the RNA structure, 
it is possible that residues involved in long-range inter-
actions were missed if either non-canonical base pairs 
or internal bulges were involved. Although we cannot 
rule out the possibility that a high Mg 
2+ concentration 
stabilizes intra-loop interactions [52,53], potential 
pairing of nucleotides GUAACACGCGAC(337-348) 
with positions CUCGGUUUA(390-398) was identi-
fied. Interestingly, this is partially coincident with the 
protection of residues UUUAAAAAAG(397-403) by 
eIF4G at 0.5 mM Mg 
2+ concentration but not at 6 mM. 
Thus, recognition of the eIF4G-binding site at low mM 
Mg 
2+ may be at least in part favored by a more flexible 
RNA structure due to lack of this putative tertiary 
interaction. 
The contribution of the 10 nt loop of domain 4 to 
IRES activity was analyzed in transfection assays 
using two mutants, consisting of a full deletion of the 
loop and a double mutant carrying the substitutions 
A339C and A340G (designed to base pair with C345 
and G346), mimicking the conformation observed at 
high Mg 
2+ concentration. Both mutants showed a 
reduction in internal initiation activity of approxi-
mately 80% relative to the wild-type IRES, suggesting 
that A339 and A340 perform critical roles in the con-
tribution of this loop to IRES activity. In support of 
these data, we have found that this particular region is 
reorganized upon addition of eIF4G, and that the 
eIF4G-IRES interaction is sensitive to the RNA struc-
ture reorganization induced by divalent cations. This 
result has important implications given that the con-
centration of Mg 
2+ in the cellular cytoplasm is 
approximately 0.5-1 mM [54]. Interestingly, although 
K 
+ is the predominant monovalent cation in the intra-
cellular environment, we found that Mg 
2+ concentra-
tion determines RNA structure irrespective of which 
monovalent ion (Na 
+ or K </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>) is used, in agreement 
with previous data [23]. Furthermore, the low RNA-
binding affinity of eIF4G [55] may explain the moder-
ate protection of eIF4G in the absence of other factors 
such as eIF4A, PTB and Ebp1 [16]. 
Because of the relevance of the IRES structural 
organization for picornavirus protein synthesis, we </p>

<p>compared the IRES solvent accessibility measured by 
hydroxyl cleavage with the inhibitory capacity of 2 
0 -O-
methyl oligoribonucleotides targeting the entire IRES 
region in mammalian cells [56]. Interestingly, while 
most oligoribonucleotides complementary to domain 4 
were non-inhibitory, those complementary to the 10 nt 
loop of domain 4 and the hairpin of domain 5 were 
inhibitory. This positive correlation exemplifies the 
importance of understanding RNA structure for 
rational development of small molecules with potential 
antiviral activity. 
Collectively, our results reveal the critical role of 
divalent cations for IRES structure, that, in turn, 
affects the interaction of the IRES with eIF4G, an 
essential factor for translation initiation driven by this 
IRES element. Future studies are necessary to dissect 
the implications of divalent cations on assembly of 
competent IRES-protein complexes in living cells. 
Additionally, as the FMDV IRES is a long, very effi-
cient element that may serve as model for RNA stud-
ies of complex IRES elements, understanding the 
principles controlling its RNA structure has potential 
implications for other ribonucleoprotein complexes 
controlling internal initiation of translation. </p>

Prior to in vitro transcription, plasmids were linearized 
using SphI. RNA synthesis was performed for 2 h at 37°C 
using T7 RNA polymerase [3] and the linearized DNA tem-

buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.3, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 75 mM KCl, 
8 mM dithiothreitol) and 1 lM of each dNTP. The mixture 
was heated at 52°C for 1 min prior to addition of 
100 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitro-

30 min. A sequencing ladder was generated using untreated 
RNA in the presence of 0.1 mM ddCTP. NED fluorophore 
(Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) was used for both 
NMIA-treated and untreated samples, while VIC fluoro-
phore (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) was used for 
the sequencing ladder. cDNA products were resolved by 
capillary electrophoresis.

room temperature. Then, RNA alone or RNA pre-incu-

<p>Fe(II)-EDTA was performed in parallel. After incubation at 
37°C for 30 s, reactions were quenched and precipitated by 
addition of 75% glycerol (one-third volume), 1 lL of

<p>EDTA and 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. RNAs were re-
suspended and reverse-transcribed. Primer extension reac-
tions were performed using fluorescent primers as described 
above for SHAPE reactivity. The NED fluorophore was 
used for both treated and untreated samples, while the VIC 
fluorophore was used for the sequencing ladder. cDNA 
products were resolved by capillary electrophoresis. </p>

<p>SHAPE reactivity and hydroxyl radical cleavage 
data analysis </p>

<p>Quantitative SHAPE reactivity for individual datasets 
obtained with radiolabeled primers was normalized to a 
scale spanning 0-1.5, in which 0 indicates unreactive nucle-
otides and the mean intensity at highly reactive nucleotides 
is set to 1.0 [3]. For each dataset, the intensity of the 
untreated RNA was subtracted from that of the treated 
RNA to obtain the net reactivity. Then, a normalization 
factor was determined by excluding the 2% most-reactive 
peak intensities, followed by calculating the mean for the 
next 8% of peak intensities. Reactivity values were then 
divided by this mean [58]. Data from at least three indepen-
dent assays were used to calculate the SHAPE reactivity 
(mean AE SD). 
SHAPE electropherograms were analyzed using <rs type="software">QUSHAPE</rs> 
software [59]. Quantitative SHAPE reactivities for individ-
ual datasets were normalized to a scale spanning 0-1.5, in 
which 0 indicates an unreactive nucleotide, and the mean 
intensity at highly reactive nucleotides is set to 1.0. 
Hydroxyl radical cleavage intensities were normalized to 
a scale from 0 to 1.5, where 1.0 is defined as the mean 
intensity of highly reactive residues. Nucleotides with reac-
tivity values lower than half the mean reactivity are defined 
as solvent-inaccessible [60]. </p>

<p>RNA structure analysis </p>

<p>The secondary RNA structure was visualized using <rs type="software">VAR-
NA</rs> [61]. <rs type="software">RNAsc</rs>, <rs type="software">RNAstructure</rs> and <rs type="software">SHAPEKNOTS</rs> software 
[49-51] were used to predict the secondary RNA structure 
including SHAPE reactivity values. </p>

<p>Nucleotide sequence analysis </p>

<p>Alignment of 180 FMDV IRES nucleotide sequences avail-
able in GenBank was performed using <rs id="software-13" type="software">CLUSTALX</rs> with default 
parameters (<rs corresp="#software-13" type="url">http://www.clustal.org</rs>). Polymorphic positions 
in the region 306-380 were determined relative to the FMDV 
C-S8 isolate (GenBank accession number AF274010.1). The 
sequence logo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu) was generated 
from alignment of the 180 IRES sequences. The overall </p>

<p>height of each stack indicates the sequence conservation at 
that position (measured in bits), and the height of symbols 
within the stack reflects the relative frequency of the corre-
sponding nucleic acid at that position. </p>

<p>Expression and purification of proteins </p>

<p>Escherichia coli BL21 was transformed with plasmids 
expressing His-tagged eIF4G [62] and His-tagged eIF4B 
[63], and grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37°C. Protein 
expression was induced using isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyr-
anoside for 2 h. Bacterial cell lysates were prepared in 
binding buffer (20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM 
imidazole), and cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation 
twice at 16 000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The lysate was loaded 
into His-GraviTrap columns (GE HealthCare, Little Chal-
font, UK), and the recombinant protein was eluted using 
500 mM imidazole. Proteins were dialyzed against phos-
phate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 
stored at À20°C in 50% glycerol. </p>

<p>IRES activity assays </p>

<p>Relative IRES activity was quantified as the expression in 
transfected BHK-21 cell monolayers of luciferase normal-
ized to that of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from bi-
cistronic mRNAs as described previously [47]. Experiments 
were performed in triplicate wells, and each experiment was 
repeated at least three times. </p>
