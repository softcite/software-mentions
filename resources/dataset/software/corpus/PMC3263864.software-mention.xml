<p>OBJECTIVEdC-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD); whether the effects are modified by diabetes status still is unclear. This study investigated 
these issues and assessed the added value of CRP to predictions. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdParticipants were drawn from representative 
samples of adults living in England and Scotland. Cox proportional hazards regression models 
were used to relate baseline plasma CRP with all-cause and CVD mortality during follow-up in 
men and women with and without diabetes. The added value of CRP to the predictions was 
assessed through c-statistic comparison and relative integrated discrimination improvement. </p>

<p>RESULTSdA total of 25,979 participants (4.9% with diabetes) were followed for a median of 
93 months, during which period there were 2,767 deaths (957 from CVD). CRP (per SD log e ) was 
associated with a 53% (95% CI 43-64) and 43% (38-49) higher risk of cardiovascular and all-
cause mortality, respectively. These associations were log linear and did not differ according to 
diabetes status (both P $ 0.08 for interaction), sex, and other risk factors. Adding CRP to 
conventional risk factors improved predictions overall and separately by diabetes status but 
not for CVD mortality, although such improvements only were marginal based on several dis-
crimination statistics. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdThe association between CRP and CVD was similar across diabetes status, 
and the effects are broadly similar across levels of other conventional risk factors. </p>

<p>W </p>

<p>ith classic risk factors failing to 
fully explain the variance in cardio-
vascular disease (CVD), investi-
gators have sought to identify new risk 
indices (1-3). This effort has implicated 
several biomarkers, potentially reflecting 
different metabolic pathways, in the etiol-
ogy of CVD (3). C-reactive protein (CRP), 
an inflammatory biomarker, is one of the </p>

<p>most well-documented emerging CVD 
risk factors (4,5). Concentrations of CRP 
in the upper part of the distribution within 
the normal range and above are associated 
with the long-term risk of CVD and all-
cause mortality in different populations 
(6,7). 
There is a suggestion that the associ-
ation of CRP with CVD is modified by </p>

<p>diabetes status (8); however, few such 
studies exist. In the present population-
based cohort studies among individuals 
with and without diabetes, we investi-
gated the associations of baseline plasma 
CRP levels with cardiovascular and all-
cause mortality. In doing so, we also took 
the opportunity to investigate whether 
these associations were modified by sex 
and other conventional cardiovascular 
risk factors. In addition, we examined 
whether the knowledge of CRP can im-
prove CVD risk prediction beyond conven-
tional risk factors alone. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODSdParticipants were 25,979 
individuals with data available on diabe-
tes status (history of doctor-diagnosed or 
newly diagnosed diabetes based on an 
HbA 1c $6.5%) and CRP at baseline. They 
were drawn from four prospective U.K. 
studies comprising either Scottish health 
surveys (1998 and 2003) or the health 
surveys for England (1998 and 2003) 
(9). All cohorts were representative of 
the general population, sampling individ-
uals living in households in each country. 
Study participants gave full informed 
consent, and ethical approval was ob-
tained from the London Research Ethics 
Council. 
The full study protocol has been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (10,11). In 
brief, study members were visited twice 
in their homes. During the first of these 
meetings, trained interviewers collected 
data on demographics and health behav-
iors, including socioeconomic status (as 
indexed by occupational social class) 
and self-reported smoking, alcohol use 
(frequency per week), and physical activ-
ity (frequency of moderate to vigorous 
sessions per week). Interviewers also col-
lected information about existing physician-
diagnosed CVD (stroke, ischemic heart 
disease, and angina symptoms), other 
medical conditions (hypertension and di-
abetes), and antihypertension medications 
(b-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, </p>

<p>and calcium blockers). During the second 
visit, conducted within a few days of the 
first, nurses gathered clinical data. In the 
seated position, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressures were measured on three 
occasions using an Omron HEM-907, 
with a 5-min rest between each reading; 
an average of the second and third read-
ings was used in the present analyses. </p>

<p>Biochemical measures 
Peripheral blood samples were collected 
in serum tubes and centrifuged at room 
temperature. All serum samples were 
frozen at 270 
8 C until assay. CRP concen-
trations were analyzed from serum using 
the N Latex high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) 
mono immunoassay on the Behring Neph-
elometer II analyzer. The limit of detection 
was 0.17 mg/L, and the coefficient of var-
iation was ,6% for this assay. The analysis 
of HbA 1c levels from plasma was per-
formed using the Tosoh G7 analyzer (To-
soh Bioscience, Worcestershire, U.K.), 
with a coefficient of variation ,2.5%. </p>

<p>Ascertainment of disease-specific 
mortality 
Consenting study members were linked 
to the National Health Service mortality re-
cords, from which a death certificate was 
located. Classification of the underlying 
cause of death was based on information 
on the death certificate together with any 
additional observations made by the certi-
fying physician. Diagnoses for primary 
cause of death were made using the ICD-
9 and ICD-10, 390-459, denoting CVD 
deaths. </p>

<p>Statistical methods 
Normal distribution was obtained with 
the natural logarithm (log e ) of the posi-
tively skewed CRP. Cox proportional haz-
ards regression models were used to 
compute the hazard ratio and accompa-
nying 95% CI for a 1-SD increase in log e 
CRP in relation to all-cause and CVD 
mortality. The proportional hazards as-
sumption was tested with the use of the 
cumulative sums of Martingale-based re-
siduals methods (12) and found not to be 
violated. Cox models were also used to 
compare participants across quintiles of 
CRP and across three subgroups defined 
by CRP ,1, 1-3, and .3 mg/L (13), with 
95% CIs in both analyses derived from 
the floating absolute-risk methods (14). 
The log linearity of the association was as-
sessed by fitting a continuous predictor 
across quintiles of CRP. Interaction between 
diabetes and CRP was assessed by adding </p>

<p>an interaction term to models that in-
cluded the main effect of diabetes and 
log e CRP. The heterogeneity of the associ-
ation also was assessed within sex and 
other subgroups of participants defined 
by the level of classical risk factors (above 
vs. below the median for continuous var-
iables). Heterogeneity across subgroups 
was assessed through three-way interac-
tion tests. 
The predictive utility of the models 
was assessed overall and separately for 
participants with and without diabetes by 
computing the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC). 
AUC comparisons used nonparametric 
methods (15). The relative integrated dis-
crimination improvement (RIDI%), which 
measures the percentage improvement in 
discrimination when an extra variable is 
added to a prediction model (16), was 
computed. The 95% CIs for the RIDI% 
were derived with the use of the nonpara-
metric bootstrap percentiles CI method, 
based on 1,000 replications. We also cal-
culated 1) the likelihood ratio x 
2 , which 
compares the adequacy of a model with 
covariates fitted to a set of data to that of 
the null model (without covariates) fitted 
to the same dataset; and 2) the Akaike in-
formation criterion (AIC), which allows 
for comparisons between models (nested 
or not); the smaller the value of the statis-
tic, the better the model fits the data (17). 
Finally, we assessed the closeness between 
predicted and observed outcome rates us-
ing the Hosmer and Lemeshow calibration 
test (18). The basic model included age, 
sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, 
BMI, waist circumference, physical activ-
ity, and total cholesterol. Additional mod-
els were constructed by adding CRP to the 
basic model as well as interaction terms of 
CRP with diabetes status and sex. The in-
cremental value of CRP was further as-
sessed by refitting the Framingham 
Anderson general equation for the predic-
tion of cardiovascular mortality (without 
electrocardiographic left ventricular hy-
pertrophy, a missing predictor in our sam-
ple) data with and without CRP (19). 
Comparisons were extended with the com-
putation of the net reclassification im-
provement (16) based on four categories 
of 5-year predicted probability (i.e., 0 to 
,2.5, 2.5 to ,5, 5 to ,7.5, and $7.5%). 
The main analyses included all par-
ticipants with valid data. Sensitivity anal-
yses also were conducted to account for 
the possible effects of infections and other 
factors on baseline levels of CRP, because 
these could distort the association of CRP </p>

<p>with outcomes. This was performed by 
restricting the analyses to those partici-
pants with baseline levels of CRP #10 
mg/L. All data analysis used <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS/STAT</rs> 
version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.1</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, 
Cary, NC). </p>

<p>RESULTSdOf 25,979 participants in-
cluded, 1,283 (4.9%) had diabetes. Par-
ticipants mainly were white (97.7%), with 
ethnic minorities (2.4%) comprising 
three distinct groups (black: 144 [0.6%], 
Asians: 321 [1.2%], and others: 126 
[0.5%]). The median CRP was 1.8 mg/L 
(interquartile range 0.8-4.1) overall; 1.7 
mg/L (0.8-3.6) in men and 2 mg/L (0.8- 4.5) in women (Wilcoxon test, P , 
0.0001); and 3.2 mg/L (1.5-6.2) and 1.8 
mg/L (0.8-4.0), respectively, in partici-
pants with and without diabetes (P , 
0.0001). The relationships between quin-
tiles of CRP and study covariates are de-
picted in Table 1 and Supplementary 
Table 1 based on three subgroups of 
CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, and .3 mg/L). The 
least favorable levels of conventional risk 
factors were apparent in the higher CRP 
groups. Most of these relationships were 
stepwise across the CRP quintiles. </p>

<p>Fatal outcomes 
A median follow-up of 93 months (25th 
to 75th percentiles 56-118) gave rise to 
2,767 deaths (cumulative incidence 
10.6%) recorded (including 1,466 [53%] 
deaths in men and 1,301 [47%] in 
women), of which 957 (cumulative inci-
dence 3.7%) were of cardiovascular origin 
(including 535 [56%] cardiovascular 
deaths in men and 422 [44%] in women). 
During this period, 305 (23.8%) deaths, 
including 134 cardiovascular deaths (cu-
mulative frequency 10.4%), were recor-
ded in participants with diabetes. The 
equivalent in those without diabetes was 
2,462 (10%) all-cause deaths and 823 
(3.3%) cardiovascular deaths. </p>

<p>CRP and outcomes overall and by 
diabetes status 
CRP was positively and continuously 
associated with CVD and all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality, with an SD higher 
log e CRP conferring a 53% (95% CI 43-64) 
higher risk of cardiovascular death and a 
43% (38-49) higher risk of death from 
any cause. In people with and without di-
abetes, an SD higher log e CRP was associ-
ated with 54% (28-85) and 52% (41-63), 
respectively, greater risk of cardiovascular 
death and 53% (35-72) and 41% (35-47), 
respectively, greater risk of all-cause </p>

<p>mortality. There was little evidence of het-
erogeneity by diabetes status for those as-
sociations (both P $ 0.08 for interaction). 
Across quintiles of CRP distribution, there 
also was a graded association between 
CRP and mortality overall and in partici-
pants with and without diabetes. These 
associations were log linear for both all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality (all 
P , 0.0001 for log linearity) (Fig. 1). 
Across subgroups of participants based 
on three categories of CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, 
and .3 mg/L), there also was a graded 
association between CRP and outcomes, ex-
cept in people with diabetes, for whom a 
higher risk of all-cause mortality was ob-
served only in those within the upper stra-
tum (Supplementary Table 2). </p>

<p>CRP and outcomes by sex and other 
conventional risk factors 
In men and women with and without 
diabetes, CRP also was continuously as-
sociated with the risk of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality, again with little 
evidence of statistical interaction (all P $ 
0.06). For the two outcomes, point esti-
mates for the associations with CRP in 
women with and without diabetes always 
were higher than those in their male 
counterparts. For instance, the hazard ra-
tios for an SD higher log e CRP, diabetes 
versus no diabetes, were 1.41 (95% CI 
1.29-1.54) and 1.51 (1.38-1.66) for car-
diovascular death in men and 1.27 (1.21-
1.34) and 1.46 (1.38-1.54) for all-cause 
mortality. The equivalent figures in 
women were 1.44 (1.07-1.93) and 1.81 
(1.36-2.39) for cardiovascular death and 
1.53 (1.27-1.83) and 1.64 (1.35-1.98) 
for all-cause mortality. The higher-order 
interaction tests always confirmed that as-
sociations of CRP with cardiovascular 
(three-way interaction P = 0.80) and all-
cause (three-way interaction P = 0.08) 
mortality were similar in people with and 
without diabetes for both sexes. Across 
quintiles of CRP distribution, graded asso-
ciations of CRP with both outcomes were 
observed in men and women with and 
without diabetes (Fig. 1). Associations 
mostly were log linear in subgroups de-
fined by sex and diabetes status. Based on 
the three subgroups of CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, 
and .3 mg/L), there also was a graded as-
sociation of CRP with both outcomes in 
men and with CVD mortality in women, 
with a significant high risk of all-cause mor-
tality observed only within the upper strata 
of CRP (Supplementary Table 2).

<p>CRP, diabetes, and mortality </p>

<p>to diabetes status is summarized in Sup-
plementary Table 3. Within subgroups, 
the association of CRP with cardiovascular 
mortality was similar in participants with 
and without diabetes (all P value $17 for 
interaction). Associations also were broadly 
similar within subgroups for all-cause 
mortality but with two exceptions. For this 
outcome, significant heterogeneity was 
apparent in those below the median of 
BMI (P = 0.01 for interaction) and physical 
activity frequency (P = 0.04), largely driven 
by the small number of participants with 
diabetes within those subgroups. Across 
complementary subgroups, associations 
of CRP with cardiovascular mortality by di-
abetes status always were similar (all P $ 
0.09 for the three-way interaction tests). </p>

<p>Added value of CRP to CVD risk 
prediction 
Measures of model performance are sum-
marized in Table 2 for the total cohort and 
participants with and without diabetes 
separately. The basic model (without CRP) 
had acceptable to good discriminatory </p>

<p>power in predicting cardiovascular and 
all-cause mortality, with an AUC ranging 
from 0.748, for cardiovascular mortality 
in people with diabetes, to 0.859 for the 
same outcome in participants without di-
abetes. Adding CRP to the basic model 
improved both the model goodness of fit 
and its discriminatory power. In partici-
pants with diabetes, however, there was 
no evidence for improvements in the 
AUC for the prediction of cardiovascular 
death (P = 0.31 for the difference in AUC). 
Despite some attenuation in the effect 
sizes, CRP always was positively associ-
ated with the outcomes in all multivariable 
models. Fit statistics for models with con-
tinuous log e CRP were better than those 
for the equivalent models with three cate-
gories of CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, and .3 mg/ 
L). For instance, at the total cohort level, 
the AIC and Dlikelihood ratio x 
2 (main vs. 
basic models) for CVD mortality were 
9,732 and 46, respectively, for models 
with log e CRP and 9,746 and 31, respec-
tively, for models with three categories for 
CRP (Table 2). Adding the interaction </p>

<p>terms of sex 3 CRP or diabetes 3 CRP 
(applicable only to the total cohort) did 
not improve the performance of the model 
(Table 2). 
Based on RIDI% estimates, adding 
CRP to the basic model conferred similar 
levels of improvement for cardiovascular 
mortality prediction in the total cohort and 
in participants with and without diabetes 
taken separately (Table 3). For the predic-
tion of all-cause mortality, the magnitude 
of the improvement was greater for partic-
ipants with diabetes (RIDI% 17.52 [95% CI 
4.87-38.13]), although the CI was large 
and always overlapped with other esti-
mates. For the prediction of CVD mortality 
in diabetic participants, RIDI% was not sig-
nificant when CRP was added to the basic 
model (RIDI% 3.03 [20.26 to 18.14]). 
In multivariable Cox models that in-
corporated components of the Framing-
ham Anderson CVD mortality risk score, 
CRP was significantly associated with CVD 
mortality during follow-up (hazard ratio 
per SD log e 1.36 [95% CI 1.24-1.48]).

<p>addition of log e CRP to this model was 
significant (change in x 
2 = 47.5, P , 
0.0001). The AUC for the prediction of 
5-year CVD mortality was 0.873 (95% 
CI 0.856-0.890) for the multivariable 
model only and 0.877 (0.860-0.894) 
with the addition of log e CRP (P = 0.02 
for the difference in AUC). The net reclassi-
fication improvement was 20.4% (P = 0.49). </p>

<p>Sensitivity analysis 
CRP level was .10 mg/L in 1,973 partic-
ipants (including 170 with diabetes) who 
were excluded in secondary analyses. In 
the subcohort with CRP #10 mg/L 
(24,006 participants [4.6% with diabe-
tes]), 2,273 deaths (236 in participants 
with diabetes), of which 786 (112 in par-
ticipants with diabetes) were cardiovascu-
lar deaths, were recorded. In this subcohort, 
CRP also was continuously associated 
with cardiovascular and total mortality, 
similarly among participants with diabetes 
and those without. The hazard ratios for a 
log e SD higher CRP in participants with 
diabetes and those without diabetes were 
1.46 (95% CI 1.18-1.81) and 1.44 (1.32-
1.58) for CVD death (P $ 0.69 for inter-
action) and 1.21 (1.05-1.38) and 1.26 
(1.19-1.32) for all-cause mortality (P $ 
0.83 for interaction). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdFindings from this 
study confirm that CRP is an independent 
risk factor for CVD and all-cause mortal-
ity. The associations of CRP with these 
two outcomes mostly are log linear and 
seem to be similar in participants with and 
without diabetes. The magnitude of the 
relationship of CRP with CVD and all-cause 
mortality did not seem to vary markedly by 
diabetes status, sex, and other conventional 
cardiovascular risk factors. Knowledge from 
CRP significantly adds to all-cause mortality 
prediction beyond the performance ach-
ieved with the use of conventional risk 
factors alone but not to CVD mortality 
prediction in people with diabetes. </p>

<p>Previous studies 
In the Hoorn Study (20), it was suggested 
that the magnitude of the association of 
CRP with cardiovascular death was simi-
lar in participants with type 2 diabetes 
and those without. This study, however, 
was largely underpowered, with only 24 
cardiovascular deaths in the overall pop-
ulation of 610 participants (169 with dia-
betes), and, as a result, associations of 
CRP with cardiovascular mortality were 
nonsignificant in the total cohort and sub-
groups (20). In the Strong Heart Study </p>

<p>CRP, diabetes, and mortality </p>

<p>(21), Honolulu Heart Program (22), and 
the study by Biasucci et al. (23), CRP 
was a significant predictor of CVD only 
among participants without diabetes, 
and point estimates, when provided, 
were lower in participants with diabetes 
but with a substantial overlap of the con-
fidence interval about point estimates in 
those with and without diabetes (21-23). 
In those three studies, statistical interaction, 
if any, was not formally tested. In the Emerg-
ing Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC) over-
view, where statistical interaction was tested, 
CRP was a similar determinant of coronary 
heart disease in participants with diabetes 
and those without (7). </p>

<p>Mechanisms of effect 
Several mechanistic pathways have been 
suggested to explain the accelerated 
atherothrombotic process in people with 
diabetes. Those related to chronic hyper-
glycemia include oxidative stress, advanced 
glycation end products, endothelial dys-
function, acute-phase response, and proco-
agulant states. Based on these mechanisms, 
differences in the effects of CRP on CVD 
risk could be hypothetically observed in 
people with and without diabetes (with a 
less favorable risk for the former) as the 
result of differences in the pathological 
processes responsible for increased CRP in 
people with and without diabetes. The 
absence of any significant heterogeneity in 
our study and the large ERFC overview (7) 
argues against such a hypothesis. Some 
have instead suggested that other cardio-
vascular risk factors that frequently dis-
played less favorable levels in people 
with diabetes compared with those with-
out can mask the association between CRP 
and CVD and make it a less stronger de-
terminant in people with diabetes (24). 
However, our data, and other adequately 
powered studies (7), have shown that de-
spite attenuation in effect estimates after 
adjustment for multiple cardiovascular 
risk factors, the association of CRP with 
CVD does not differ by diabetes status. </p>

<p>Sex differentials 
In the ERFC overview (7), there was a sig-
nificant heterogeneity between men and 
women in the association of CRP with 
coronary heart disease, with the magni-
tude of the association being less impor-
tant in women. Others instead have found 
significant interactions in both people 
with and without diabetes, with greater ef-
fect estimates always recorded in women 
(8). We found that CRP affected the risk 
of mortality in similar ways in men and </p>

<p>women regardless of their diabetes status. 
Some apparent differences by sex in the 
effect estimates were a reflection of the 
low statistical power in some subgroups, 
as indicated by wider CI about estimates 
and the lack of any significant interaction 
by diabetes status within and across sex 
subgroups. </p>

<p>Incremental predictive utility of CRP 
The incremental value of CRP to CVD 
prediction has been largely assessed in the 
general population (25,26) but less in 
people with diabetes (27). Results in the 
general population have been inconsis-
tent, with some showing marginal to siz-
able improvement and others no added 
value at all (25,26). However, methods 
for assessing improvement in model per-
formance in many of those studies have 
been largely criticized (25,26). One study 
in people with diabetes found that adding 
CRP to established risk factors had mean-
ingless effects on the performance of 
models in predicting cardiovascular mor-
tality (27). This is consistent with our 
findings of nonsignificant improvement 
in the goodness-of-fit statistics and dis-
criminatory power subsequent to adding 
CRP in people with diabetes. However, 
such improvement was more apparent 
in people with diabetes for the prediction 
of all-cause mortality and among partici-
pants without diabetes and the total co-
hort for both outcomes. However, the 
clinical and public health relevance of 
the range of improvement found has to 
be questioned. </p>

<p>Study limitations and strengths 
The current analyses were based on a single 
measurement of CRP, and there was no 
possibility to adjust for regression dilution 
bias (7). Our results, however, are similar 
to those from studies that have performed 
such adjustment (7). In addition, it has 
been demonstrated that CRP was stable 
enough for use in long-term predictions 
(3). The percentage of people with diabe-
tes in our population was low as a result of 
the use of self-reported diagnosis without 
testing of blood glucose levels. Character-
istics of diabetes, such as etiologic types 
and use of insulin were poorly defined, 
and data were not available on the duration 
of diagnosed diabetes and urinary albumin 
excretion, both powerful determinants of 
cardiovascular risk in people with diabe-
tes. Therefore, we were unable to account 
for their possible effects in regression 
analyses. Our study also has major 
strengths, including its large sample </p>

<p>size and number of deaths recorded, our 
ability to directly compare the effects of 
CRP on mortality risk in people with 
and without diabetes, and our ability 
to assess the possible effects of sex and 
other cardiovascular risk factors on the 
observed relationships. 
Based on available evidence (4,28,29), 
a causal role for CRP in CVD is less certain. 
Therefore, CRP may not be a target for 
CVD prevention (2,30). It is expected 
that trials of specific CRP antagonists and 
low-dose methotrexate will clarify this in 
the future (31). The JUPITER (Justifica-
tion for the Use of Statins in Primary Pre-
vention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating 
Rosuvastatin) has shown that CRP was use-
ful for targeting statin therapy in healthy 
individuals with normal-range LDL choles-
terol (32). Other studies have suggested in-
consistent effects of CRP on CVD risk 
prediction beyond traditional predictors 
(25,26). Our study suggests that CRP lev-
els convey prediction information on the 
risk of CVD that is complementary to that 
provided by conventional cardiovascular 
risk factors and that improvement in the 
predictions is likely similar in people with 
diabetes and those without but is not af-
fected by sex. Such improvements, how-
ever, remain modest and do not lend 
strong support to any recommendation of 
routinely measuring CRP for the purpose of 
enhancing the prediction of future risk of 
major outcomes. Our study also extends 
previous reports that traditional risk factors 
were similar determinants of the risk of 
CVD regardless of diabetes status (33-35). </p>
