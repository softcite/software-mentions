<p>Abstract presented at the Renal Week 2009 of </p>

<p>These patients were followed 
until death or June 2009. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. The cut-
off value of cTnT for AMI was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve. We calculated Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and potential outcome 
predictors were determined by Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: AMIs 
were diagnosed in 40 patients (14.1%). The area under the curve was 0.98 in the 
ROC curve (p&lt;0.001; 95% CI, 0.95-1.00). The summation of sensitivity and spec-
ificity was highest at the initial cTnT value of 0.35 ng/mL (sensitivity, 0.95; speci-
ficity, 0.97). Survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference in all-
cause and cardiovascular mortalities for the group with an initial cTnT ≥0.35 ng/ 
mL compared to the other groups. Initial serum cTnT concentration was an inde-
pendent predictor for mortality. Conclusion: Because ESRD patients with an ini-
tial cTnT concentration ≥0.35 ng/mL have a poor prognosis, it is suggested that ur-
gent diagnosis and treatment be indicated in dialysis patients with ACS when the 
initial cTnT levels are ≥0.35 ng/mL. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Patient population 
This study included ESRD patients on maintenance hemo-
dialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis 
(CAPD) with ACS between March 2002 and February 
2008 at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital in 
Seoul, Korea. We retrospectively reviewed demographic, 
clinical, and laboratory data using the medical records. We 
excluded patients &lt;18 years of age and with the following 
conditions: skeletal muscle trauma, myositis, rhabdomyoly-
sis, and seizures. Cardiovascular disease was defined as a 
history of AMI, angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, 
stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral vascular dis-
ease given by the patient and confirmed from the medical 
notes. 
According to the definition of an AMI by the joint Euro-
pean Society of Cardiology and American College of Car-
diology Committee in 2000, AMI was diagnosed in patients 
with a typical rise and gradual fall of CK/CK-MB with at 
least one of the following: ischemic symptoms, develop-
ment of pathologic Q waves or changes in the ST segment 
on the ECG, or coronary artery intervention. </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>Follow-up data of the enrolled subjects were reviewed 
until death or June 2009. The date of death was defined as 
the end point. In the case of patients who did not have fol-
low-up until December 2009, an inquiry was made by 
phone call. Patients who underwent revascularization after 
enrollment were not treated as censored in the analysis. </p>

<p>Laboratory measurements 
The serum cTnT concentration by the third generation cTnT 
test and the serum CK-MB level were measured on the 
Elecsys 2010 immunoassay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, 
Mannheim, Germany). The third generation cTnT test uses 
the same monoclonal antibodies (M11.7 and M7) as the 
second generation test, but is standardized with human re-
combinant cTnT instead of bovine cTnT. The detection 
limit and concentration corresponding to the 10% total co-
efficient of variation of the assay are &lt;0.01 and 0.03 ng/mL, 
respectively. The medical decision cut-off for AMI on the 
ROC curve was 0.1 ng/mL. </p>

<p>disease (ESRD) patients. 
1-4 The death rate from cardiovas-
cular disease in ESRD patients is 20-40 fold higher than in 
the general population. 
5 The prevalence of coronary artery 
disease in ESRD patients has been reported to be as high as 
73%, 
6 and 72% of ESRD patients with an acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) do not survive 2 years. 
7 Therefore, it is in-
creasingly apparent that chronic renal dysfunction alone is 
an independent risk factor for the development of coronary 
artery disease. </p>

<p>3 </p>

<p>The diagnosis of AMI has traditionally relied upon the 
combination of chest pain, electrocardiographic (ECG) man-
ifestations, and elevations in serum biomarkers of cardiac 
injury. However, chest symptoms and ECG abnormalities 
are frequently atypical or absent in ESRD patients, which 
may delay diagnosis and adversely affect outcomes. 
8 As a 
result, the diagnosis of AMI has increasingly depended 
upon evaluation of blood biomarkers, particularly troponins. 
Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) are cardiac regulato-
ry proteins that control the calcium-mediated interaction of 
actin and myosin. Because of their increased specificity com-
pared with creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and other mark-
ers, serum troponins are the preferred marker for diagnosis 
of AMI. 
Because morbidity and mortality due to coronary heart dis-
ease are extremely high in ESRD patients, sensitive and spe-
cific screening tests for diagnosing AMI are needed. Howev-
er, cTnT is significantly higher than the usual cut-off value 
(0.1 ng/mL) in many ESRD patients without clinically ap-
parent evidence of AMI, so the specificity of cTnT has been 
reported to be as low as 46% in long-term hemodialysis pa-
tients. 
9 A study involving ESRD patients without clinical or 
ECG evidence of acute ischemia reported up to 71% of pa-
tients with increased cTnT using the first generation cTnT 
assay, and the number declined to 17% when a more cardi-
ac-specific, second generation cTnT assay was used. </p>

<p>10 </p>

<p>However, there has been little data reported on the clinical 
efficacy of cTnT measured by the third generation assay in 
patients with ESRD. 
An elevated level of cTnT is also used as a predictive fac-
tor for adverse outcomes among asymptomatic dialysis pa-
tients. A meta-analysis of 28 studies consisting of 3,931 as-
ymptomatic ESRD patients concluded that elevated cTnT 
levels were associated with an increased mortality risk. 
11 In 
addition, an increased cTnT independently predicted short-
term prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS). </p>

these medications. </p>

<p>Determination of a more appropriate cTnT cut-off 
value for AMI 
AMIs were diagnosed in 40 patients (14.1%), and coronary 
angiography was performed in 52 patients (18.3%). Twen-
ty-six patients (9.2%) underwent percutaneous coronary in-
tervention; the remaining patients were treated medically. 
The ROC curve of cTnT for AMIs is shown in Fig. 1. The 
area under the curve (AUC) was 0.98 in the ROC curve 
(p&lt;0.001; 95% CI, 0.95-1.00). The summation of sensitivi-
ty and specificity was highest at the initial cTnT value of 
0.35 ng/mL; the sensitivity was 0.95 and the specificity was 
0.97 (Table 2). </p>

<p>cholesterol, total calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, albumin, 
and CK concentrations were measured by an autoanalyzer 
(Hitachi 7600; Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The high sensi-
tivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were determined us-
ing Hitachi7605 analyzer (Hitachi Ltd.). </p>

<p>Statistical analyses 
Statistical analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software for 
Windows, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 15.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). All 
data were expressed as mean±SD or median (interquartile 
range, IQR) unless otherwise specified. The cut-off value of 
cTnT for an AMI was evaluated using a ROC curve. To de-
termine the prognostic value of the initial serum cTnT con-
centrations in ESRD patients, we calculated survival curves 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The potential outcome pre-
dictors were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard analysis 
to determine the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mor-
talities in ESRD patients. p values &lt;0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Baseline characteristics 
This study included 284 ESRD patients on maintenance 
HD or CAPD between March 2002 and February 2008. 
These patients presented with acute chest pain or discom-
fort, and were promptly diagnosed with ACS. 
The demographic, clinical, and baseline laboratory find-
ings for all patients are summarized in Table 1. The mean 
patient age was 60.9±13.9; 148 patients (52.1%) were males. 
Of the 284 patients, 247 (87.0%) and 37 (13.0%) were 
managed with HD and CAPD, respectively. The mean du-
ration of dialysis was 19.1±27.8 months. Primary causes of 
ESRD were diabetes mellitus in 154 patients (54.2%), hy-
pertension in 48 patients (16.9%), biopsy-proven primary 
chronic glomerulonephritis in 5 patients (1.8%), others (e.g., 
polycystic kidney disease and lupus nephritis) in 16 patients 
(5.6%), and unknown in 61 patients (21.5%). The median 
CK activity was 85.5 IU/L (IQR, 44.0-198.3 IU/L), the me-
dian CK-MB was 4.0 ng/mL (IQR, 2.0-7.0 ng/mL), and the 
median cTnT was 0.11 ng/mL (IQR, 0.06-0.25 ng/mL). 
When the use of aspirin (39.1% vs. 42.5%, p=0.441), beta-
blockers (27.8% vs. 29.2%, p=0.780), HMG-CoA reduc-
tase inhibitors (13.4% vs. 16.5%, p=0.339), and renin an-
giotensin system blockers (35.9% vs. 37.5%, p=0.722) 
were compared before and after event occurrence, there </p>

(RR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.15; p=0.000) were significant 
factors for predicting all-cause mortality. However, gender, 
history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, dialysis 
modality, and duration of dialysis were not significantly re-
lated to all-cause mortality. When adjustments were made 
in a multivariate Cox regression model, age (RR: 1.06; </p>

<p>Clinical outcomes during the follow-up period 
The patients were followed for up to 88 months (median, 19 
months). During the follow-up period, 87 patients (30.6%) 
died, 37 (13.0%) of whom died of cardiovascular causes. 
Other causes of mortality were infection in 20 patients 
(7.7%), unknown in 17 patients who were pronounced dead 
on arrival (6.0%), and others (e.g., malignancy, upper gas-
trointestinal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy) in 11 
patients (3.9%). 
Since the 99th percentile and cut-off value of cTnT for 
AMI in the general population are known to be 0.01 ng/mL 
and 0.1 ng/mL, 
15 respectively, and the summation of sensitivi-
ty and specificity was shown to be highest at 0.35 ng/mL in 
the current study, the enrolled patients were divided into four 
groups on the basis of initial cTnT concentrations: 1) cTnT 
≤0.01 ng/mL; 2) 0.01&lt;cTnT&lt;0.1 ng/mL; 3) 0.1≤cTnT&lt;0.35 
ng/mL; and 4) cTnT≥0.35 ng/mL. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis showed a statistically significant difference in all-
cause mortality for the group with initial &gt;cTnT 0.35 ng/mL 
compared to the other groups (log rank; p&lt;0.001). This effect 
was more prominent in cardiovascular mortality (Fig. 2). 
Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age (RR:

<p>cTnT in ESRD Patients with ACS </p>

<p>it had the highest sensitivity and specificity in ESRD pa-
tients with ACS. In addition, all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortalities of patients whose initial cTnT levels were ≥0.35 
ng/mL were much higher than the other groups. 
A cTnT level of 0.1 ng/mL is currently used as the cut-off 
value for AMIs in the general population. In ESRD pa-
tients, however, a number of studies have reported that false 
positive elevations in cTnT level, even without evidence of 
myocardial injury, are not uncommon. 
16-19 Several studies 
have suggested the following possible reasons for elevated 
cTnT without myocardial damage: left ventricular hyper-
trophy, endothelial dysfunction, leakage of free cytosolic 
troponin pool, stretch-mediated troponin release, and im-
paired renal excretion. </p>

<p>17-19 </p>

<p>In this study, the summation of sensitivity and specificity 
of cTnT for AMI in ESRD patients with ACS peaked at 0.35 
ng/mL. At a value of 0.1 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 98%, yet 
the specificity was only 65%. Although AMI is such a seri-
ous complication that it is important for the screening test to 
have high sensitivity, a 35% false positive rate cannot be ig-
nored. Therefore, we suggest that an initial cTnT concentra-
tion of 0.35 ng/mL in ESRD patients with ACS is a more ap-
propriate cut-off value for AMI, even though patients with 
lower levels of cTnT should also be carefully monitored. 
Plasma concentrations of total CK are also elevated in 
42% of ESRD patients without myocardial damage, 
20 and </p>

<p>95% CI: 1.02-1.09; p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (RR: 2.91; 
95% CI: 1.24-6.84; p=0.015), serum cTnT (RR: 1.12; 95% 
CI: 1.03-1.22; p=0.008), and hsCRP levels (RR: 1.09; 95% 
CI: 1.04-1.15; p=0.000) were independent predictors for 
all-cause mortality (Table 3). 
Factors correlated with cardiovascular mortality were 
also evaluated with univariate Cox regression analysis. Age 
(RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04-1.10; p=0.000), diabetes mellitus 
(RR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.04-4.29; p=0.038), initial serum 
cTnT (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.09-1.24; p=0.000), and STEMI 
(RR: 9.98; 95% CI: 3.48-28.65; p=0.000) were significant. 
However, gender, history of hypertension or cardiovascular 
disease, dialysis modality, duration of dialysis, serum albu-
min, WBC count, and hsCRP levels were not significantly 
related to cardiovascular mortality. In a multivariate Cox 
regression model, age (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03-1.09; 
p=0.000), serum cTnT (RR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.05-1.22; 
p=0.001), and STEMI (RR: 3.91; 95% CI: 1.30-11.78; 
p=0.015) were independent predictors for cardiovascular 
mortality (Table 4). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that an initial cTnT 
of 0.35 ng/mL was the best cut-off value for AMI because </p>

<p>lar mortality. In this study, patients with an elevated cTnT 
level≥0.35 ng/mL had a significantly higher risk for all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
Based on univariate Cox regression analysis, factors cor-
related with all-cause mortality were age, diabetes, STEMI, 
initial serum cTnT, serum albumin, WBC counts, and hsCRP 
levels. After adjustments, age, diabetes, serum cTnT, and 
hsCRP levels still had statistical significance. When the pa-
tients were divided into four groups according to the initial 
serum concentration of cTnT, all-cause mortality rate in pa-
tients with a moderate increase in cTnT (0.1≤cTnT&lt;0.35 
ng/mL) was not significantly different compared to patients 
with small (0.01&lt;cTnT&lt;0.1 ng/mL) or large (cTnT≥0.35 
ng/mL) increases in cTnT by log-rank test. However, patients 
with a cTnT ≥0.35 ng/mL had a significantly worse progno-
sis than all other groups, showing a higher death rate with a 
risk ratio of 8.65 compared to patients with a cTnT ≤0.01 ng/ 
mL. Because infection was the second most common cause 
of mortality, the WBC count and hsCRP level are thought 
to be significantly correlated with all-cause mortality rate. 
Cardiovascular mortality was associated with age, diabe-
tes, initial serum cTnT, and STEMI based on univariate Cox 
regression analysis. In the multivariate model, age, serum 
cTnT, and STEMI were independent predictors for cardio-
vascular mortality. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for 
cardiovascular mortality, patients with a large increase in </p>

<p>30-50% of asymptomatic HD patients exhibit an elevation 
in the CK-MB fraction. 
21,22 Moreover, 18-31% of patients 
with an ACS have elevated cTnT levels without an increase 
in the CK-MB fraction. 
23,24 Therefore, we performed sur-
vival analyses to confirm the validity of the ROC results. 
An elevation in serum cTnT levels is a well-known predic-
tive factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in as-
ymptomatic ESRD patients. 
16,25-28 Although the reasons for 
the association between elevated levels of cTnT and a poor 
prognosis are not clear, the possibility has been suggested 
that patients with increased cTnT have diffuse coronary ar-
tery disease. </p>

<p>Increased serum troponin levels are highly prognostic for 
cardiac and all-cause mortality among patients with chronic 
kidney disease with ACS. 
12,30 In the GUSTO-IV trial, ele-
vated cTnT independently predicted the 30-day prognosis 
in all patients, and patients with creatinine clearance in the 
lowest quartile (&lt;58 mL/min) also showed poor outcomes; </p>

<p>however, only 11 of 7,033 patients had severe renal impair-
ment with a creatinine clearance &lt;10 mL/min. In addition, 
it was reported that elevations in cTnI levels in patients 
with renal impairment undergoing an evaluation for myo-
cardial ischemia were at substantially higher risk for all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality.

cTnT levels in ESRD patients presenting with ACS as an 
independent predictive factor for all-cause and cardiovascu-</p>

<p>cTnT in ESRD Patients with ACS </p>

<p>cTnT (≥0.35 ng/mL) had a greater mortality rate. The hazard 
ratio of cardiovascular death in patients with a cTnT ≥0.35 
ng/mL was 6.01-fold higher than patients with a cTnT ≤0.01 
ng/mL. Therefore, an initial serum cTnT level ≥0.35 ng/mL 
is an independent predictor for all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality. 
There were several limitations to this study. First, the 
study was a relatively small-sized retrospective study from 
a single center. Therefore, larger prospective studies are 
needed to confirm the findings. Second, levels of CK/CK-
MB were used as serologic markers for the diagnostic crite-
ria of AMI in this study, and the measurement of CK/CK-
MB for diagnosing AMI has some known shortcomings. 
Of note, we excluded patients with skeletal muscle injuries 
and defined AMI as a temporal change of CK/CK-MB, 
rather than a single increased value. Third, we were unable 
to simultaneously measure serum cTnI levels. cTnT is more 
frequently elevated than cTnI among asymptomatic pa-
tients with renal insufficiency due to the relatively higher 
levels of an unbound cytosolic pool of cTnT and the higher 
molecular weight. 
24 In addition, time-dependent change of 
cTnT could not be evaluated due to the lack of repeated 
measurements of cTnT levels. Finally, we could not obtain 
data on risk factors, such as hemodynamic status and echo-
cardiographic features, along with medical history, such as 
smoking habits or family history, due to deficiencies in our 
database. 
In conclusion, although moderate elevations of cTnT are 
common in ESRD patients without AMI, measurement of 
cTnT is useful for diagnosing AMI or predicting outcomes. 
In addition, ESRD patients with an initial cTnT concentra-
tion ≥0.35 ng/mL seem to have a poor prognosis. There-
fore, we recommend that urgent diagnosis and treatment be 
indicated for ESRD patients with ACS when their initial 
cTnT levels are ≥0.35 ng/mL, due to the reasonable predic-
tive capacity of cTnT. </p>
