<p>OBJECTIVE-Haptoglobin (Hp) binds free Hb, inhibiting Hb-
induced oxidative damage. As oxidative stress has been associ-
ated with microvascular complications, we evaluated the 
relationship between Hp genotype and microalbuminuria, mac-
roalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and early renal 
function decline in type 1 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Participants from the 
Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study with DNA avail-
able were studied for the incidence of microalbuminuria (albu-
min excretion rate [AER] 20 -200 g/min), macroalbuminuria 
(AER Ͼ200 g/min), ESRD (renal dialysis or transplantation), 
and renal function decline (a decline Ն30 ml/min per 1.73 m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>from baseline estimated [by the Cockcroft-Gault equation] glo-
merular filtration rate [eGFR] in those with baseline eGFR Ͼ60 
ml/min per 1.73 m 
2 ). </p>

<p>RESULTS-The proportions with the Hp 2/2, 2/1, and 1/1 
genotype were 43.4, 44.4, and 12.1%, respectively. During 18 years 
of follow-up, the incidence of eGFR decline, microalbuminuria, 
macroalbuminuria, and ESRD was 42.0, 40.5, 16.7, and 12.2%, 
respectively. No significant univariate differences were ob-
served by Hp genotype. However, in multivariable Cox mod-
els, an ϳtwofold increased risk was observed for the Hp 2/2 
compared with the Hp 1/1 genotype for eGFR decline (hazard 
ratio 1.79 [95% CI 1.06 -3.00]) and ESRD (2.74 [1.17-6.45]); no 
significant associations were observed for microalbuminuria 
or macroalbuminuria. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS-These data suggest that although Hp geno-
type is not associated with albuminuria per se, it may be an 
independent determinant of early renal function decline and 
progression to ESRD. Understanding these apparent contradic-
tory findings may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of 
renal disease in type 1 diabetes. Diabetes Urinary albumin was measured by immunonephelometry (23), and creati-
nine was assayed by an Ectachem 400 Analyzer (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, 
NY). Microalbuminuria was defined as albumin excretion rate (AER) of 
20 -200 g/min (30 -300 mg per 24 h) and macroalbuminuria as AER Ͼ200 
g/min (Ͼ300 mg per 24 h) in at least 2 of 3 validated timed urine collections. 
In 10% of the samples, urine collections were deemed inadequate based on 
creatinine excretion and albumin-to-creatinine ratio was used (microalbumin-
uria, 0.03-0.3 mg/mg; macroalbuminuria, Ͼ0.3 mg/mg) (24). ESRD onset was 
defined as starting dialysis or undergoing renal transplantation. Early renal 
function decline was defined as the incidence of a decline of Ն30 ml/min per 
1.73 m 
2 from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the 
Cockcroft-Gault equation (25) among participants with normal or mildly 
reduced renal function at study entry (stages I and II). 
High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated using the PureGene kit 
(Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and Hp was genotyped by an amplifica-
tion method (26). Genotypes were assigned visually by comparison with 
controls of known genotype and in a random sample showed excellent 
agreement (97%) with an Eliza method (27). 
Statistical analysis. Nonnormally distributed variables were logarithmically 
transformed. Univariate associations were determined using the Student t test 
and 
2 or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Cox proportional hazards models 
with backward elimination were constructed to assess the multivariable 
association between Hp genotype and the incidence of each outcome of 
interest adjusting for traditional risk factors (including eGFR and AER levels 
at study entry) and univariately significant variables. Survival time was 
defined as the time in years from study entry to either an incident event or 
censorship during the 18-year follow-up. Statistical analyses were conducted 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.1</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC). </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Of 658 study participants, DNA for Hp genotyping was 
available for 486 (73.9%). Compared with those without </p>

<p>DNA available, individuals with DNA data had a shorter 
diabetes duration and higher HbA 1 , blood pressure, non-
HDL cholesterol, serum creatinine, eGFR, and AER. The 
distribution of the Hp genotype was 12.1% Hp 1/1, 44.4% Hp 
2/1, and 43.4% Hp 2/2. Generally, no differences were 
observed in participant characteristics by Hp genotype at 
study entry with the exception of younger age and higher 
non-HDL cholesterol in those with the Hp 2/2 compared 
with the 2/1 genotype and lower insulin dose per weight in 
those with the Hp 2/1 compared with the 1/1 genotype. 
During 18 years of follow-up, 40.5% (n ϭ 111) developed 
incident microalbuminuria, 16.7% (n ϭ 62) macroalbumin-
uria, and 12.2% (n ϭ 58) ESRD. Moreover, 188 (42.0%) 
exhibited an early decline in renal function (Ն30 ml/min 
per 1.73 m 
2 from baseline eGFR). Descriptive participant 
characteristics by incidence of microalbuminuria and mac-
roalbuminuria are shown in Table 1 and by renal function 
decline Ն30 ml/min per 1.73 m 
2 and ESRD incidence in 
Table 2. Generally, incident case subjects with both mi-
croalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were more likely to 
have higher levels of HbA 1 , non-HDL cholesterol, AER, and 
inflammatory markers compared with those who remained 
disease free. Incident case subjects with macroalbumin-
uria were also older at the time of diabetes onset com-
pared with noncase subjects and had a greater waist-to-hip 
ratio. 
Compared with noncase subjects, incident case subjects 
with early renal function decline and ESRD were older, </p>

with higher systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, 
AER, and inflammatory marker levels and lower HDL 
cholesterol. Incident case subjects with early renal func-
tion decline had an older age of diabetes onset and higher 
BMI, HbA 1 , and eGFR and lower serum creatinine. Con-
versely, greater diabetes duration and higher levels of 
diastolic blood pressure and serum creatinine but lower 
insulin dose per kilogram body weight and eGFR were 
observed in incident case subjects with ESRD compared 
with noncase subjects. No univariate association, how-
ever, was observed between Hp and the incidence of other 
renal outcomes at the 0.05 significance level. Hp genotype 
was also not associated with all-cause mortality (P ϭ 0.80) 
based on 82 (16.9%) deceased individuals. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models (Table 
3) showed no association between the Hp genotype and 
microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria incidence. Con-
versely, adjusting for univariately significant risk factors, 
an increased risk of an early renal function decline was 
observed for individuals carrying the Hp 2/2 compared 
with the Hp 1/1 genotype (hazard ratio 1.79 [95% CI ϭ 
1.06 -3.00]). Similarly, the Hp 2/2 conferred over a twofold 
increased risk of ESRD compared with the Hp 1/1 geno-
type (2.45 [1.05-5.73]). The risk associated with the Hp 2/1 </p>

<p>reached statistical significance for neither early renal 
function decline nor ESRD incidence. 
To examine the possibility of survival bias, we stratified 
the cohort by diabetes diagnosis year (prior to or after 
1965, wherein mortality was 40 vs. 13%, respectively). With 
the exception of macroalbuminuria, a trend toward higher 
incidence rates among the Hp 2/2 compared with the Hp 
1/1 genotype was generally observed in those diagnosed 
after 1965 (less subject to survival bias); however, none of 
the stratified results were statistically significant (Table 4). 
Similarly, when conducting cumulative incidence analyses 
(including prevalent cases in outcomes), results demon-
strated nonsignificantly higher rates in those carrying the 
Hp 2/2 compared with the Hp 1/1 genotype with the 
exception of macroalbuminuria (Table 4). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>In this cohort of subjects with type 1 diabetes, we failed to 
show an association between the Hp genotype and either 
microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria incidence. How-
ever, although not univariately significant, approximately a 
twofold increased risk emerged for outcomes assessing </p>

<p>renal function decline and ESRD incidence after multiva-
riable adjustments. 
Previous studies assessing the association between the 
Hp phenotype and the presence or incidence of renal 
disease have produced discrepant findings. In a small, 
cross-sectional study of normotensive subjects with type 1 
or 2 diabetes, none of those with the Hp 1/1 phenotype 
exhibited signs of nephropathy (0/18) compared with 27% 
(10/37) of those with Hp 2/1 and 34% (19/55) of those with 
Hp 2/2 (P Ͻ 0.02) (6,28). Similar results were reported 
from an Irish type 1 diabetes case-control study (29). 
Conversely, a Japanese study of individuals with a long 
duration (Ͼ10 years) of type 2 diabetes did not observe an 
increased risk associated with the common Hp phenotype 
(P ϭ 0.43) (30). Similarly, we were also not able to detect 
an association for either microalbuminuria or macroalbu-
minuria incidence in our cohort of individuals with a long 
duration of type 1 diabetes, perhaps suggesting that at a 
more advanced stage of diabetes, early Hp-susceptible 
cases of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria may 
have been excluded. Indeed, the cumulative incidence of 
microalbuminuria (including both prevalent cases at study 
entry and incident cases) appeared higher in our study 
among participants carrying the Hp 2 allele, although 
results did not reach statistical significance. However, </p>

<p>analogous findings were not observed for the cumulative 
incidence of macroalbuminuria, suggesting that the Hp 2/2 
genotype is not a strong determining factor for progres-
sion to macroalbuminuria. 
Despite the null associations for the incidence of pro-
teinuria, a strong relationship was noted between the Hp 
2/2 genotype and the incidence of both an early decline in 
renal function and ESRD. Unfortunately, we are not aware 
of any published reports on the association between the 
Hp genotype and renal function decline among individuals 
with diabetes and thus cannot, at present, confirm these 
findings. However, the possibility of a factor affecting the 
incidence of renal dysfunction but not that of renal disease 
per se raises the hypothesis that these are two different 
disease entities, and thus factors contributing to their 
development may be distinct. Indeed, almost a decade ago, 
we suggested that in certain cases tubulopathy may pre-
cede glomerulopathy in type 1 diabetes and that even 
microalbuminuria may be secondary to impaired tubular 
reabsorption (31). More recently, research studies have 
shown that reductions in eGFR do occur without preced-
ing microalbuminuria in those with diabetes (32-34). Im-
portantly, a pathophysiological mechanism has been 
proposed that could account for the increased rate of renal 
function decline among individuals with diabetes and the </p>

Hp 2/2 genotype (7), based on the recognition that renal 
proximal tubule cells serve as a (secondary to CD163) 
default mechanism for clearance of the Hp-Hb complex. 
Because CD163-mediated clearance of the Hp-Hb complex 
is impaired in subjects with diabetes and the Hp 2/2 
genotype, renal proximal tubule cells are used to a greater 
extent, resulting in a dramatic increase in iron deposition, 
oxidative stress, and hypertrophy. In fact, Hp 2/2 diabetic 
mice have been shown to display significantly increased 
glomerular and proximal tubular hypertrophy and greater 
deposition of collagen type IV, smooth muscle actin, and 
increased renal iron (35). Intriguingly, vitamin E adminis-
tration was shown to slow diabetic renal disease progres-
sion among the Hp 2/2 but not the Hp 1/1 mice. 
In conclusion, we observed an association between the 
Hp genotype and renal function decline in individuals with 
long-standing type 1 diabetes. A caveat of this study is the 
lack of independent replication of findings in another 
cohort. Nevertheless, these results raise the possibility 
that pharmacological administration of vitamin E, shown 
to reduce cardiovascular disease outcomes in those with 
type 2 diabetes with the Hp 2/2 genotype (13-14), may also 
lead to reduced renal disease risk. </p>
