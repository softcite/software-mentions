<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Although noodles occupy an important place in the dietary lives of Americans, up until the present time research and in-depth data on the noodle 
consumption patterns of the US population have been very limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the food consumption and diet patterns 
of noodle consumers and non-consumers according to age, gender, income, and ethnicity. The 2001-2002 NHANES databases were used. The NHANES 
2001-2002 data showed that noodle consumers reporting noodle consumption in their 24-h recall were 2,035 individuals (23.3% of total subjects). 
According to the results, the mean noodle consumption was 304.1 g/day/person, with 334.3 g for males and 268.0 g for females. By age, the intake 
of those in the age range of 9-18 years old ranked highest at 353.0 g, followed by the order of 19-50 year-olds with 333.5 g, 51-70 year-olds 
with by 280.4 g, older than 71years old with 252.3 g, and 1-8 year-olds with 221.5 g. By gender, males consumed more noodles than females. 
Also, according to income, the intake amount for the middle-income level (PIR 1~1.85) of consumers was highest at 312.5 g. Noodle intake also 
showed different patterns by ethnicity in which the "other" ethnic group consumed the most noodles with 366.1 g, followed by, in order, Hispanics 
with 318.7 g, Whites with 298.6 g, and Blacks with 289.5 g. After comparing food consumption by dividing the subjects into noodle consumers 
and non-consumers, the former was more likely to consume milk, fish, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and alcoholic beverages while the latter preferred 
meat, poultry, bread, and non-alcohol beverages. </p>

<p>Although they originated in Asia, noodles have become one 
of the most popular foods in the United States. Growth in the 
domestic food use of wheat has accelerated during the last two 
decades and wheat flour is used to produce noodles. The U.S. 
market for pasta and noodles increased at a compound annual 
growth rate of 6.7% between 2003 and 2008, and the dried 
pasta/noodles category led the pasta and noodles market, 
accounting for 76.9% [1]. 
Japanese style (e.g., udon) and Chinese-type noodles (e.g., 
ramen) as well as spaghetti are frequently consumed in restaurants 
and at home. However, the effects of noodle consumption on 
the diet patterns and eating habits of Americans have not been 
studied in detail. 
Examining patterns of food group consumption has emerged 
as an important focal point for understanding the role of diet 
in disease risk [2-4]. Instead of determining single nutrients, 
stratifying the food groups is more likely to reflect habitual food 
intake, and embody characteristics of the total dietary intake 
[2,4,5], and embody characteristics of the total diet, including </p>

<p>all nutrient interactions. 
However, in the case of noodles, little is known about noodle 
consumption patterns and the contribution that noodle provide 
in the American diet. Dietary patterns and food groups reflect 
different ethnic eating traditions [5]. Mediterranean and Asian 
diets are widely known to incorporate higher intakes of legumes, 
fish, vegetables, and fruits, contrasted with the American dietary 
pattern consisting of higher intakes of deep-fried fast foods, 
refined grains, processed meats, commercially baked products, 
and sweets. Understanding these ethnic differences in food group 
consumption becomes increasingly significant in the United 
States as the US Census Bureau has reported that, from 1990 
to 2000, the foreign-born population increased by 57% to 
represent 13% of the total US population [6]. 
Bui and Small [7] analyzed the thiamin contents of white 
salted, yellow alkaline, and instant noodles that were 
manufactured differently. Fu [8] categorized noodle types by 
manufacturing methods and Miskelly [9] studied the historical 
aspects of noodles. 
Noodle studies have focused on manufacturing methods or 
composition analysis, or have been confined to food and cultural </p>

<p>studies, but there is little data on the effects of noodle consumption 
on diet and health status [10-28]. 
This article provides information on current noodle 
consumption patterns in the United States and the dietary intake 
of noodles by consumers in general. It also offers analyses of 
noodle consumers by income, race, and ethnicity. The primary 
objective of the research was to gain a better understanding of 
noodle consumption in the United States and whether consuming 
noodles has a beneficial effect on total diet, in which they may 
play a role in healthful eating. The contribution of economic, 
social, and demographic factors related to noodle consumption 
were examined. The differences in noodle consumption by 
income level and ethnic background provide insights into the 
factors that affect food selection among these groups. The results 
provide useful information for designing food programs and 
planning national food supply strategies. </p>

<p>Subjects and Methods </p>

<p>Data and procedures </p>

<p>We used data collected in the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002 [29], conducted by 
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. Each survey was a stratified, 
multistage, national probability sample of the civilian non-
institutionalized population of the United States. The subjects 
surveyed in NHANES 2001-2002 were of all ages. All surveys 
collected dietary information with the use of a 24-h recall 
administered by trained dietary interviewers, and the dietary 
recalls collected for the NHANES 2001-2002 survey years used 
a computer-assisted dietary interview that included a 4-step 
multiple pass approach. In NHANES 2002, the dietary data were 
collected using a 5-step multiple pass approach with dietary recall 
methods that are part of the integrated US Department of 
Agriculture and NHANES protocol "What We Eat in America" 
[30]. </p>

<p>Identification and classification of noodle consumers </p>

<p>The noodle consumers were identified and classified based on 
the intake of noodles consumed in food items. Information from 
the NHANES code book was used to identify foods that contained 
noodles. Foods containing noodles, spaghetti, macaroni, and pasta 
were included. Noodles from other sources (chicken noodle soup, 
etc.) were not counted in the selection. The classification of 
"noodle consumer" was assigned to individuals who reported 
eating noodles during one day, and other individuals were 
classified as non-consumers. 
The food groups were classified according to USDA food group 
classifications and were regrouped as 38 food groups, including 
noodles (noodles, macaroni, pasta, spaghetti) (Table 1). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis </p>

<p>We examined the associations between noodle consumption 
variables and socioeconomic characteristics such as gender, age, 
income, and ethnicity. All statistical analyses were adjusted for 
the sample weights and the complex sample design of NHANES 
by using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SAS</rs> (release <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">9.13</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc</rs>., Cary, NC) and 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">SUDAAN</rs> (release <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">10.1</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Research Triangle Institute</rs>, Research 
Triangle Park, NC) [31]. All data sets were weighted to be 
nationally representative and standard errors were calculated by 
Taylor linearization variance estimation. Comparison of noodle 
consumption by gender was tested using t-tests, and Bonferroni 
multiple t-tests were used to analyze the differences in noodle 
intake by several ethnicity and income groups. The other ethnic </p>

<p>groups such as "White", "Black", "others" were statistically 
compared with Hispanics. The Chi-square test was used to 
compare noodle consumption with age, gender, income, and 
ethnicity (The result of Chi-square test were not showed in table). </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>The analysis and results based on the NHANES 2001-2002 
data include basic information on noodle consumption as well 
as comparisons across other food groups showing the 
comparative importance of noodles in the diets of Americans. </p>

<p>Consumption of noodles and comparisons across demographic 
groups </p>

<p>To determine the positioning of noodles in the dietary patterns 
of Americans, we investigated the vast quantity of consumed food 
groups using NHANES data. The NHANES 2001-2002 data 
showed that noodle consumers (NC, 23.3%), those who had eaten 
noodles on one day of observed data, included 2,035 persons 
with 975 (47.9%) males and 1,060 females (52.1%). All others 
were classified as non-consumers (noodle non-consumers: NNC, 
76.7%). 
First, we researched the ranking of noodles for noodle 
consumers among the vast quantity intake foodstuffs. When the 
average amounts of consumption for the entire age ranges were 
considered, the ranking of noodles among the vast quantity intake 
foodstuffs was 5th, which included noodles, macaroni, pasta, and 
spaghetti. The consumption amount of non-alcoholic beverages 
was highest, followed by milk, alcoholic beverages, and fruit </p>

<p>juices, in order (Table 2). 
The results of NHANES 2001-2002 showed a total number 
of 2,035 individuals consumed noodles during the survey period. 
Among them there were 975 males and 1,060 females, indicating 
that the noodle consumption frequency of females was higher 
than that of males. The average amount of noodles consumed 
was 304.1 g a day. The average amount of noodles consumed 
by the males was 344.3 g, which is significantly higher than 
that of the females at 268.0 g (P &lt; 0.01). As a result of chi-square 
tests; however, the relationships between gender and noodle 
consumption patterns were not significant. 
Across age groups, the highest noodle consumption was in 9-18 
year-olds, with 353.0 g, followed by 19-50 year-olds with 333.5 
g, 51-70 year-olds with 280.4 g, 71 years old and above with 
252.3 g, and 1-8 year-olds with 221.5 g. In the case of males, 
the highest ratio of noodle consumers was for those between 
19-50 years old. For both males and females, 9-18 year-olds 
consumed the highest amounts of noodles. Except for the 1-8 
year-old consumers, males had higher noodle consumption than 
females across all age levels, where those who were 9-18 years 
old (P &lt; 0.05), 19-50 years old (P &lt; 0.01), and 70 years old and 
above (P &lt; 0.05) had significantly higher intakes compared to 
the females (Table 3). 
Table 3 shows the ranking of quantitatively consumed food 
groups by age. Noodles, including macaroni, pasta, and spaghetti, 
ranked in 5th place for individuals under age 8, 14-18, and 19-50 
years old. Noodles ranked 4 
th for 9-13 year-olds and 9 
th for </p>

<p>individuals over age 51. Population aged over 50 showed lower 
noodle consumption than the other age groups. 
According to gender, noodle intake ranked 5th among the vast 
quantity food items for both males and females, and no difference </p>

<p>in ranking appeared. In terms of quantity, non-alcoholic 
beverages were the most highly consumed food group for both 
men and woman. This was followed in the order of alcoholic 
beverages, milk, and fruit juice for the men, and milk, fruit juice, 
and fruit for the women. 
After comparing the intakes of two age groups of consumers, 
those under 18 years old and 19 years old and above, significant 
relationships between age and noodle consumption (P &lt; 0.0001) 
were found. Comparisons across males and females separately 
also resulted in significant relationships between age and noodle 
consumption. In addition, when comparing intake levels among 
7 age groups: under 1 year old, 1~8 years old, 9~13 years old, 
14~18 years old, 19~50 years old, 51~70 years old, and 71 years 
old and above, significant relationships between age and noodle 
consumption (P &lt; 0.0001) were found. Furthermore, comparisons 
across age levels by dividing the subjects by gender revealed 
significant relationships between age and noodle consumption, 
except for those who were under 1 year old. </p>

<p>Income, ethnicity, and noodle intake </p>

<p>In order to examine the association between noodle consumption 
and the social/economic status, the PIR (Poverty Income Ratio) 
was used. The PIR refers to the poverty level ratio (or poverty 
threshold), which determines income or poverty. If PIR is 1.0, 
for instance, it implies living at the poverty level, and if PIR 
is 0.5, it indicates a living status at half under the poverty level. </p>

<p>According to the U.S Census Bureau, a PIR of 0.5 means 
"severely poor", and a PIR 1.25 means "near poor". In 
accordance with the U.S PIR standards, we distinguished the 
groups into 4 categories: "below 1.0", "1.0-1.84", "1.85-3.5", and 
"above 3.5" to explore the rankings of food consumption by 
income level. For PIRs below 3.5, noodle intake ranked 5th 
without notable differences among the three PIR categories. On 
the other hand, in the higher income group with a PIR above 
3.5, noodle intake ranked 8th and showed differences from other 
the three PIR groups. In the group with PIRs above 3.5, the 
5th and 6th ranked food groups were fruits and vegetables, 
respectively, and the 8th was breads, rolls, pancakes, and waffles 
(Table 4). 
The results of noodle intake by income showed that the ratio 
of noodle consumers was highest in the group with PIRs below 
1.0, but it was concluded that noodle consumption was not 
significantly related to income. The relationships between noodle 
intake amounts and income levels did not show consistent </p>

<p>outcomes (Table 5). 
Differences in food consumption patterns are not only 
influenced by culture but also by ethnicity. In order to examine 
noodle consumption patterns by ethnicity, we categorized the 
groups into Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, 
and others. After analyzing the food groups most consumed 
according to ethnicity, noodles ranked at remarkably different 
positions (Table 6). Noodle intake ranked 8th for Hispanics, 6th 
for non-Hispanic Whites and 5th for non-Hispanic Blacks and 
others. Therefore, non-Hispanic Blacks and others consumed the 
most noodles while Hispanics consumed the least. Different from 
the other ethnic groups, ready-to-eat cereals ranked within the 
top 10 most consumed foods in those classified as "others", 
whereas the consumption of alcoholic beverages was less than 
those of the other ethnic groups. 
The ratios of noodle consumers and intake amounts by 
ethnicity are shown in Table 7. The "other" ethnic group showed 
the highest noodle intake amount with 366.1 g, followed by 
Hispanics with 318.7 g, non-Hispanic whites with 298.6 g, and </p>

<p>non-Hispanic Blacks with 289.5 g. The average noodle intake 
amount of White age 1-8 years old was 196.2 g, which was 
significantly lower than 254.9 g for Hispanics' of the same age 
(P &lt; 0.01). According to the chi-square test results, the 
relationships between ethnicity and noodle intake were not 
significant. </p>

<p>Comparison of food consumption patterns between noodle 
consumers and non-consumers </p>

<p>After dividing the subjects by noodle consumers and 
non-consumers, we compared food consumption amounts for the 
37 food groups for studying food group consumption pattern. 
Based on re-categorized foods, we analyzed additional food 
items that noodles were consumed with, which showed a variety 
of ranges (Table 8). Those who ate only noodles without other 
foods accounted for 64%, while the remaining 36% consumed 
noodles with other foods. Those who dipped noodles in soup 
or mixed them with salad represented 3% and 2.5%, respectively. 
The results also indicate that frozen meals, ready-to-eat cereals, 
sandwiches, dried beans and vegetables, bread/baked products, 
and tortilla products were added when consuming noodle. 
In all age groups, the noodle consumers showed significantly 
higher intakes of beef (P &lt; 0.05), poultry (P &lt; 0.05), sandwiches 
(P &lt; 0.05), legumes (P &lt; 0.01), breads (P &lt; 0.01), ready-to-eat 
cereals (P &lt; 0.05), grain mixtures (P &lt; 0.01), white potatoes (P 
&lt; 0.01), vegetable mixtures (P &lt; 0.05), and nonalcoholic 
beverages compared to the non-consumers. On the other hand, </p>

* Means are significantly different at α = 0.05 by t-test. 
** Means are significantly different at α = 0.01 by t-test. </p>

<p>the noodle consumer group tended to consume more milk, milk 
desserts, fish, tropical fruit, tomatoes, and alcoholic beverages, 
but there were no significant differences except for tomatoes (P 
&lt; 0.05) (Table 9). In the noodle non-consumer group, those 
under 18 years old consumed more food from all food groups. 
The noodle non-consumers had significantly higher intakes of 
cream (P &lt; 0.01), cheeses (P &lt; 0.01), beef (P &lt; 0.05), mixed meat 
with non-meat items (P &lt; 0.01), ready-to-eat cereals (P &lt; 0.05), 
grain mixtures (P &lt; 0.05), fruit juice (P &lt; 0.05), and beverages 
(P &lt; 0.01). The noodle consumers seemed to consume more milk, 
meats, such as lamb, veal, game, and other meats, as well as </p>

<p>tomatoes than the non-consumers (Table 10). In adults older than 
19 years of age, the noodle non-consumers ate significantly more 
sandwiches (P &lt; 0.05), legumes (P &lt; 0.01), breads (P &lt; 0.01), 
grain mixtures (P &lt; 0.05), other fruits (P &lt; 0.05), other vegetables 
(P &lt; 0.05), and white potatoes (P &lt; 0.05). The adult noodle 
consumers had a tendency to consume more milk, yogurt, fish, 
citrus fruit, and tomatoes (Table 11). From the results, the noodle 
consumers consumed more milk, fish, and fruits, and the 
non-consumers consumed more meat, legumes, breads, and 
beverages. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>This study provides information on noodle consumption in the 
United States and shows similarities and differences in the dietary 
sources of those who consume noodles compared to those who 
do not. The research focused on examining noodle consumers, 
understanding any differences in noodle consumption according 
to demographic factors, and analyzing how the food intake of 
noodle consumers differed from that of non-noodle consumers. 
Even though noodles and ramen are not consumed frequently 
by all consumers in the United States, noodles are a main dietary </p>

<p>source, especially for some ethnic groups. Moreover, the noodle 
consumers differed from the non-noodle consumers in their food 
intake. When the two groups were compared, the noodle 
consumers showed food choices that contained more tomatoes 
and less beef, poultry, sandwiches, legumes, breads, ready-to-eat 
cereals, grain mixtures, white potatoes, and vegetable mixtures. 
While a causal relationship was not found, noodle consumption 
was associated with the choice of other food groups that were 
consumed with noodles. 
Age exerted a significant influence on noodle consumption, 
indicating that noodle intake may differ by demographic factors. </p>

<p>Noodle intake also differed by ethnicity, showing cultural 
background to be an important factor for differences in food 
group intake and can affect the nutritional status of different 
ethnic groups. There were significant differences between ethnic 
groups in their rankings of the vast quantity intake foodstuffs 
as compared to other demographic factors such as gender, age, 
and PIR. Differences in noodle consumption among age and 
racial groups explain changes in both food preferences among 
the age groups and the different populations. In the case of the 
"other" ethnic group, including Asians, noodles and ready-to-
eat-cereals held especially high rankings in the vast quantity </p>

<p>intake foodstuffs. These results are due to Asian culture where 
noodles are a staple food. There are, however, a number of 
problems that remain to be explored. In this study, the source 
of data lacked accurate demographic information. NHANES data 
make no distinction between "other" ethnic groups. Therefore, 
it is difficult to research the actual conditions of noodle intake 
in various racial and ethnic groups belonging to the "other" 
category. Another limitation of our analysis is there was no 
consideration for eating location (at home or away from home). 
The current study indicated that individuals consuming more 
noodles showed higher consumption of tomatoes. It is probable </p>

<p>Chin Eun Chung et al. </p>



<p>that the major sources of noodles are pasta and spaghetti. On 
the other hand, the noodle consumers had a tendency of 
consuming less amounts of vegetables, beans and domestic fowl 
as compared to those of non-noodle consumers. The inclusion 
of noodles in planning menus for school lunch programs or food 
assistance programs may further encourage the consumption of 
a varied diet that contains more vegetables, legumes, poultry, 
and beef. In addition, noodle consumers may benefit from new 
recipes in which noodles, particularly nutrient fortified noodles, 
are used in combination with vegetables and legumes. Finally, 
further research is necessary to examine shifts in noodle 
consumption by passage of time and demographic factors. </p>
