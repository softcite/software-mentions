<p>Purpose: The optimal treatment regimen for Mycobacterium avium complex 
(MAC) lung disease has not yet been fully established. We evaluated the efficacy 
of standardized combination antibiotic therapy and the factors that might affect 
unfavorable microbiologic responses in patients with MAC pulmonary disease. 
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study reviewed data from 96 patients 
(56 females; median age 59 years) treated with newly diagnosed MAC lung 
disease between January 2003 and December 2006. Results: All patients received 
standardized combination antibiotic therapy, consisting of clarithromycin, rifam-
picin, and ethambutol. Streptomycin was additionally given in 72 patients (75%) 
for a median duration of 4.5 months. The overall favorable microbiologic response 
rate was 79% (76/96); 20 patients (21%) had unfavorable microbiologic respon-
ses, including failure to sputum conversion (n = 13), relapse (n = 3), and MAC-
related death (n = 4). A positive sputum acid-fast bacillus smear at the start of 
treatment was an independent predictor of an unfavorable microbiologic response. 
Conclusion: Standardized combination antibiotic therapy consisting of clarith-
romycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol with or without initial use of streptomycin is 
effective in treating patients with newly diagnosed MAC lung disease. </p>

<p>institution, we typically prescribe this triple-drug regimen 
for the treatment of MAC lung disease. Furthermore, 
streptomycin has actively been used in patients with radio-
graphically extensive or cavitary disease, especially when 
accompanied by positive sputum smears. 7 In the present 
study, we evaluated the efficacy of this standardized com-
bination antibiotic therapy and the factors that might affect 
unfavorable microbiologic responses in patients with MAC 
pulmonary disease. </p>

<p>Study population 
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all pat-
ients treated for MAC lung disease at the Samsung Medical 
Center (a 1,250-bed referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea) 
between January 2003 and December 2006. During this 
period, 248 patients were newly diagnosed with MAC 
lung disease. All patients met the diagnostic criteria for 
NTM lung disease according to standards set by the 
American Thoracic Society in 1997. 3 No patients had pre-
viously been treated for MAC lung disease before visiting 
our hospital. 
NTM lung disease may progress very slowly. Further-
more, some patients do not require treatment, whereas 
others require combination antibiotic therapy, including 
parenteral agents. After discussing this information with 
patients, we implemented an observation period of at least 
6-12 months with no antibiotic treatment. When the disease 
was clearly recognized as being progressive, patients 
received a standardized combination antibiotic therapy 
following hospitalization. In patients with substantial sym-
ptoms and/or advanced or progressive radiographic abnor-
malities, antibiotic therapy was initiated immediately. 8 
Out of 248 patients with MAC lung disease, 121 patients 
(49%) did not receive antibiotic therapy, and 127 patients 
(51%) received combination antibiotic therapy by the end 
of September 2008. Of these 127 patients who initiated 
combination antibiotic therapy, 31 patients were excluded 
because they had received antibiotic therapy for less than 
12 months at the time of analysis. These included MAC-
unrelated death (n = 3), default (n = 12), transfer out (n = 5), 
and still on treatment (n = 11). However, 3 patients who 
died of MAC lung disease were included in the study, even 
though they were on less than 12 months of antibiotic 
therapy. Therefore, a total of 96 patients were included in 
the study. Permission was obtained from the institutional 
review board of Samsung Medical Center to review and 
publish information from the patients' records. Informed 
consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of 
the study. </p>

<p>Microbiological examination 
Smears for microscopic examination were prepared from 
concentrated specimens and stained with auramine-rhoda-
mine. Smears were then examined under a fluorescent 
microscopy. Samples positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 
were reviewed after staining by using the carbol fuchsin 
staining method. The results of smear microscopy were 
reported semiquantitatively. A positive smear was defined 
as one with &gt; 1 AFB per 100 high-power fields. 9 
Respiratory specimens were decontaminated using N-
acetyl-L-cysteine/2% NaOH, and processed specimens 
were plated on 3% Ogawa medium (Shinyang, Seoul, 
Korea). Inoculated tubes were incubated at 37˚C and then 
inspected weekly for 8 weeks. All AFB isolates were 
assessed to distinguish between M. tuberculosis and NTM 
with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction-
based assay system (MTB-ID, M&amp;D Inc., Wonju, Korea). 
NTM species were identified using a polymerase chain 
reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism 
methods based on the rpoB gene, as described previously 
(Myco-ID, M&amp;D Inc., Wonju, Korea). 2 
Clarithromycin susceptibility was tested at the Korean 
Institute of Tuberculosis. Minimal inhibitory concentra-
tions of clarithromycin were determined using the broth 
microdilution method and interpreted according to the 
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. 10 
Isolates with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 32 
µg/mL or greater were considered resistant. 10 Methods for 
determining broth microdilution minimal inhibitory con-
centration were not established in Korea during the early 
study period, therefore, isolates recovered from only 68 of 
96 patients (71%) could be tested for susceptibility to 
clarithromycin. </p>

<p>Radiological examination 
Chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomo-
graphy (HRCT) findings were classified as showing either 
upper lobe cavitary disease or nodular bronchiectatic 
disease. 11-13 A combination of cavities, consolidation, and 
pleural thickening in the upper lobes was considered upper 
lobe cavitary disease, regardless of whether reticulonodular 
opacities were present. Bilateral bronchiectasis and no-
dular changes that were observed predominantly in the 
middle and lower lung zones without visible cavities in the 
upper lobes were considered nodular bronchiectatic 
disease. When the disease did not belong to either the 
upper lobe cavitary or the nodular bronchiectatic forms, it 
was deemed unclassifiable. 11-13 Initial and available follow-
up HRCT scans were reviewed by two of the authors (Sim 
YS and Park HY). Differences in observed findings were 
resolved by consensus based on five radiographic features: 
cavitary disease, bronchiectasis, nodules, consolidation, </p>

<p>Treatment protocol 
All patients who began antibiotic therapy received a stan-
dardized combination antibiotic therapy consisting of 
clarithromycin (1,000 mg/day), rifampicin (450 mg for 
patients who were &lt; 50 kg or 600 mg for patients who 
were ≥ 50 kg), and ethambutol (25 mg/kg for 2 months, 
then 15 mg/kg/day). 3 These drugs were administered on a 
daily basis. Streptomycin was given intramuscularly at 10-
15 mg/kg (500-1,000 mg) three times per week for the first 
3-6 months, as far as tolerated in patients with AFB smear-
positive sputum or cavitation on chest radiography. This 
regimen usually continued for a total treatment duration of 
24 months, including at least 12 months after sputum 
culture conversion. Sputum smear and culture examina-
tions were performed monthly for the first six months and 
then at two-to three-month intervals until the end of 
treatment. </p>

<p>Assessment of microbiologic responses 
Sputum conversion was defined as three consecutive 
negative cultures within 6 months, with the time of conver-
sion defined as the date of the first negative culture. If 
patient could not expectorate sputum during the treatment 
duration, the sputum was considered to have converted to 
negative. Sputum relapse was defined as two consecutive 
positive cultures after sputum conversion. 15,16 
For the purpose of these analyses, a favorable microbiol-
ogic response was defined as sputum conversion and 
maintenance of negative sputum cultures for more than 12 
months. An unfavorable microbiologic response was 
defined as follows: 1) no sputum conversion, 2) initial 
sputum conversion with sputum relapse, or 3) death related 
to MAC lung disease. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Because a majority of the data did not follow a normal 
distribution, all results presented herein are expressed as 
the median and interquartile range (IQR) or the number 
(percentage) of patients. Categorical variables were 
analyzed using the Pearson χ 2 -test or Fisher's exact test. 
Continuous variables were analyzed using a <rs type="software">Mann-
Whitney U-test</rs>. Multiple logistic regression was per-
formed to assess the effects of independent factors on 
final treatment outcome (excluding uncertain outcomes). 
Variables with a p value less than 0.2 in the univariate 
analysis were considered for the multivariate analysis. All 
P values were two-sided, with p &lt; 0.05 considered to be 
statistically significant. Analyses were executed using 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">PASW</rs>, version <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">17.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc</rs>, Chicago, 
IL, USA) </p>

<p>Patient characteristics 
A total of 96 patients [40 males and 56 females, median 
age 59 years (IQR, 52-68 years)] with MAC lung disease 
who had received combination antibiotic therapy were 
included in the study. None of the 96 patients showed 
positive for HIV. Patient characteristics are summarized in 
Table 1. All patients had respiratory symptoms such as 
purulent sputum (n = 90; 94%), cough (n = 84; 88%), or 
hemoptysis (n = 28; 29%). Etiologic organisms included 
M. intracellulare in 56 patients (58%) and M. avium in 40 
patients (42%). A total of 66 patients (69%) had a positive 
AFB smear at the time of antibiotic therapy initiation. 
Cavities (either single or multiple) were visible on chest 
radiography in 37 patients (39%). Finally, 61 patients 
(64%) had the nodular bronchiectatic form, 25 patients 
(26%) had the upper lobe cavitary form, and 10 patients 
(10%) had unclassifiable variants. 
Drug susceptibility tests were performed as described 
previously on MAC isolates recovered from 68 patients, 
and none of the MAC isolates showed resistance to clari-
thromycin. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>patients (75%) for median 4.5 months (IQR, 3-6 months). 
In all, 28 patients (29%) changed treatment regimens 
due to side-effects. Of these, 23 (24%) stopped taking 
ethambutol due to decreased visual acuity or skin rash after 
a median duration of 6 months (IRQ, 3-12 months). A 
reduction in the dose of clarithromycin to 500 mg/day was 
required in 10 patients due to gastrointestinal disturbance 
after a median duration of 1.6 months (IRQ, 0.2-4.2 
months). Five patients experienced side-effects associated 
with both ethambutol and clarithromycin. 
Surgical resection was performed on eight patients (8%). 
The indications for surgery included a lack of sputum 
conversion (n = 6) and complications such as recurrent 
hemoptysis despite negative sputum conversion (n = 2). 
Pulmonary resections included lobectomy in three patients, 
segmentectomy in two patients, lobectomy plus segmen-
tectomy in one patient, lobectomy plus wedge resection in 
one patient, and pneumonectomy in one patient. Negative 
sputum culture conversion was achieved in six patients. </p>

<p>Clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic responses 
As shown in Table 2, response rates were 81%, based on 
symptoms, and 78% based on HRCT findings. At the start 
of treatment, the median ESR was 45.0 mm/hr (IQR, 28.5-
75.0 mm/hr). ESR levels decreased to a median of 14.0 
mm/hr (IQR, 7.0-34.0 mm/hr) after 12 months of treat-
ment (p &lt; 0.001). 
Among the 96 patients with MAC lung disease who </p>

<p>received combination antibiotic therapy, the initial sputum 
conversion rate was 82% (79/96) and the median time until 
sputum conversion was one month (IQR, 1-2 months). Of 
the 79 patients who showed initial sputum conversion, 61 
patients completed antibiotic treatment and were followed 
for a median of 6.5 months (IQR, 3.0-12.3 months). Spu-
tum relapse occurred after treatment completion in three 
patients (5, 9, and 16 months after treatment completion, 
respectively). Eighteen patients remained on the treatment 
for 19.2 months (IQR, 16.1-22.5 months) at the time of 
analysis. Therefore, the overall favorable microbiologic 
response rate was 79% (76/96). Twenty patients (21%) 
had unfavorable microbiologic responses, including failure 
to sputum conversion (n = 13), relapse (n = 3), and MAC-
related death (n = 4). </p>

<p>Prognostic factors 
Based on the clinical variables included in the univariate 
comparison between favorable and unfavorable micro-
biologic response groups, the final multiple logistic 
regression model revealed that a positive sputum AFB 
smear at the start of treatment (odds ratio, 9.60; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.02-90.19; p = 0.048) was indepen-
dently associated with an unfavorable microbiologic 
response (Table 3). </p>

<p>We investigated the efficacy of standardized combination 
antibiotic therapy for the treatment of patients with MAC 
lung disease. Treatment included oral clarithromycin, 
rifampicin, and ethambutol in combination with the aggres-
sive use of intramuscular streptomycin during the initial 
treatment period. The overall favorable microbiologic 
response rate was 79% (76/96), and we found that a posi-
tive sputum AFB smear at the start of treatment was ind-
ependently associated with an unfavorable microbiologic 
response. 
The optimal treatment regimen for MAC lung disease 
has yet to be fully established. 4,17 Field, et al. 5 published a 
comprehensive literature review of potential treatments for 
MAC lung disease. Overall, treatment outcomes have 
improved with the addition of macrolides to the standard 
regimen; however, the average culture conversion rate 
from 12 studies using the macrolide-containing regimen 
was only about 60%. 5 In our study, the favorable micro-
biologic response rate was 79%. This relatively high treat-
ment response rate is comparable to data from previous 
studies in Japan. 18,19 In these Japanese studies, all patients 
received clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol daily, 
and 65-70% of patients were treated with an aminogly-</p>

<p>coside such as streptomycin or kanamycin for the initial 2-
6 months of therapy. In these studies, long-term conver-
sion rates were more than 80% in patients infected with 
clarithromycin-susceptible strains. 18,19 
The role of aminoglycoside as a companion drug is 
somewhat unclear. Streptomycin may be useful in patients 
who have a substantial number of extracellular organisms 
against which streptomycin is highly active. Included in 
this group are patients with radiographically extensive or 
cavitary disease and those with strongly positive sputum 
AFB smears. A recent prospective randomized controlled 
study of the clinical efficacy of streptomycin in the treat-
ment of MAC lung disease revealed that sputum conver-
sion rates at the completion of therapy were significantly 
higher in the streptomycin group who received streptomy-
cin intramuscularly three times per week for the initial 3 
months of therapy in combination with clarithromycin, 
rifampicin, and ethambutol. 16 In our study, streptomycin 
was given for a median of 4.5 months (IQR, 3-6 months) 
in 72 patients (75%). The use of this aggressive treatment 
strategy depended largely on the patients' characteristics. 
We used streptomycin in patients with a positive sputum 
smear and/or cavitary disease. Among the 96 patients, 66 
(69%) had a positive AFB smear and 37 (39%) had a cavity 
(or cavities) visible on chest radiography at the start of 
antibiotic therapy. 
Some small-scale studies suggest that a three-times-
weekly regimen that includes clarithromycin or azithromy-
cin may be as effective as a daily regimen. 20,21 However, a 
large prospective trial showed that a three-times-weekly 
regimen was not effective in producing negative culture </p>

<p>conversion. 14 Negative culture conversion was achieved in 
only 13% of patients (4% in the cavitary disease group and 
24% in the non-cavitary disease group), although culture 
improvement rates, i.e., reduction in colony counts, were 
44% (20% in the cavitary disease group and 71% in the 
non-cavitary disease group). 14 The Korean Academy of 
Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases recommends a 
daily antibiotic therapy for MAC lung disease. 6 Therefore, 
all patients in our study who required antibiotic therapy 
were given a daily regimen according to the national 
guidelines. 
With respect to treatment duration, it is usually recom-
mended that antibiotic therapy be continued for 12 months 
once the patient converts to a negative culture. 3,4 The over-
all treatment period in our study was typically 24 months. 
In some studies, however, high relapse rates have been 
reported despite long-term antibiotic therapy of ≥ 24 
months. 22 Genotyping research has demonstrated that in 
patients with nodular bronchiectatic forms of MAC lung 
disease, multiple and/or repeated infections and frequent 
recurrence may be due to reinfection with a genetically 
different strain or relapse with the original strain. 23,24 Recent 
studies have provided evidence that a patient's home envi-
ronment, e.g., bathrooms, may serve as a continuing source 
of pulmonary infection caused by MAC. 25,26 When patients 
repeatedly inhale MAC organisms during treatment, the 
efficacy of antibiotic therapy may be reduced. Future 
studies examining the clinical relevance of these situations 
should be performed. 
As the American Thoracic Society guidelines pointed 
out, one of the most difficult questions may be when to </p>

The decision to begin treatment is made by weighing the 
anticipated benefits and risks. The decision is relatively 
easy in patients with profound symptoms and destructive 
lesions; however, the decision is difficult in patients with 
mild symptoms and non-advanced lesions. Factors that 
must be considered include the patients' age, whether the 
symptoms are mild or equivocal, and the presence of 
comorbities. 27 In all cases, close observation is necessary if 
treatment is not performed. 
There are few studies in which patients with certain 
characteristics show disease progression. One study from 
Japan found that 60% of patients showed disease progres-
sion and 40% of patients were stable during a mean 
observation period of 28 months. 28 In the present study, the 
conversion rate was significantly higher in smear-negative 
cases, suggesting that the earlier the treatment starts, the 
better the outcomes will be. However, prolonged antibiotic 
treatment may not be necessary in patients in the early 
stages of infection. This is a real challenge to clinicians in 
daily practice. Further studies are needed to determine 
when to start antibiotic therapy. 
The present study has many limitations that are inherent 
to all retrospective, noncomparative studies conducted at a 
single center. We did not calculate appropriate power or 
sample size for this study at the design stage. Our restros-
pective study may have less power (less than 80%) to 
detect predictors of favorable responses if the expected 
proportion of favorable response was 0.2, and 95% of the 
patients with the favorable category of a predictor to favo-
rable response resulted in favorable response, and the 
candidate predictors are not correlated. As observed therapy 
was not performed directly for patients with NTM lung 
disease, the possibility of poor compliance of treatment 
regimen could not be completely excluded in this retros-
pective study. In addition, the present study included pat-
ients with newly diagnosed MAC lung disease, and no 
patients were infected with clarithromycin-resistant MAC 
isolates. Therefore, our high treatment response rates may 
not be generalized to patients with a previous treatment 
history or those infected with clarithromycin-resistant 
isolates. Most importantly, we cannot determine whether a 
favorable microbiologic response will continue. Of the 76 
patients who achieved culture-negative sputum for more 
than 12 months, 61 completed their antibiotic therapy and 
underwent follow-up for a median of only 6.5 months. 
Longer follow-up times are necessary to fully assess 
disease relapse over time. 
In conclusion, standardized combination antibiotic 
therapy consisting of clarithromycin, rifampicin, and 
ethambutol with or without initial use of streptomycin is 
effective in treating patients with newly diagnosed MAC </p>

<p>lung disease. Further studies are needed to address several 
issues regarding optimal timing of antibiotic therapy, 
treatment regimens, and treatment duration. </p>
