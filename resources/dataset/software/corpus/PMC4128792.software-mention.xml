<p>Abstract: Although the health effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) on the respiratory 
system have been reported, the fate, potential toxicity, and mechanisms in biological cells of these 
particles, as related to particle size and surface characteristics, have not been well elucidated. To 
determine the physicochemical properties of ZnONPs that govern cytotoxicity, we investigated 
the effects of size, electronic properties, zinc concentration, and pH on cell viability using human 
alveolar-basal epithelial A549 cells as a model. We observed that a 2-hour or longer exposure to 
ZnONPs induced changes in cell viability. The alteration in cell viability was associated with the 
zeta potentials and pH values of the ZnONPs. Proteomic profiling of A549 exposed to ZnONPs for 
2 and 4 hours was used to determine the biological mechanisms of ZnONP toxicity. p53-pathway 
activation was the core mechanism regulating cell viability in response to particle size. Activation 
of the Wnt and TGFβ signaling pathways was also important in the cellular response to ZnONPs 
of different sizes. The cadherin and Wnt signaling pathways were important cellular mechanisms 
triggered by surface differences. These results suggested that the size and surface characteristics 
of ZnONPs might play an important role in their observed cytotoxicity. This approach facilitates 
the design of more comprehensive systems for the evaluation of nanoparticles. 
Nanoparticles (NPs) are used in various commercial products and for novel applications 
in sunscreens, engineering, and biomedicine. However, the fate, potential toxicity, and 
cellular mechanisms of these particles are not well understood. Human contact with 
NPs is increasing, and regulatory guidelines are not presently available. Therefore, the 
development of reliable high-throughput in vitro test systems for use in product design 
and for cytotoxicity evaluations would be advantageous for assessing efficiency and 
for the extrapolation of NP effects to humans. Previous in vitro observations have been 
based on known toxicity mechanisms; 
1,2 however, it is unclear whether these experi-
ments provide sufficient toxicological information for comprehensive assessment of 
the potential toxicity of NPs. 
Zinc oxide NPs (ZnONPs) are produced for many applications, such as antimicrobi-
als 
3 and cancer therapy. 
4 For example, specifically designed ZnONPs can enhance the 
ability of NPs to target specific types of cancer cells, pass through physiological barriers, 
and interact with tumor sites. 
4 An increasing number of studies propose that the com-
mon pathogenic mechanisms of ZnONPs, such as cell death, are related to oxidative 
stress imbalances. 
5,6 Previous studies have shown that ZnONPs are more toxic than 
macrosized fractions. 
7 The electrostatic nature of NPs is also an important characteristic, </p>

<p>as electrostatic interactions between charged NPs and target 
cells likely play an important role in the regulation of par-
ticle uptake by cells. 
8,9 Doping ZnONPs with metals, such as 
aluminum (Al-ZnONPs), can specifically enhance the NPs' 
electrical and optical properties. 
10 Because transition metals 
can regulate redox-cycling cascades, transition metal-doped 
ZnONPs have the potential to improve therapeutic tech-
niques. 
11 Certain studies suggest that the toxicity of ZnONPs 
may be due to the zinc ion; 
12,13 however, others indicate that a 
significant association between ZnONPs and zinc ion toxic-
ity does not exist. 
14 In addition, previous studies have shown 
that intracellular pH increases during cell-cycle progression 
and proliferation. 
15,16 Therefore, the alteration in pH could 
be associated with electrostatic interactions with charged 
particles at the cell membrane. 
17 Given these hypothesized 
mechanisms, tailoring the size and surface characteristics 
of ZnONPs is expected to influence their cytotoxicity, and 
these will likely be important characteristics to consider when 
developing cancer therapies. 
High-throughput approaches, such as toxicoproteomics, 
which includes proteomics and metabonomics, have the 
potential to provide an unbiased evaluation of the biologi-
cal response of an organism or a cell to adverse stressors. </p>

<p>18 </p>

<p>Therefore, the use of such a platform as proteomics can 
determine all relevant toxicity pathways when combined with 
bioinformative techniques.

such as cell supernatants,

<p>and blood samples, 
21 can be measured for several purposes. 
Okoturo-Evans et al investigated the toxicological mecha-
nism of silicon dioxide NPs in lung cells, 
2 and suggested that 
proteomic approaches would facilitate the design of a more 
focused test system for the evaluation of NP toxicity. 
ZnO is generally recognized as a safe material by the US 
Food and Drug Administration, but this designation most 
commonly refers to materials larger than nanoscale fractions. 
As a result, a comprehensive evaluation of ZnONP toxicity 
is required, as well as an assessment of particle effects on 
human health. In this study, we explored the feasibility of 
using proteomics to investigate changes in the viability of 
NP-exposed human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells as </p>

<p>a basis for the development of high-throughput screens and 
for the more focused assessment of differences in the size 
and surface characteristics of ZnONPs. Finally, based on 
the identified proteins, we analyzed the biological processes 
involved in ZnONP-induced cell death. </p>

<p>The sources and physical properties of the ZnONPs and 
Al-ZnONPs used in this study are listed in Table 1. All of the 
other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, 
MO, USA), unless the source is explicitly stated. </p>

<p>Field-emission scanning electron 
microscopy and energy-dispersive 
X-ray microanalysis </p>

<p>To investigate the physicochemical changes in ZnONPs and 
Al-ZnONPs pre-and postsuspension in dH 2 O or 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS), field-emission scanning electron micros-
copy (FE-SEM; Inspect™ 2100; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and 
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis were used in 
this study. Samples were vortexed and sonicated for 10 min-
utes and then lyophilized for the FE-SEM and EDX analyses. 
The preparation protocols for the FE-SEM and EDX analyses 
have been previously reported. 
22 The samples were adhered 
onto 12 mm carbon sticky tabs, which were fixed on 13 mm 
aluminum SEM stubs. The samples were coated with platinum 
to an average thickness of 10 nm using a sputter coater and 
then imaged. FE-SEM was operated at an accelerating volt-
age of 15 kV using a 2.5 spot size. Elemental analysis was 
performed using the EDX Genesis microanalysis system. </p>

<p>Proteomic profiling of alteration in cell viability by ZnONPs </p>

<p>of the samples were also determined using the Zetasizer Nano 
ZS. Changes in the solution pH levels were determined using 
a pH meter. To determine zinc concentrations, the samples 
were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm (500 g) for 10 minutes and 
then filtered using a 0.45 μm polyvinylidene difluoride 
filter (Chrom Tech, Apple Valley, MN, USA). 
23 A flame 
atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAnalyst™ 800; 
PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine 
the concentrations of zinc ions leached from the ZnONPs. </p>

<p>cell culture and treatment </p>

<p>Human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells were obtained 
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, 
VA, USA) and cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 
(RPMI) medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin, and strep-
tomycin. There was no endotoxin detected in the ZnONPs 
or Al-ZnONPs (Pierce LAL chromogenic endotoxin 
quantitation kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
USA). To investigate NP-induced changes in cell viability, 
A549 cells were incubated with 0, 20, 50, 150, 300, and 
500 μg/mL ZnONPs or Al-ZnONPs at 37°C for 0-48 hours 
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . The ZnONPs 
and Al-ZnONPs were not washed before the cell treatments. 
Each experiment was conducted in quadruplicate. </p>

<p>real-time monitoring of cell viability 
using the xcelligence system </p>

<p>To investigate the real-time viability of A549 cells after 
exposure to ZnONPs or Al-ZnONPs, the xCELLigence 
system (Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was used. 
The principle of the system has been reported previously. </p>

<p>24 </p>

<p>Briefly, the xCELLigence system monitors cellular events 
in real time by recording the electrical impedance that 
correlates with the cell number, morphology, and viability 
in a given culture well of an E-plate. The concentration of 
A549 cells was adjusted to 100,000 cells per 200 μL and 
loaded into the wells of microtiter E-plates (96 wells) after 
obtaining the background impedance of the plates. The cell 
background impedance was monitored every 5 minutes 
for the first 20 hours. The RPMI medium was removed 
before adding 200 μL of each ZnONP or Al-ZnONP 
sample, prepared in media at particle concentrations of 0, 
20, 50, 150, 300, and 500 μg/mL. For the next 48 hours, 
cell impedance was monitored, and the electrical imped-
ance was calculated using the RTCA-integrated software 
of the xCELLigence system. The electrical impedance was 
expressed as a dimensionless parameter, termed the cell 
index (cell-viability index). </p>

<p>Characterization of proteomic profiling </p>

<p>To investigate global protein expression in A549 cells after 
exposure to 20 μg/mL ZnONPs or Al-ZnONPs, supernatant 
fractions were collected after 2 and 4 hours of exposure. 
The preparation of samples for proteomic analyses has been 
reported previously. 
19 Briefly, the supernatants were diluted 
with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The samples were 
denatured and reduced with 8 M urea/10 mM dithiothreitol 
and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide. The samples were 
then digested with trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate 
and desalted by C18 columns. The tryptic peptides were then 
analyzed using a Q Exactive™ mass spectrometer (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Dionex UltiMate 
® 3000 
RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were 
separated by liquid chromatography using C18 columns 
(75×150 mm, 2 μm, Dionex Acclaim 
® PepMap™ RSLC; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific). The separation conditions have 
been described previously. 
19 Full mass spectrometry (MS) 
scans were performed using ranges of m/z 380-2,000, m/z 
380-600, m/z 600-800, m/z 800-1,200, and m/z 1,200-2,000, 
and the ten most intense ions from the MS scans were selected 
for MS/MS scans. The raw data were processed into peak lists 
using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Proteome Discoverer</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">1.3</rs> for Mascot database search-
ing (Matrix Science, London, UK) and National Center for 
Biotechnology Information UniProt database prediction and 
literature searching. The search parameters included variable 
modifications for deamidation (NQ), oxidation (M), and a 
fixed modification for carbamidomethyl (C). The maximum 
mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and to 
0.05 Da for fragment ions. </p>

<p>Protein functional analyses </p>

<p>The expressed proteins were subjected to functional pathway 
analyses using the PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough 
Evolutionary Relationships) classification system (http:// 
www.pantherdb.org) to determine the biological context of 
the identified proteins. 
25 The UniProt accession database was 
used to access the expressed proteins identified in this study. 
The identified proteins were uploaded and mapped against the 
Homo sapiens reference data set to extract and summarize the 
functional annotations associated with individual proteins or 
groups of proteins and to identify the biological processes, 
molecular functions, and pathways for each data set. </p>

<p>ZnONPs, including ZnONP20 (average diameter of 
20 nm), ZnONP90 (average diameter of 90-210 nm), and 
Al-ZnONP20 (average diameter of 20-40 nm), were used to 
investigate the effects of the size and surface characteristics 
of ZnONPs on a biological system. The supplier provided the </p>

<p>basic characteristics of the ZnONPs (Table 1). Morphological 
and elemental changes in the ZnONPs pre-and postsuspen-
sion in dH 2 O and 10% FBS-containing medium (Figure 1) 
were examined first. We found that ZnONP20, ZnONP90, 
and Al-ZnONP20 were regular in shape, and significant 
morphological change did not occur when the ZnONPs were 
suspended in dH 2 O or 10% FBS-containing medium. The 
EDX results did not show significant difference in Zn and O 
elements between ZnONP20 and ZnONP90 when suspended 
in dH 2 O (86%-93% for Zn and 4%-7% for O) or 10% FBS-
containing medium (86%-91% for Zn and 5%-8% for O).

<p>1% Al, 85%-86% Zn, and 7% O when suspended in dH 2 O 
or 10% FBS-containing medium. 
To understand the physicochemical characteristics of the 
ZnONPs, we next investigated the hydrodynamic diameters 
of ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and Al-ZnONP20 at 20-500 μg/mL 
in 10% FBS-containing medium over 48 hours. The results of 
this analysis, as shown in Figure 2, indicate that the hydrody-
namic diameters of the ZnONPs were 105 (at 20 μg/mL) to 
522 (at 500 μg/mL) nm for ZnONP20, 98 (at 20 μg/mL) to 
486 (at 500 μg/mL) nm for ZnONP90, and 53 (at 20 μg/mL) 
to 967 (at 500 μg/mL) nm for Al-ZnONP20 for 48 hours. </p>

<p>The hydrodynamic diameters of the ZnONPs increased 
over time, especially after 24-hour exposure (P0.05, 
except for ZnONP20 and ZnONP90 at 20 μg/mL). The zeta 
potentials of the ZnONPs were determined, as shown in 
Figure 2. The zeta potentials of ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and 
Al-ZnONP20 were between -17.56 and -29.56 mV, -26.51 
and -34.99 mV, and -21.62 and -29.25, respectively, 
compared with -18.17 mV for 10% FBS (vehicle control, 
0 μg/mL). The absolute value of zeta-potential values 
increased over time during the 48-hour period (P0.05), 
except for ZnONP20 at 150 and 300 μg/mL. A slight increase </p>

persed in the FBS solution (Figure 2, P0.05), except for 
ZnONP90 at 150 μg/mL. We observed that the pH values 
were 8.03-8.24 for ZnONP20, 7.92-8.16 for ZnONP90, 
and 7.92-8.32 for Al-ZnONP20. Zn leaching from these 
particles during the 48-hour period was also investigated. 
We observed that the concentrations of Zn that leached from 
ZnONP20 significantly increased over time (P0.05) and 
also demonstrated a significant dose-dependent response 
(P0.05), as shown in Figure 2. The concentrations of Zn 
that leached from ZnONP90 and Al-ZnONP20 increased 
to a peak at 0.5 hour and remained stable throughout the 
remaining incubation time. </p>

We found that ZnONP exposure reduced cell viability sig-
nificantly in a dose-and time-dependent manner compared 
with the controls (P0.05), especially when exposed to 
150, 300, or 500 μg/mL. Notably, 20 μg/mL ZnONP20, 
ZnONP90, or Al-ZnONP20 slightly decreased cell viabil-
ity over time. Additionally, we observed that cell viability 
slightly increased at 2 hours postexposure in cells treated 
with any of the three particle types, followed by a continuous 
decrease in viability after 4 hours' exposure. The ranking 
of cell viability among these ZnONPs was Al-ZnONP20  
ZnONP90  ZnONP20 at 500 μg/mL. </p>

<p>Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine the 
correlations between cell viability and the physicochemi-
cal changes in the ZnONPs (hydrodynamic diameter, zeta 
potential, zinc ion release, and pH) during a 48-hour exposure 
(Figure 3). Significant positive correlations were observed 
between cell viability and the zeta potentials of ZnONP20 
(r=0.89, P0.01) and Al-ZnONP20 (r=0.80, P0.05). Addi-
tionally, the alteration of cell viability by ZnONP20 was negatively 
correlated with pH (r=-0.83, P0.05). Statistically significant 
correlations were not observed between cell viability and hydro-
dynamic diameters or zinc ion release among these ZnONPs. </p>

<p>To understand the biological differences between a 2-hour 
(a slight increase in cell viability) and a 4-hour (a significant </p>

<p>decrease in cell viability) exposure to ZnONP20, ZnONP90, 
or Al-ZnONP20, we explored the proteomic profile of the 
proteins released from cells incubated with 20 μg/mL NPs, 
a concentration that produced a significant decrease in cell 
viability. In total, 87 proteins were identified in the control </p>

ZnONP20, ZnONP90, or al-ZnONP20 for 48 hours. 
Notes: The index of cell viability increased between 0 and 2 hours of exposure to 
the ZnONPs, even at a relatively high mass concentration (500 μg/ml). Notably, 
cell death occurred after a 2-hour exposure, reducing the cell-viability index. Time-
dependent associations between cell viability and the physicochemistry of ZnONPs 
were determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Significant positive 
correlations were observed between cell viability and\zeta potentials of ZnONP20 
(r=0.89, P0.01) and al-ZnONP20 (r=0.80, P0.05). The alteration of cell viability 
by ZnONP20 was negatively correlated with ph (r=-0.83, P0.05). statistical 
associations were not observed between cell viability and hydrodynamic diameter 
or zinc ion (zinc ion concentration).

<p>cells, whereas 87, 70, and 94 proteins were identified after a 
2-hour exposure to ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and Al-ZnONP20, 
respectively. A total of 69, 85, and 96 proteins were identi-
fied after a 4-hour exposure to ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and 
Al-ZnONP20, respectively. These proteins are listed at http:// 
www.dovepress.com/cr_data/supplementary_file_66651. 
pdf. To identify the proteins expressed after ZnONP20, 
ZnONP90, and Al-ZnONP20 exposure, the overlaps in pro-
tein profiles between the control and ZnONP20, ZnONP90, 
and Al-ZnONP20 between 2 and 4 hours were examined </p>

<p>(Figure 4). There were eleven, three, and 18 proteins unique 
to cells exposed for 2 hours to ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and Al-
ZnONP20, respectively (Table 2). There were eight, 12, and 
20 proteins unique to cells exposed for 4 hours to ZnONP20, 
ZnONP90, and Al-ZnONP20, respectively (Table 2). 
MS-based functional pathway analyses were performed 
using the proteins unique to ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and Al-
ZnONP20 exposures to understand their biological context. 
PANTHER analysis was initially used to examine protein 
functions in biological processes (Figure 4). We observed that </p>

<p>Proteomic profiling of alteration in cell viability by ZnONPs </p>

<p>only proteins involved in cellular component organization 
(4% for ZnONP20), the generation of precursor metabolites 
and energy (1.4% for Al-ZnONP20), and system processes 
(6% for ZnONP20) were present after a 2-hour exposure, 
whereas only proteins involved in apoptosis (7.4% for 
ZnONP20 exposure and 6.9% for ZnONP90 exposure), the 
cell cycle (7.4% for ZnONP20 and 3.4% for ZnONP90), 
cellular component organization (3.4% for ZnONP90), 
developmental processes (5.2% for ZnONP90), homeostatic 
processes (1.7% for ZnONP90), the regulation of biologi-
cal processes (1.7% for ZnONP90), reproduction (1.7% for 
ZnONP90), system processes (3.4% for ZnONP90), and </p>

<p>transport (5.2% for ZnONP90) were present after a 4-hour 
exposure. 
The molecular functions of these proteins unique to 
ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and Al-ZnONP20 exposure were also 
determined (Figure 4). We observed that only antioxidant 
activity (5.9% for ZnONP20), structural molecule activity 
(5.9% for ZnONP20), transcription-regulator activity (2.9% for 
Al-ZnONP20), and transporter activity (2.9% for Al-ZnONP20) 
were present after a 2-hour exposure. Notably, catalytic activ-
ity (26.1%), ion-channel activity (4.3), receptor activity (17.4), 
structural molecule activity (4.3%), and transporter activity (8.7) 
were only observed after a 4-hour exposure to ZnONP90. </p>

<p>Proteomic profiling of size and surface-
chemistry effects on cell viability </p>

<p>To understand the effects of particle size on cell viability, 
MS-based functional pathway analyses were performed on 
the proteins unique to ZnONP20 (87 proteins for 2 hours 
and 69 proteins for 4 hours) and ZnONP90 (70 proteins for 
2 hours and 85 proteins for 4 hours) exposure to understand 
their biological context. PANTHER analysis was also used to 
determine protein functions in cellular pathways (Figure 5). 
We observed that proteins involved in the blood-coagulation 
cascade (14.3%), the cadherin signaling pathway (14.3%), the 
circadian clock system (14.3%), the gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone-receptor pathway (14.3%), inflammation mediated 
by chemokine and cytokine signaling (14.3%), the p53 path-
way (14.3%), and the Wnt signaling pathway (14.3%) were 
expressed in response to a 2-hour exposure to ZnONP. The 
blood-coagulation cascade (33.3%), the gonadotropin releas-
ing hormone receptor pathway (33.3%) and the TGFβ signal-
ing pathway (33.3%) were present after a 2-hour exposure 
to ZnONP90. A 4-hour exposure to ZnONP20 activated the 
apoptosis signaling pathway (25%) and blood-coagulation 
cascade (75%), whereas a 4-hour ZnONP90 exposure 
induced proteins active in glycolysis (25%), Huntington's </p>

<p>disease (25%), the integrin signaling pathway (25%), and 
the p53 pathway (25%). 
We next investigated the effects of particle-surface char-
acteristics on cell viability (Figure 5). MS-based functional 
pathway analyses were performed on the proteins unique 
to ZnONP20 (87 proteins at 2 hours and 69 proteins at 
4 hours) and Al-ZnONP20 (94 proteins at 2 hours and 
96 proteins at 4 hours) exposure to understand their biological 
context. We observed that the proteins involved in the blood-
coagulation cascade (40%), the cadherin signaling pathway 
(20%), Huntington's disease (20%), and the Wnt signaling 
pathway (20%) were present 2 hours after ZnONP20 expo-
sure, whereas the proteins involved in the blood-coagulation 
cascade (20%), cytoskeletal regulation by Rho guanosine 
triphosphatase (10%), Huntington's disease (10%), the 
insulin/IGF pathway-mitogen-activated protein kinase 
kinase/MAP kinase cascade (10%), the insulin/IGF path-
way-protein kinase B signaling cascade/integrin signaling 
pathway (10%), the ionotropic glutamate-receptor pathway/ 
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 and 4 signaling pathway 
(10%), and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling 
pathway (10%) were found after a 2-hour Al-ZnONP20 
exposure. Only proteins involved in the blood-coagulation </p>

<p>Proteomic profiling of alteration in cell viability by ZnONPs </p>

<p>cascade (100%) were identified after a 4-hour exposure to 
ZnONP20. Proteins involved in the Alzheimer's disease-
presenilin pathway (10%), the blood-coagulation cascade 
(10%), the cadherin signaling pathway (10%), glycolysis 
(20%), Huntington's disease (10%), the integrin signaling 
pathway (10%), the p53 pathway (10%), the pentose-phos-
phate pathway (10%), and the Wnt signaling pathway (10%) 
were present after a 4-hour exposure to Al-ZnONP20. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>With regard to the toxicology of ZnONPs, smaller particles, 
which have a greater surface area per unit mass than do larger 
particles, may be associated with higher bioreactivity. Addi-
tionally, differences in the surface characteristics of particles 
may also play important roles in the regulation of cellular 
bioreactivity. 
23 For these reasons, the present study explored 
the feasibility of using proteomics to investigate cell viability 
in alveolar epithelial cells as a basis for the development of 
high-throughput screens and more focused assessments of the 
effects of size and surface characteristics of ZnONPs. 
Physicochemical characterization in toxicological experi-
ments is a key step in NP toxicological testing. Considering 
the significance in determining the biological outcomes of 
ZnONP exposure and how important modifications can create 
"safe-by-design" nanoproducts, we investigated the dose-
dependent and time-dependent nature of the physicochemis-
try of ZnONPs. In this study, two different sizes of ZnONPs 
(ZnONP20 and ZnONP90) were used to investigate size 
effects, and the similarly sized ZnONP20 and Al-ZnONP20, 
but having different electrical and electronic properties, were 
used to investigate surface effects. No significant change in 
morphology was observed among these ZnONPs when dis-
persed in water or FBS solution. Previous studies reported that 
serum proteins act as an excellent dispersant for ZnONPs in 
biological solutions, 
14,23 which is consistent with our finding 
that the addition of FBS dispersed ZnONPs well at various 
mass concentrations (20-500 μg/mL). However, dispersion 
in FBS-containing medium was reduced over time. We found 
reaggregation of ZnONPs occurred after 6 hours, especially at 
higher mass concentrations. Additionally, the hydrodynamic 
diameters of ZnONP20 and ZnONP90 partially overlapped, 
which may have contributed to the reaggregation of the par-
ticles over 48 hours. The zeta-potential values also slightly 
decreased over time. Taken together, these results suggest 
that serum proteins may be a good dispersant for ZnONPs, 
but the dispersive effects are only maintained for a short 
time, after which aggregation/agglomeration recurs. The 
use of other ZnONPs with distinct size distributions may be </p>

<p>required in future studies. The stabilization of ZnONPs in 
serum primarily occurs through protein adsorption and the 
resulting net surface charge, as reported by Wells et al. </p>

<p>16 </p>

<p>The alterations in the zeta potentials of the ZnONPs may 
result from the change in pH over a 48-hour period, which 
is supported by the work of Shahmoradi et al. 
17 The ZnONPs 
leached Zn into the solution, and relatively stable Zn levels 
were maintained for 48 hours, which is similar to the findings 
of our previous study. </p>

<p>23 </p>

<p>Cell viability is a common indicator in toxicological 
testing; however, alterations in cell viability also relate to 
the cutoff time. To obtain a better understanding of dose-
and time-dependent changes in cell viability, the real-time 
viability of A549 cells after exposure to ZnONP20, 
ZnONP90, or Al-ZnONP20 was monitored. We observed that 
the index of cell viability increased between 0 and 2 hours 
of exposure to the ZnONPs, even at a relatively high mass 
concentration (500 μg/mL). Notably, cell death occurred 
after a 2-hour exposure, reducing the cell-viability index. 
This finding suggests that a 2-hour exposure may be the 
longest that can be used for nanotoxicology testing of such 
particles as ZnONPs. To understand how NPs alter cellular 
bioreactivity before and after the 2-hour cutoff time point, 
protein profiling and the biological context of the identified 
proteins were determined. Proteins involved in apoptosis, the 
cell cycle, and reproduction were each present after exposure 
to ZnONP20 or ZnONP90 for 4 hours. Proteins involved 
in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy were 
characterized at 2 hours postexposure to Al-ZnONP20. Our 
findings were consistent with previous reports that ZnONPs 
induced cell death via apoptotic pathways 
12,26 and alterations 
in the cell cycle. 
27,28 The different biological processes acti-
vated in response to ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and especially 
Al-ZnONP20 could have resulted from particle-size and 
surface differences. 
To determine the effects of the size and surface charac-
teristics of ZnONPs on biological processes, protein-profile 
comparisons between ZnONP20 and ZnONP90 and between 
ZnONP20 and Al-ZnONP20 after a 2-hour or 4-hour expo-
sure were performed. We found that the proteins of the 
cadherin signaling pathway, the circadian clock system, 
inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signal-
ing, the p53 pathway, and the Wnt signaling pathway were 
present after a 2-hour exposure to ZnONP20. In contrast, 
proteins associated with the apoptosis signaling pathway and 
the blood-coagulation cascade were present after a 4-hour 
exposure. However, the TGFβ signaling pathway was only 
identified after a 2-hour exposure to ZnONP90, whereas </p>

<p>glycolysis, Huntington's disease, the integrin signaling 
pathway, and the p53 pathway were identified after a 4-hour 
exposure to ZnONP90. These findings suggest that smaller 
ZnONPs may have more acute toxic biological effects, 
such as activation of cell death, than do larger ZnONPs, 
but the results could also reflect the corresponding numbers 
of ZnONPs per unit mass. 
29 Additionally, the cells showed 
activation of distinct biological pathways in response to 
ZnONPs of different sizes. The proteins of the Wnt signaling 
pathway, for example, were only expressed after exposure 
to ZnONP20, and the TGFβ signaling pathway was only 
identified after exposure to ZnONP90. The p53-pathway 
proteins were present at 2 hours of ZnONP20 and 4 hours 
of ZnONP90 treatment, suggesting that the p53 pathway 
could be the core mechanism responsible for zinc-based 
NP-induced cell death. 
26 We further showed that the WNT 
signaling pathway and the TGFβ signaling pathway regulated 
different cellular fates in cells treated with ZnONP20 and 
ZnONP90, respectively. The Wnt and TGFβ pathways are 
crucial mechanisms for controlling cell differentiation and 
cell fate. Cho et al indicated that expression of TGFβ was 
associated with ZnONP exposure. </p>

<p>30 </p>

<p>With regard to the differences in surface effects between 
ZnONP20 and Al-ZnONP20, our results demonstrated that the 
cadherin signaling pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway 
were active after a 2-hour ZnONP20 exposure and a 4-hour 
Al-ZnONP20 exposure. This result shows that cell fate and 
cell integration are important biological responses to smaller 
ZnONPs. Notably, the delayed biological effects could have 
resulted from the surface characteristics of the two ZnONPs. 
Therefore, an investigation of the correlations between the 
physicochemical parameters and cell death was conducted. 
Our results further showed that cytotoxicity might have been 
associated with zeta potential and pH. It is known that Al dop-
ants in ZnO can significantly modify the electronic properties 
of the material. Xu et al reported that Al-ZnONP was more 
conductive than nondoped ZnO and that the electronic prop-
erties correlated with cytotoxicity. 
31 Furthermore, the higher 
positive charge could be more toxic to cells. 
5 The surface 
differences between ZnONP20 and Al-ZnONP20 were also 
related to the pH, which is supported by work from Chusuei 
et al. 
32 Previous studies showed that Zn ion plays an important 
role in the regulation of ZnONP toxicity; 
30,33 however this 
association was not observed in our study. The difference may 
be due to the leached Zn ion reaching a plateau for 0.5 hour, 
following a stable Zn ion level over 48 hours. Real-time 
alteration in cell viability caused by different concentrations 
of Zn ion should be investigated in future work. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>In conclusion, we have shown that the size and surface char-
acteristics of ZnONPs play important roles in the regulation 
of cell viability, which was inferred from proteomic analyses. 
We also provide a better understanding of the biological 
effects of ZnONP exposure. Regarding the toxicity of surface 
properties, zeta potential and pH may be crucial character-
istics for cell viability, which needs to be investigated in 
future work. Surface area is considered to be a determinant 
for nanotoxicity, 
34 which needs to be investigated in future 
work. Also, unisize isotopic ZnONPs may be used to clarify 
the size effects and surface effects on cell viability. Our 
findings have significant implications for discovering the 
biological responses responsible for the effects of ZnONPs at 
the molecular level, and continued work is required to more 
thoroughly elucidate the mechanisms involved. </p>
