<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Purpose: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] varies greatly with season at northern 
latitudes. The purpose of this study was to determine if the seasonal variations in 
serum total 25(OH)D are followed by a concomitant variation in free 25(OH)D or if the 
variation is damped by alterations in the binding capacity of DBP. 
Methods: Serum was collected from 540 healthy blood donors (60% men; mean age 
41 ± 13 years) during 12 months and analyzed for total 25(OH)D, directly measured free 
25(OH)D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and albumin. Calculated free 25(OH)D was 
estimated. 
Results: The UV-B radiation during the sampling month was positively correlated with 
the serum levels of total 25(OH)D (r = 0.355, P &lt; 0.001), directly measured free (r = 0.336, 
P &lt; 0.001) and calculated free 25(OH)D (r = 0.275, P &lt; 0.001), but not with DBP and 
albumin. The percentage of free 25(OH)D was higher during the winter months than 
that during the summer months (0.020 ± 0.005% vs 0.019 ± 0.004%; P = 0.007) and higher 
in participants with a serum 25(OH)D below 25 nmol/L than that in participants with a 
serum 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L (0.031 ± 0.007% vs 0.017 ± 0.003%; P &lt; 0.001). iPTH was 
correlated with directly measured free 25(OH)D (r = −0.226; P &lt; 0.001), but only weakly 
with calculated free 25(OH)D (r = −0.095; P = 0.027). 
Conclusions: Directly measured free serum 25(OH)D was highly correlated with 
total serum 25(OH)D and followed the same seasonal variation, whereas the serum 
concentrations of DBP and albumin were stable. The fluctuation in free 25(OH)D was 
only marginally damped with an increase in the percentage of free 25(OH)D during the 
winter months and in participants with vitamin D deficiency. </p>

<p>Vitamin D is essential for the calcium homeostasis and 
bone health and also of importance for the immune 
function, muscles and the cardiovascular system. Vitamin 
D3 is mainly produced in the skin after ultraviolet 
radiation, but smaller amounts of vitamin D2 and D3 are </p>

<p>also obtained via food. To be activated, the prohormones 
undergo hydroxylation in two steps; firstly in the liver 
to become the pro-hormone 25-hydroxy vitamin D 
[25(OH)D] and secondly in the kidneys to become the 
active hormone 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, [1,25(OH) 2 D]. </p>

The seasonal variation in free

<p>To assess a persons' vitamin D status, 25(OH)D is the 
metabolite that is measured in serum (1). Being a highly 
hydrophobic molecule, most circulating 25(OH)D is 
bound to either vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) (88%) 
or albumin (12%) and only a small fraction, less than 1%, 
circulates in a free unbound form (2). 25(OH)D binds with 
high affinity to DBP, but with lower affinity to albumin. 
The albumin-bound fraction of 25(OH)D plus free fraction 
has therefore been referred to as the bioavailable fraction 
of 25(OH)D (3, 4). 
DBP is a 52-58 kDa glucoprotein produced in the 
liver, belonging to the albuminoid superfamily (5). 
First of all DBP is a carrier protein for the circulating 
vitamin D metabolites, but other roles for the protein 
have been described, such as the binding of fatty acids 
and endotoxins, chemotactic effects on neutrophil 
granulocytes, activating of macrophages and the 
sequestration of actin upon tissue damage (6). As the serum 
concentration of DBP is 20-fold higher than that of the 
vitamin D metabolites, only 2-5% of the circulating DBP 
is occupied by the vitamin D metabolites [25(OH)D and 
1,25(OH) 2 D]. DBP prolongs the half-life of 25(OH)D, can 
act as a reservoir for 25(OH)D in situations of deficiency 
and also protect against vitamin D intoxication (7). 
The concentration of free 25(OH)D can either 
be calculated using a formula, which includes the 
concentrations of DBP and albumin as described herein, 
or it can be directly measured (8). A problem with the 
calculation of the free concentration is that the DBP 
levels are not constant, but can vary in conditions such as 
pregnancy, liver cirrhosis, kidney disease and malnutrition 
(9). The concentrations of DBP and its' binding affinity 
for the vitamin D metabolites also vary among different 
populations depending on the polymorphism in the 
expression of the three different DBP isotypes (6, 10). 
Lower DBP concentrations have been observed in 
African-Americans compared with European-Americans 
when DBP was measured with an immunoassay using 
monoclonal DBP antibodies, but not when measured with 
a mass spectrometry or immunoassays using polyclonal 
DBP antibodies (11, 12, 13, 14, 15). 
In a previous study, we analyzed serum 25(OH)D in a 
cohort of blood donors during 12 months and found that 
50% of the participants had a 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/L 
during 50% of the year and that the levels varied greatly 
with season (16). 
The primary aim of the present study was to determine 
if the seasonal variations observed in total 25(OH)D in 
serum is followed by a concomitant variation in free 
25(OH)D or if the variation is damped by alterations in </p>

<p>the binding capacity of DBP. We also wanted to compare 
the concentrations of directly measured with calculated 
free 25(OH)D and explore the associations between serum 
DBP and free 25(OH)D with demographic and life style-
associated parameters. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Healthy blood donors </p>

<p>Healthy blood donors resident in Gothenburg, Sweden 
(57°41′N, 11°59′E) were invited to participate in the 
study when giving blood. Totally 540 blood donors were 
included, 40-60 in the middle of each month during 
a whole year. All blood samples were collected in the 
morning between 08:00 and 11:00 h. 
Informed consent was obtained from all individual 
participants included in the study. The study was approved 
by the Regional Ethics Committee in Gothenburg and 
carried out in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. 
All blood donors stated that they were in full 
physical health and answered questionnaires regarding 
medication, smoking habits, physical activity, sunbed 
use and sun holidays during the previous month. A sun 
holiday was defined as a journey to a location south of the 
latitude 43°N. Body weight and height were measured, 
and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. </p>

<p>Ethical approval </p>

<p>All procedures performed in the study involving human 
participants were in accordance with the ethical standards 
of the institutional and/or national research committee 
and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later 
amendments or comparable ethical standards. </p>

<p>Laboratory analyses </p>

<p>The serum samples were frozen at −80°C immediately 
after collection. 
Serum 25(OH)D (both D2 and D3) was analyzed with 
chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) on a LIAISON 
instrument (DiaSorin Inc, Stillwater, MN, USA). The total 
coefficient of variance (CV) for serum 25(OH)D was 5-6%, 
with the highest variance in the lowest test range, and the 
limit of quantification (LoQ) was 12.5 nmol/L at a CV of 8%. 
The free 25(OH)D concentration in serum was 
measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) using a commercial kit (Future Diagnostics 
Solutions, Wijchen, The Netherlands), hereafter, named </p>

<p>directly measured free 25(OH)D. The analysis at the 
laboratory showed a total CV of 7.6% at a level of 4 pg/mL 
and a CV of 18% at 1.8 pg/mL, which was used as LoQ. 
Only two patients had a serum-free 25(OH)D below LoQ. 
The concentration of free 25(OH)D in serum was measured 
in pg/mL, but converted to pmol/L by using the formula 
1 pg/mL = 2.5 pmol/L. 
Serum DBP was measured with a monoclonal ELISA 
(R&amp;D Systems). Our analysis showed a total CV of 7.4% 
at the level of 268 mg/L and a CV of 17.6% at 1.3 mg/L, 
which was to be used as LoQ. 
Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was 
analyzed with CLIA on an Abbott ARCHITECT instrument 
(Abbott Diagnostics Division) and serum 1,25(OH) 2 D was 
analyzed on an IDS-iSYS instrument (Immunodiagnostic 
Systems Holdings, Boldon, UK). The serum levels of 
albumin, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), 
calcium, phosphate, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), sexual hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol 
and testosterone were analyzed with standard laboratory 
techniques on a Cobas instrument (Roche Molecular 
Diagnostics). </p>

comparisons between groups, the independent samples 
t-test was used for continuous variables and the chi-square 
test for categorical variables. Correlations were calculated 
using Pearson correlation (r) for all parameters, except 
for hsCRP where Spearman correlation (r S ) was used 
due the skewed distribution of the parameter. All tests 
were two-tailed, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Linear regression with a stepwise method was 
run with serum DBP as outcome. Covariates were the 
parameters significantly associated with serum DBP in the 
first analyses. The results from the linear regression are 
presented as unstandardized coefficients (В) and standard 
error (s.e.). </p>

<p>The seasonal variation in vitamin D metabolites </p>

<p>The serum levels of free 25(OH)D, both directly measured 
and calculated and bioavailable 25(OH)D all followed the 
seasonal variation of total serum 25(OH)D, with a peak 
during the summer months and a low point during the 
winter months. There was no seasonal variation in serum 
DBP, serum albumin, serum calcium or serum 1,25(OH) 2 D. 
Serum phosphate also followed the seasonal variation of 
total 25(OH)D, whereas serum iPTH demonstrated an 
inverse pattern with a low point during the summer and 
a peak during the winter (Fig. 1). 
The CIE-weighted UV radiation during the sampling 
month was positively correlated with the serum levels of 
total 25(OH)D (r = 0.355, P &lt; 0.001), directly measured free 
25(OH)D (r = 0.336, P &lt; 0.001), calculated free 25(OH)D 
(r = 0.275, P &lt; 0.001) and bioavailable 25(OH)D (r = 0.275, 
P &lt; 0.001), but not with the serum levels of DBP (r = −0.011, </p>

<p>unbound form, was calculated using the formula: 
(directly measured serum free 25(OH)D/serum total 
25(OH)D). The percentage of free 25(OH)D was 
0.019 ± 0.004% in this cohort. 
The percentage of free 25(OH)D was negatively 
correlated with total serum 25(OH)D; r = −0.474, P &lt; 0.001 
(Fig. 3A). Thus, the percentage of free 25(OH)D was </p>

<p>higher during the winter months than that during the 
summer months (0.020 ± 0.005% vs 0.019 ± 0.004%; 
P = 0.007) and higher in participants with a serum 
25(OH)D below 25 nmol/L than that in participants 
with a serum 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L (0.031 ± 0.007% 
vs 0.017 ± 0.003%; P &lt; 0.001) (Table 3). </p>

<p>The percentage of free 25(OH)D was also positively 
associated with BMI (r = 0.206, P &lt; 0.001). 
When using calculated free 25(OH)D in the formula 
for the percentage of free 25(OH)D (calculated serum 
free 25(OH)D/serum total 25(OH)D) the free percentage 
was significantly larger (0.032 ± 0.013%; P ≤ 0.001), as 
expected. The correlation with total serum 25(OH)D 
was also weaker (r = −0.134, P = 0.002) and the value of 
the percentage of free 25(OH)D of calculated free 
25(OH)D increased less in vitamin D deficiency (Fig. 3B 
and Table 3). </p>

<p>Directly measured free 25(OH)D in serum in relation

<p>Directly measured free 25(OH)D was equally distributed 
over sex, age and smoking status, but negatively correlated 
with BMI (r = −0.175, P &lt; 0.001). The higher levels of total 
25(OH)D in serum among the women could be due to 
their higher use of sun beds, as explained previously (16). 
In addition, directly measured free 25(OH)D was 
higher in sun bed users compared with that in non-
users (13.7 ± 4.8 vs 11.4 ± 4.3 pmol/L; P = 0.014) and in 
participants who had been on a sun holiday during the 
last month (15.9 ± 5.9 vs 11.2 ± 4.0; P &lt; 0.001). </p>

<p>Serum DBP in relation to demographics, vitamin D 
metabolites and other laboratory parameters </p>

<p>The associations between DBP and demographic variables, 
vitamin D metabolites and other laboratory parameters 
are shown in Table 4. </p>

<p>Serum DBP was higher in women than that in men. 
The 95% confidence interval (CI) was 102−517 mg/L for 
the women and 92−382 mg/L for the men. Premenopausal 
women had a tendency to have higher serum DBP than 
postmenopausal women, but the difference did not 
reach the level of significance. Among women under age 
50 years, the users of oral contraceptives had significantly 
higher serum DBP than non-users. The users of oral 
contraceptives also had significantly higher serum total 
25(OH)D (87.5 ± 39.3 vs 64.9 ± 22.7; P = 0.017), but 
lower free percentage of 25(OH)D (0.017 ± 0.003% vs 
0.019 ± 0.004%; P = 0.015) compared with non-users, 
whereas the difference in directly measured free 
25(OH)D in serum did not reach level of significance 
(14.3 ± 6.1 vs 11.8 ± 4.1; P = 0.076), maybe due to the 
relatively small number of cases. 
Further serum DBP was positively correlated with 
SHBG and hsCRP and weakly negatively correlated 
with BMI. 
Serum DBP was also positively correlated with serum 
levels of total 25(OH)D and negatively correlated with 
calculated free 25(OH)D) and iPTH, whereas no correlation 
with directly measured free 25(OH)D was found. 
Linear regression was run with serum DBP as outcome 
and the following parameters as covariates: sex, age, BMI, 
use of contraceptives and the serum levels of 25(OH)D, 
1,25(OH) 2 D, iPTH, SHBG, testosterone and estradiol. In 
this analysis, serum DBP remained independently and 
significantly associated with serum SHBG (B = 0.472, </p>

<p>s.e. = 13.792, P &lt; 0.001), total serum 25(OH)D (B = 0.395,

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>We measured free 25(OH)D and DBP in serum in 540 
healthy blood donors during 12 months to determine 
if the variation in total serum 25(OH)D with season is 
followed by a concomitant variation in free 25(OH)D. 
We found that directly measured free serum 25(OH)D 
was highly correlated with total serum 25(OH)D and 
followed the same seasonal variation, whereas the serum 
concentrations of DBP and albumin were stable. The 
fluctuation in free 25(OH)D was only marginally damped 
with an increase in the percentage of free 25(OH)D in 
participants with vitamin D deficiency and during the 
winter months, reflecting DBP ability to act as a reservoir 
for 25(OH)D. Our findings of stable concentrations of 
serum DBP during the year are supported by one earlier 
study from 1981 (17). 
The free hormone hypothesis states that protein-
bound hormones are inactive and that only the free 
unbound fraction of a hormone can enter the cells 
and exert its biological effects (18, 19). In the case of 
vitamin D, the pro-hormone 25(OH)D must enter the 
cells to be α-hydroxylated to 1,25(OH) 2 D. In the kidney, 
the intracellular uptake of 25(OH)D mainly occurs by 
megalin-mediated endocytosis of 25(OH)D bound to DBP </p>

<p>and the uptake of 25(OH)D is thus facilitated by DBP 
(20). Megalin expression has also been found in other 
tissues such as the mammary glands, parathyroid gland, 
epididymis, lung and the placenta (21). Most other tissues 
are however dependent on the direct diffusion of the free 
unbound vitamin D forms through the cell wall and data 
suggest that DBP may actually have an inhibitory effect 
on 25(OH)D uptake here (7, 22). The seasonal variation 
in the concentration of free 25(OH)D shown in this study 
may thus have importance especially for extra-renal 
tissues, such as the immune cells. 
When comparing directly measured free 25(OH)D 
with calculated free 25(OH)D, we found that the directly 
measured concentration was significantly lower than the 
calculated, a finding supported by earlier studies (15). 
Directly measured free 25(OH)D also showed a stronger 
correlation with serum iPTH, indicating that directly 
measured free 25(OH)D more adequately reflects the 
biologic activity of vitamin D compared with the calculated 
free 25(OH)D. The same findings and conclusion were 
reported by Schwartz and coworkers in an earlier study 
(10). In addition, we found that directly measured 
25(OH)D better reflected DBP's ability to moderate the 
variation in free 25(OH)D by increasing the percentage 
of free 25(OH)D in situations of vitamin D deficiency </p>

<p>and decreasing it in times of abundance. Based on these 
results, we consider the use of directly measured free 
25(OH)D to be of greater value than the calculated free 
25(OH)D. The discrepancies found between calculated 
and directly measured free 25(OH)D may be explained by 
that the affinity of 25(OH)D for DBP and albumin is not 
constant but varies depending on access to 25(OH)D and 
between individuals. 
In the present study, the participants were Caucasians, 
ethnically homogenous and without any conditions 
known to affect the levels of DBP. Thus, the variation in 
the serum concentration of DBP was small. 
Directly measured free 25(OH)D was strongly 
correlated with total 25(OH)D, and the negative 
association with serum iPTH was comparable between 
the directly measured and total 25(OH)D. Similar to our 
previous report on total 25(OH)D, directly measured 
25(OH)D was positively associated with parameters 
reflecting the UV-B exposure, such as the UV-B irradiance 
during the sampling month, sun holidays and sun bed 
use (16). Based on this, we found no strong advantages 
in measuring free 25(OH)D instead of total 25(OH)D to 
evaluate the vitamin D status clinically. 
The current study confirms the results of earlier 
studies with higher serum concentrations of DBP 
in women and in users of oral contraceptives and 
hormone replacement therapy, but we found no 
association between DBP and the levels of sex hormones 
in serum (23). Instead, we found that serum DBP was 
independently and positively associated with serum 
SHBG after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, estrogen use and 
levels of sex hormones. Both DBP and SHBG are proteins 
known to be induced by estrogens (24). Our findings, 
however, suggest a common regulatory pathway for DBP 
and SHBG, beyond the sex hormones. 
Several earlier studies have reported a negative 
association between total serum 25(OH)D and BMI (25). 
We found that increasing BMI was associated with lower 
levels of total 25(OH)D, free 25(OH)D and DBP, but on 
the other hand, with an increased percentage of free 
25(OH)D. The majority of the individuals in this cohort 
were however of normal weight (60.7%) and only a 
minority were obese (6.3%). 
The present study has some limitations. Blood donors 
are a selected population of healthy individuals, and the 
results of the study may therefore not be representative 
of the general Swedish population. Gothenburg is situated 
at northern latitude, where the UV-B irradiance is too 
low during the winter months to allow the photolysis of </p>

<p>vitamin D. As a result, the study may not be representative 
for populations living at southern latitudes. The measuring 
of free hormone concentrations has difficulties. The 
percentage of total 25(OH)D, which exists in free form 
is very low, and the assay needs to be highly sensitive 
and specific to avoid cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the 
relationship between the free fraction and the protein-
bound fraction may not be the same in in vitro as 
in vivo. The method used to measure free 25(OH)D in the 
current study needs further evaluation. Total 25(OH)D 
was measured with CLIA and not with the gold standard 
method liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS). Serum DBP was assessed with ELISA using a 
monoclonal antibody specific for DBP. Recent studies have 
found that this method has problems detecting the DBP 
variant GC1f, which is common in populations of African 
descent. In the present study, no assessment of DBP 
genotype was done. The study population was however 
of European ancestry, where the GC1f genotype is rare, so 
the use of a monoclonal ELISA should not have had any 
great impact on our results. Another study limitation was 
that serum estrogen in the premenopausal women was not 
measured on a standardized day of the menstrual cycle. </p>

<p>Conclusions </p>

<p>Directly measured free 25(OH)D in serum was strongly 
correlated with total 25(OH)D and followed the same 
seasonal variation, whereas the serum concentrations 
of DBP and albumin were stable during the year. 
The variation in directly measured free 25(OH)D was 
however damped with an increase in the percentage 
of free 25(OH)D in situations of vitamin D deficiency 
and a decrease in vitamin D abundance. Both directly 
measured and total 25(OH)D were negatively correlated 
with serum iPTH, but calculated free 25(OH)D was only 
weakly associated with iPTH. Serum DBP was higher in 
women and estrogen users and independently associated 
with SHBG. </p>
