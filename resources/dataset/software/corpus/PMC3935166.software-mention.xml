internet-enabled device (smartphones, tablet-PCs or laptops). A paper-
based survey was conducted with undergraduate medical students and 
lecturers at TUM to compare "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" with conventional AR systems 
using clickers. "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" received above-average evaluation results 
by both students and lecturers at TUM and was seen on par or superior 
to conventional AR systems. The survey results indicated that up to 80% 
of students at TUM own an internet-enabled device (smartphone or

Summary and Conclusion: "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" is a novel web-based and plat-
form-independent AR system for higher education that was well received 
by students and lecturers. As a non-commercial alternative to conven-
tional AR systems it may foster interactive teaching in undergraduate 
education, in particular with large audiences. </p>

<p>Keywords: audience response system, interactive teaching </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>There is an increasing shift in higher education from 
teacher-centered to more interactive, student-centered 
teaching concepts. This is in part due to the known limit-
ations of traditional lectures, such as low student atten-
tion or inefficient knowledge acquisition and translation 
[1]. To foster interactive learning and student engage-
ment, in particular with large student numbers, audience 
response (AR) systems are increasingly used at educa-
tional institutions worldwide [2]. AR systems typically 
consist of an hardware transmitter ("clicker") that is 
controlled by the student, a radio-frequency receiver and 
a computer with software to display voting results during 
the presentation by the instructor, e.g. as histogram of 
responses [3]. AR systems are used in a variety of ways: 
to increase student interaction and attention, to promote 
in-class discussions, to evaluate student knowledge or 
as formative assessments for the lecturer to adjust 
teaching pace and didactics [2]. Recent meta-analyses 
in health profession education showed that AR systems 
are favored by the vast majority of students and likely </p>

<p>result in improved short-term and long-term knowledge 
outcomes [4]. However, many instructors only reluctantly 
use AR systems in teaching. Frequently cited reasons are 
high acquisition and maintenance costs, logistic efforts 
or technical difficulties to operate AR system with different 
operating systems and presenter software [5]. 
To overcome these limitations we sought to develop a 
novel web-based AR system that is specifically adapted 
to the didactic needs and economic requirements of 
higher education. Here we present "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>", a novel 
smartphone-and web-based AR system that is free-to-
use, platform independent and does not require hardware 
clicker or additional software. Based on user evaluation 
data, we analyzed the strengths and limitations of "On-
lineTED" in comparison with a conventional AR system 
that is used at TUM and discuss the potential of web-
based AR systems for undergraduate medical education. </p>

<p>OPEN ACCESS </p>

<p>medicine </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Programming and online database </p>

<p>"OnlineTED" was developed and programmed by students 
and lecturers at TUM. <rs type="software">Hypertext Preprocessor</rs> (PHP) as 
server-side programming language was used to build a 
web-based AR system that is compatible with different 
operating systems. The user interface was linked to a <rs type="software">My 
Structured Query Language</rs> (MySQL) database for storage 
and management of user accounts and data. <rs type="software">JavaScript</rs> 
was used as client-side programming language for anim-
ated features, e.g. a poll countdown function. Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) was implemented to 
ensure secure internet communication for the user. </p>

<p>Structure and features </p>

<p>The AR system "<rs id="software-25" type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" can be accessed via the open-
access website <rs corresp="#software-25" type="url">http://www.OnlineTED.com</rs> (German 
version: http://www.OnlineTED.de). After log-on, the main 
page conveys information for the auditorium to participate 
in a poll (e.g. website URL for login, session token, quick 
response (QR) code). For the lecturer, the main page is 
the starting point to create, manage or commence polls. 
Flags link to the sub-pages "poll viewer" to start of a 
polling session, "quick poll" for spontaneous polls and 
"poll editor" to create or manage question sets (see Figure 
1). In the latter, new poll sets and questions in multiple-
choice format can be created and saved via an online 
form (see Figure 2). In addition, image (gif, jpg or png), 
movie (mov, avi or mpeg) or sound files (mp3, aac or wav) 
can be uploaded and saved with each question. Other 
media sources of the internet (e.g. http:// 
www.youtube.com/) can be directly embedded. In addition 
to prepared and saved questions sets, the lecturer can 
conduct spontaneous polls by choosing different rating 
scales (yes / no / undecided; very low -very high; excel-
lent -insufficient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) from 
the "quick poll" options. 
Students can participate in the poll after log-on to the 
website with any internet-enabled device (smartphone, 
tablet-PC, laptop). A poll is joined by entering a four-digit 
access code (session token) that is automatically gener-
ated and displayed for each session. Alternatively, stu-
dents can scan a QR code with their mobile device. Upon 
session log-on, answer options are automatically dis-
played on the student devices (see Figure 3A ). After vot-
ing, the results are dynamically displayed in the present-
ation by the lecturer as growing histograms depicting the 
number and percentage of votes for each answer (see 
Figure 3B ). 
Each poll question requires a bidirectional data transfer 
of approximately 0.03 Mbit. Based on the average con-
nections speed of wireless Local Area Network (LAN) (54 
MBits/s) or cellular mobile networks such as Universal 
Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) (7.2 Mbit/s) 
[6], "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" enables polls with large audiences in a 
typical lecture hall setting. </p>

<p>The AR system was programmed in <rs type="software">PHP</rs> as a server-sided 
programming language to be compatible with all operating 
systems without the requirement to install additional 
software. </p>

<p>Study design and user evaluation </p>

<p>To evaluate the use of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" in higher education, 
the tool was tested with undergraduate medical students 
and instructors in lectures (average number of parti-
cipants: 200±50) and seminars (average number of 
participants: 22±3) of pharmacology at TUM in the winter 
term of 2012/13. A conventional AR system using hard-
ware clickers (Interwrite Cricket , Scotsdale, USA) that is 
routinely used for teaching at TUM served as a comparis-
on. 
Information on usability and user perception of the two 
different AR systems was solicited through a paper survey 
at the end of the term. A 1-to-6 rating scale was used to 
assess the overall rating of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>". The answer op-
tions were 1 "excellent", 2 "very good", 3 "good", 4 "fair", 
5 "poor" and 6 "inadequat". For the comparison of "Online-
TED" and the conventional AR systems, survey parti-
cipants were asked to select the option "superior", "equal" 
or "inferior" for each of the categories, respectively. 
Study participation was voluntary and both informed 
consent by the participants and approval by the ethics 
committee of TUM were obtained. Website statistics were 
tracked by <rs type="software">Google Analytics</rs> (Google, Mountain View, CA). </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Comparison "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" vs. conventional AR 
system </p>

<p>A conventional AR system using hardware clickers (Inter-
write Cricket , Scotsdale, USA) that is routinely used for 
teaching at TUM served as a comparison. Interwrite 
Cricket consists of 2.4 Ghz band radio receiver and radio 
transmitters (clicker). The system can manage up to 2047 
clickers per receiver. The keypad of the clicker consists 
of six numeric and additional true and false buttons. The 
clickers are powered by two AAA batteries each that last 
approximately 20 weeks based on typical usage. The 
operative range of the clickers is up to 150 feet (45.7 m) 
from the receivers (in free space). <rs id="software-15" type="software">Interwrite Cricket</rs> soft-
ware runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and supports the 
generation of multiple-choice and true/false questions 
with a authoring software that requires installation on 
the computer of the presenter (<rs corresp="#software-15" type="url">http://www.banxia.com/prs/hardware/cricket</rs>). 
In contrast, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" is a web-based AR system that 
utilizes internet-enabled end devices of the audience as 
handsets. "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" does not require the installation 
of software, is fully web-based and thus can be used on 
any operating system. Each poll question requires a bi-
directional data transfer of approximately 0.03 Mbit, 
which enables the participation of large audiences even </p>

and spontaneous polls with different rating scales (yes /

<p>Survey participation </p>

<p>To evaluate "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" and compare its user acceptance 
with conventional AR systems, a paper-based survey was 
conducted with students and lecturers at TUM. 361 of 
709 (51%) students participated in the survey. Of these, 
203 students were in their first clinical year (third year of 
study) at TUM and enrolled in the course "basic pharma-
cology" consisting of lectures and seminars. 158 students 
were in the third clinical year (sixth year of study) at TUM 
and enrolled in the course "clinical pharmacology" that </p>

dents enrolled was 23.4 (SD 3.5) years in the course 
"basic pharmacology" and 25.3 (SD 3.3) years in the 
course "clinical pharmacology". Of the lecturers, nine of 
ten participated in the survey. Their average age was 40.1 
(SD 10.0) years. </p>

<p>Web statistics and evaluation data </p>

<p>The <rs corresp="#software-36" type="version-number">beta-version</rs> of "<rs id="software-36" type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" was made available on 
<rs corresp="#software-36" type="version-date">November1st,2012</rs> at <rs corresp="#software-36" type="url">http://www.OnlineTED.com</rs> (Ger-
man version: http://www.OnlineTED.de). As of February 
28th, 2013, the website has been accessed by 2,997 
visitors with 37,696 page hits (approximately 750 visitors 
and 9,424 page hits per month). 
The overall rating of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" by lecturers was "very 
good" (5 out of 10) or "excellent" (4 out of 10). The didact-
ic benefit of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" for teaching was considered 
"excellent" by 6 out of 10 and "very good" by 3 out of 10 
lecturers. Free text comments by the lecturers indicated 
that "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" provided a "helpful basis for in-class 
discussions between students and lecturer". In addition, 
"playful discussion of topics and clinical problems", e.g. 
by presenting clinical cases and questions on pharmaco-
therapy, drug choice and clinical management were 
considered a key didactic benefit of AR systems. A specific 
advantage of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" was seen in the possibility to 
"spontaneously assess the learning and knowledge state" 
of the students by using the instant poll option. 
When asked to compare "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" with conventional 
AR systems using hardware clickers, the lecturers rated 
"OnlineTED" superior in seven out of nine categories (see 
Figure 4A ). The areas with the highest advantage for 
lecturers were seen in time required to use the TED sys-</p>

<p>tem for the first time, well as its flexibility (10 out of 10 
and 9 out of 10, respectively). 
Approximately 80% (289 of 361) of the undergraduate 
medical students in the studied cohort at TUM indicated 
to own a mobile internet-enabled device (smartphone, 
tablet-PC or iPad). Of these, the majority (92%, n=265) 
could access the polling session without difficulty using 
either wireless LAN or cellular data network during lec-
tures or seminars. The vast majority of students (94%, 
n= 274) gave an overall rating for "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" of "excel-
lent" or "very good". "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" was seen on par or su-
perior in all categories when compared to conventional 
AR systems using hardware clickers (see Figure 4B ). </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>In this article we present "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>", a novel web-based 
audience response system that is free-to-use, platform-
independent and does not require hardware clickers. Our 
aim was to develop an AR system for higher education 
that is on par with commercial systems with respect to 
functionality and usability. Surprisingly, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" was 
evaluated superior in a number of categories by both 
students and lecturers (see Figure 4). In particular, its 
usability and flexibility with regard to handling, question 
management and in-class performance were seen as key 
advantages of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" in comparison to conventional 
AR systems. Finally, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" is a non-commerical AR 
system that is freely available to educators and students 
worldwide. 
A potential limitation of "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" is its dependency on 
internet availability that may be limited or restricted at 
some university campuses due to poor WLAN coverage </p>

<p>or cellular network reception. Another important issue is 
the safety of data on the internet. To address these con-
cerns, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" has implemented HTTPS, a commu-
nications protocol for secure communication over a 
computer network that is used for sensitive data transfer 
e.g. electronic banking. HTTPS provides bi-directional 
encryption of data transfer between a client and server 
and authentication of the web site and associated web 
server [7]. As an additional safety measure, "<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" 
does not permit users to identify the IP address of devices 
used in a poll, thus assuring the anonymity of poll parti-
cipants. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to in-
vestigate the concerns and attitudes of students and 
lecturers to web-based technology and its impact for 
higher education. 
Extensive research on AR systems in higher education 
has indicated their effectiveness on different learning 
outcomes, such as knowledge gain, student self-confid-
ence and positive learner reactions (reviewed by [5], [8], 
[9]). The most commonly cited benefit of AR systems are 
the increased student engagement through active parti-
cipation. However, while AR systems provide a convenient 
way to improve student interactivity, it is in the end ped-
agogy and didactic implementation that matters. In a re-
cent study by Smith et al. [10], students were encouraged 
to discuss TED clicker questions with their classmates 
prior to voting. The authors demonstrated that peer dis-</p>

<p>cussions are effective means of active learning that res-
ulted in significantly improved conceptual understanding 
when used with AR systems. In this regard, the frequently 
cited limitation of AR systems that not all students may 
be able to participate in a poll due to limited numbers of 
clickers or internet-enabled devices may offer the oppor-
tunity for collaborative voting and peer discussions in 
class. Another pedagogical aspect of AR systems, which 
is often overlooked, is its use in formative assessment 
and feedback. A recent report by Alexander et al. showed 
that AR systems can be successfully used to monitor the 
progress of students in the curriculum and allow students 
to compare their learning progress with other classmates 
[11] . 
The omnipresence of the internet and availability of 
computer-based technologies open up new opportunities 
to actively engage students in teaching. Our survey re-
vealed that up to 80% of undergraduate medical students 
at TUM posses an internet-enabled device (smartphone, 
tablet or iPad). This results is in accordance with recent 
studies that 60 to 80% of UK medical students own a 
smartphone [12], [13]. Web-based AR systems such as 
"<rs type="software">OnlineTED</rs>" may thus provide a feasible alternative to 
conventional, hardware-based AR technology in teaching 
and become a suitable tool to foster interactive learning 
and student engagement in undergraduate medical 
education, in particular with large audiences. </p>

"OnlineTED" ermöglicht es Dozenten, Fragensammlungen online zu 
erstellen, verwalten und in der Lehrveranstaltung mit einem Webbrowser 
anzuzeigen. Studierende können mit jedem internetfähigen Endgerät 
(Smartphone, Tablet-PC oder Laptop) an der Abstimmung teilnehmen. 
Eine Datenerhebung mit Hilfe eines Fragebogens, der Studierenden 
und Dozenten der TUM ausgehändigt wurde, enthielt Fragen zum Besitz 
von internetfähigen Endgeräten, der Akzeptanzmessung von "OnlineTED" 
sowie dem Vergleich von "OnlineTED" mit einem kommerziellen TED-
System mit Klickern. Die Nutzerevaluationen von Studierenden und 
Dozenten ergab eine überdurchschnittlich positive Beurteilung von 
"OnlineTED" im Vergleich zum kommerziellen TED-System mit Klickern. 
Die Mehrheit (80%) der befragten Studierenden gab an, ein internetfä-
higes Endgerät zu besitzen. 
Zusammenfassung und Schlussfolgerungen: "OnlineTED" ist ein neues, 
webbasiertes und plattformunabhängiges TED-Abstimmungssystem für 
Hochschulen, das von Studenten und Dozenten überdurchschnittlich 
positiv evaluiert wurde. Als nicht-kommerzielle Alternative zu herkömm-
lichen TED-Systemen unterstützt es die interaktive Ausbildung von 
Studierenden, insbesondere bei großen Teilnehmerzahlen. </p>

<p>Einleitung </p>

<p>Die Ausbildung an Hochschulen unterliegt einem zuneh-
menden Wandel von einer dozentenzentrierten zu einer 
verstärkt studentenfokussierten, interaktiven Lehre. Ur-
sachen für diese Entwicklung sind unter anderem bekann-
te Limitationen der klassischen Vorlesung, wie z. B. die 
hohe Passivität der Studierenden oder ein oft wenig effi-
zienter Wissenserwerb und -transfer [1]. Um die studen-
tische Mitarbeit und Interaktivität der Lehre zu verbes-
sern, insbesondere bei Lehrveranstaltungen mit hohen 
Teilnehmerzahlen, werden weltweit an Bildungseinrich-
tungen zunehmend elektronische Abstimmungssysteme 
(Synonym: Tele-Dialog, TED) im Unterricht eingesetzt [2]. </p>

<p>TED-Systeme bestehen typischerweise aus einem Funk-
sender ("Klicker"), der von den Studierenden bedient wird, 
einem Funkempfänger, sowie spezieller Software, um die 
Abstimmungsergebnisse in der Präsentation des Dozen-
ten* anzuzeigen, z.B. in Form von Histogrammen [3]. 
TED-Systeme werden in der Lehre auf vielfältige Weise 
eingesetzt: zur Förderung der studentischen Mitarbeit 
und Aufmerksamkeit während der Lehrveranstaltung, als 
Diskussionsgrundlage mit dem Auditorium, oder zur 
Überprüfung des Wissens-und Verständisstands der 
Studierenden. Ein weiterer Anwendungsbereich ist die 
formative Evaluation (formative assessment), durch die 
der Dozent mit Hilfe des TED-Systems eine sofortige 
Rückmeldung von den Studierenden erhält, um Lehrstil 
und -tempo bedarfsgerecht anzupassen [2]. </p>

<p>Humanmedizin </p>

<p>Aktuelle Metaanalysen der medizinischen Ausbildungsfor-
schung haben gezeigt, dass TED-Systeme von der Mehr-
heit der Studierenden gut angenommen werden und ihr 
Einsatz mit einem erhöhten kurz-und langfristigen Ler-
nerfolg verbunden sein kann [4]. 
Dennoch werden TED-Systeme von vielen Dozenten nicht 
oder nur zögerlich in der Lehre eingesetzt. Häufig genann-
te Gründe sind die hohen Anschaffungs-und Wartungs-
kosten konventioneller TED-Systeme, der logistische 
Aufwand für die Durchführung von Abstimmungen, sowie 
technische Schwierigkeiten wie zum Beispiel die Inkom-
patibilität der Software mit unterschiedlichen Betriebssys-
temen [5]. 
Unser Ziel war diesen Limitationen mit der Entwicklung 
eines neuen TED-Systems zu begegnen, das speziell an 
die didaktischen Anforderungen und wirtschaftlichen 
Möglichkeiten von Bildungseinrichtungen angepasst ist. 
In diesem Projektartikel stellen wir mit "OnlineTED" ein 
neues webbasiertes Abstimmungssystem vor, das keine 
zusätzliche Hard-oder Software erfordert, plattformunab-
hängig ist und kostenfrei genutzt werden kann. Auf der 
Grundlage von Evaluationsergebnissen diskutieren wir 
die Vor-und Nachteile von "OnlineTED" im Vergleich zu 
einem an der TUM eingesetzten konventionellen Abstim-
mungssystem und erörtern das Potenzial von webbasier-
ten TED-Systemen für die Hochschullehre. </p>

<p>Methoden </p>

<p>Programmierung und Onlinedatenbank </p>

<p>"OnlineTED" wurde von Studenten und Dozenten an der 
TUM entwickelt und programmiert. Hypertext Preprocessor 
(PHP) wurde als serverseitige Programmiersprache ver-
wendet, um ein Betriebssystem-unabhängiges TED-Sys-
tem zu konzipieren. Eine My Structured Query Language 
(MySQL)-Datenbank diente der Speicherung und Verwal-
tung von Benutzerdaten im Internet. JavaScript diente 
als clientseitige Programmiersprache für dynamische In-
halte, wie z. B. einer Countdown-Funktion während der 
Abstimmung. Ein Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure 
(HTTPS) wurde implementiert, um eine sichere Internet-
Kommunikation für die Nutzer zu gewährleisten. </p>

<p>Aufbau und Funktionsumfang </p>

<p>Das Abstimmungssystem "OnlineTED" kann über die In-
ternetseite 
http://www.OnlineTED.de 
(http:// 
www.OnlineTED.com, englischsprachige Version) aufge-
rufen werden. Nach dem Login werden auf der Startseite 
Informationen für die Teilnahme an einer Abstimmung 
angezeigt (z.B. den Uniform Resource Locator (URL) der 
Webseite mit einem aktuellen Zugangscode (Freischalt-
code), sowie ein Quick Response (QR) Code) (siehe Abbil-
dung 1). Für Dozenten ist die Startseite Ausgangspunkt 
für das Starten, Verwalten oder Verfassen von TED-Fra-
gen. Verschiedene Reiter ermöglichen den Zugriff auf die 
jeweiligen Bereiche: durch Anklicken des Reiters "Über-</p>

<p>sicht" kann eine bereits erstellte TED-Fragesammlung 
ausgewählt und gestartet werden. Der Reiter "Spontanum-
frage" verweist auf eine Sammlung von voreingestellten 
allgemeinen Kurzumfragen und -abstimmungen ("ja" / 
"nein" / "unentschlossen", "sehr gering" bis "sehr hoch", 
"ausgezeichnet" bis "unzureichend", "trifft zu" bis "trifft 
nicht zu") für den spontanen Einsatz in Lehrveranstaltun-
gen. Im Bereich "Fragenverwaltung" können bereits be-
stehende TED-Fragen modifiziert oder neue Fragensets 
im Multiple Choice (MC)-Format mit Hilfe einer Eingabe-
maske erstellt werden (siehe Abbildung 2). Das System 
ermöglicht die direkte Einbindung von Bild-(gif, jpg oder 
png), Film-(mov, avi oder mpeg) oder Audiodateien (mp3, 
aac oder wav) in TED-Fragen. Alternativ können Hyperlinks 
zu Lehrmedien (z.B. Filmclips in http://youtube.com) in 
TED-Fragen eingefügt werden. 
Studierende können sich mit jedem internetfähigen 
Endgerät (Smartphone, Tablet-PC oder Laptop) bei "Onli-
neTED" anmelden und an einer Abstimmung teilnehmen. 
Die Anmeldung erfolgt durch die manuelle Eingabe des 
vierstelligen Zugangscodes, der automatisch für jede 
TED-Sitzung generiert und angezeigt wird. Alternativ ist 
die Anmeldung durch Einscannen des QR-Codes möglich. 
Die Antwortoptionen der vom Dozenten gestarteten TED-
Frage werden automatisch auf den mobilen Endgeräten 
der Teilnehmer angezeigt (siehe Abbildung 3A ). Die Ant-
wortauswahl erfolgt durch Antippen oder Anklicken des 
jeweiligen Antwortfelds im Display. Die Abstimmungser-
gebnisse werden anschließend in der Präsentation des 
Dozenten als wachsende Histogramme mit Prozentangabe 
angezeigt (siehe Abbildung 3B ). 
Jede TED-Frage erfordert eine bidirektionale Datenüber-
tragung von ca. 0,03 Megabit (MBit). Auf Basis einer 
durchschnittlichen Datenübertragungsgeschwindigkeit 
von 54 MBit/s in Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) 
Funknetzen und 7,2 Mbit/s in Universal Mobile Telecom-
munications System (UMTS) Mobilfunknetzen [6], kann 
"OnlineTED" auch in Lehrveranstaltungen mit hohen 
Teilnehmerzahlen eingesetzt werden. 
Durch die Verwendung von PHP als serverseitige Program-
miersprache ist "OnlineTED" mit allen gängigen Betriebs-
systemen kompatibel. Eine Installation von zusätzlicher 
Software auf dem Computer des Dozenten oder den 
mobilen Endgeräten der Studierenden ist nicht erforder-
lich. </p>

<p>Evaluation und Studiendesign </p>

<p>Um die Funktionalität und Benutzerfreundlichkeit von 
"OnlineTED" in der Hochschullehre zu testen, wurde das 
Abstimmungssystem im Wintersemester 2012/13 in 
Vorlesungen (durchschnittliche Teilnehmerzahl: 200±50) 
und Seminaren (durchschnittliche Teilnehmerzahl: 22±3) 
der TUM eingesetzt. Ein konventionelles Abstimmungs-
system mit Hardware-Klickern (Interwrite Cricket, Scotts-
dale, USA), das an der TUM für die Lehre eingesetzt wird, 
diente als Vergleich. 
Die Datenerhebung erfolgte mit Hilfe eines Papierfrage-
bogens, der Studierenden und Dozenten der TUM in den </p>

<p>www.banxia.com/prs/hardware/cricket), das routinemä-
ßig im Unterricht an der TUM eingesetzt wird, diente als 
Vergleich. Das System besteht aus einem 2,4 Gigahertz 
Funkempfänger und Funksender (Klicker). Laut Angaben 
des Herstellers können bis zu 2047 Klicker mit einem 
Funkempfänger verbunden werden. Der Klicker besteht 
aus einer Tastatur mit sechs Schaltflächen für numerische 
Eingaben, sowie zwei Eingabeflächen "F" und "T" für 
Falsch/Richtig-Abstimmungen. Die Klicker enthalten zwei 
AAA-Batterien, die eine Nutzung von bis zu 20 Wochen 
bei normalen Einsatz ermöglichen. Die Reichweite des 
Systems beträgt maximal 45,7 m. Für die Erstellung von 
TED-Fragen (MC-und Richtig/Falsch-Fragen) sowie der 
Durchführung einer Abstimmung ist eine spezielle Soft-
ware erforderlich, die auf dem Rechner des Dozenten 
installiert wird. 
Im Gegensatz dazu ist "OnlineTED" ein vollständig webba-
siertes Abstimmungssystem, das die internetfähigen 
Endgeräte der Teilnehmer als Klicker nutzt. "OnlineTED" 
erfordert keine Installation von zusätzlicher Software auf 
den Endgeräten der Dozenten oder Studierenden und ist 
mit allen gängigen Betriebssystemen kompatibel. Durch 
den geringen Datentransfer (0,03 Mbit pro TED-Frage) 
sind auch Abstimmungen mit großen Teilnehmerzahlen 
und/oder geringer Bandbreite der Internetverbindung 
möglich. Da "OnlineTED" vollständig webbasiert ist, kön-
nen Abstimmungen auch mit Teilnehmern durchgeführt 
werden, die sich an unterschiedlichen Orten befinden 
(z.B. im Rahmen von Webinaren). In Gegensatz zu dem 
konventionellen Vergleichssystem erfolgt die Erstellung 
und Verwaltung der TED-Fragen bei "OnlineTED" aus-
schließlich online. Zusätzlich bietet "OnlineTED" die </p>

<p>Möglichkeit, Spontanumfragen durchzuführen. Hierfür 
stehen allgemeine Fragensets mit verschiedenen Rating-
Skalen ("ja" / "nein" / "unentschlossen", "sehr gering" bis 
"sehr hoch", "ausgezeichnet" bis "unzureichend", "trifft 
zu" bis "trifft nicht zu") zur Verfügung. 
An der Fragebogen-basierten Datenerhebung zur Bewer-
tung der Funktionalität und Benutzerfreundlichkeit von 
"OnlineTED" im Vergleich zu konventionellen Klicker-ba-
sierten TED-Systemen nahmen 361 von 709 (51 %) Stu-
denten der TUM teil. Von diesen besuchten 203 Studen-
ten die aus Vorlesungen und Seminaren bestehende 
Lehrveranstaltung "Allgemeine Pharmakologie" im ersten 
klinischen Studienjahr. 158 Studenten besuchten die 
Lehrveranstaltung "Klinische Pharmakologie" im dritten 
klinischen Studienjahr, die nur aus Vorlesungen besteht. 
Das Durchschnittsalter der Studenten war 23,4 (SD 3,5) 
Jahre in der Lehrveranstaltung "Allgemeine Pharmakolo-
gie" und 25,3 (SD 3,3) in der Lehrveranstaltung "Klinische 
Pharmakologie". Neun von zehn Dozenten beteiligten 
sich an der Umfrage, das Durchschnittsalter war 40,1 
(SD 10,0) Jahre. </p>

<p>Webstatistik und Evaluationsergebnisse </p>

<p>Die Beta-Version von "OnlineTED" wurde am 1. November 
2012 auf http://wwwOnlineTED.de (englischsprachige 
Version: http://wwwOnlineTED.com) bereitgestellt. In den 
ersten vier Monaten (bis 28. Februar 2013) verzeichnete 
die Webseite 2.997 Besucher und 37.696 Seitenzugriffe 
(ca. 750 Besucher und 9.424 Seitenzugriffe pro Monat).

<p>lent" (vier von zehn Dozenten). Der didaktische Nutzen 
von "OnlineTED" für den Unterricht wurde von sechs Do-
zenten mit "exzellent" und von drei Dozenten mit "sehr 
gut" bewertet. In den Freitextkommentaren wurde von 
den Dozenten angeführt, dass "OnlineTED" eine "hilfreiche 
Grundlage für Diskussionen zwischen Studenten und 
Dozenten während der Lehrveranstaltung" ist. Weiterhin 
wurde die Möglichkeit der "spielerischen Diskussion von 
Themen und klinischen Problemstellungen" als Vorteil 
gesehen, z.B. durch die Präsentation von klinischen 
Fallbeispielen mit Abstimmung der geeigneten Pharma-
kotherapie durch das Auditorium. Als spezifischer Vorteil 
von "OnlineTED" wurde angegeben, "spontan den Wissen-
stand und -fortschritt" der Studenten durch die Sponta-
numfragefunktion zu ermitteln. 
Im Vergleich zu konventionellen TED-Systemen mit 
Hardware-Klickern wurde "OnlineTED" von den Dozenten 
in insgesamt sieben von neun Kategorien als überlegen 
bewertet (siehe Abbildung 4A ). Als wichtigste Vorteile 
wurde von den Dozenten die kurze Einarbeitungszeit in 
das System, sowie die hohe Flexibilität von "OnlineTED" 
angesehen (zehn von zehn, und neun von zehn Dozen-
ten). 
Etwa 80% (289 von 361) der an der Umfrage beteiligten 
Studenten der TUM gaben an, ein mobiles internetfähiges 
Endgerät (Smartphone, Tablet-PC oder iPad) zu besitzen. 
Von diesen konnten die Mehrheit (92%, n=265) problem-
los über WLAN oder eine Mobilfunkverbindung an den 
TED-Abstimmung während der Lehrveranstaltung teilneh-
men. Die Mehrzahl der Studierenden (94%, n=274) ver-
gab für "OnlineTED" die Gesamtnote "exzellent" oder "sehr 
gut". Im Vergleich zu konventionellen Abstimmungssyste-
men mit Hardware-Clicker wurde "OnlineTED" von den 
Studierenden in allen Kategorien als gleichwertig oder 
überlegen eingestuft (siehe Abbildung 4B ). </p>

<p>Diskussion </p>

<p>In diesem Artikel stellen wir mit "OnlineTED" ein neues 
webbasiertes Abstimmungssystem vor, das plattformun-
abhängig ist, keine Hardware-Klicker benötigt und kosten-
frei genutzt werden kann. Ziel dieses Projekts war es, ein 
TED-System zu entwickeln, das speziell auf die Bedürfnis-
se und Anforderungen der Hochschullehre ausgerichtet 
ist und hinsichtlich Funktionalität und Benutzerfreundlich-
keit mit kommerziellen Systemen vergleichbar ist. Zu 
unserer Überraschung wurde "OnlineTED" sowohl von 
Studierenden als auch Dozenten in mehreren Kategorien 
als ein den kommerziellen Produkten überlegenes System 
bewertet (siehe Abbildung 4). Insbesondere die hohe 
Benutzerfreundlichkeit und Flexibilität von "OnlineTED" 
bei der Fragenerstellung und -verwaltung sowie der 
praktische Einsatz bei Lehrveranstaltungen wurden als 
Vorzüge im Vergleich zu konventionellen Abstimmungs-
systemen angeführt. Ferner kann "OnlineTED" als ein 
nicht-kommerzielles Abstimmungssystem von Dozenten 
und Studenten weltweit kostenfrei genutzt werden. </p>

<p>Eine potentielle Limitation für den Einsatz von webbasier-
ten TED-Systemen ist die Notwendigkeit einer Internetver-
bindung. Diese kann an einigen Universitäten aufgrund 
von Sicherheitsbestimmungen oder durch lokale bauliche 
Gegebenheiten mit schlechter WLAN-Abdeckung oder 
Mobilfunkempfang nicht oder nur eingeschränkt gegeben 
sein. Ein weiterer potentieller Unsicherheitsfaktor ist die 
Datensicherheit im Internet. Um einen sichere Datenüber-
tragung zu gewährleisten wurde bei "OnlineTED" das 
Kommunikationsprotokoll HTTPS implementiert, das z.B. 
beim Internetbanking für die Übertragung vertraulicher 
Daten Verwendung findet. HTTPS ermöglicht eine bidirek-
tionale verschlüsselte Datenübermittlung zwischen Client 
und Server mit Authentifizierung von Webseite und 
Webserver [7]. Als weitere Sicherheitsmaßnahme spei-
chert "OnlineTED" keine Internetprotokoll (IP) Adressen 
der Endgeräte, wodurch die Anonymität der Teilnehmer 
gewährleistet ist. 
In welchen Umfang bei Studierenden und Dozenten Be-
denken gegenüber webbasierten Lehrtechnologien beste-
hen, ist noch wenig untersucht. Hingegen deuten umfang-
reiche Studien über den Einsatz von TED-Systemen in 
der Hochschullehre auf deren Effektivität, z.B. in Hinblick 
auf Wissenserwerb, Meinungsbildung und Zufriedenheit 
der Studierenden im Unterricht (Übersicht in [5], [8], [9]). 
Der am häufigsten angeführte Vorteil von TED-Systemen 
ist die intensivierte studentische Mitarbeit und Interaktion 
in Lehrveranstaltungen. Hier stellen TED-Systeme eine 
bequeme Möglichkeit dar, studentische Mitarbeit zu för-
dern. Allerdings ist für den Lernerfolg letztlich die pädago-
gisch und didaktische Fähigkeit eines Dozenten entschei-
dend, und damit die Art der Einbindung von technischen 
Innovationen wie TED-Systemen in den Unterricht. Bei-
spielsweise wurden in einer Studie von Smith et al. [10] 
Studenten aufgefordert, TED-Fragen zunächst mit dem 
Platznachbarn zu diskutieren und erst nach gemeinsamer 
Konsensfindung abzustimmen. Die Autoren konnten zei-
gen, dass kollaboratives Diskutieren und Abstimmen mit 
TED-Systemen eine effektive Methode ist, aktives Lernen 
zu fördern und mit einem signifikant verbesserten kon-
zeptionellen Verständnis verbunden ist. Diese Ergebnisse 
relativieren Bedenken, dass durch eine limitierte Zahl 
von Abstimmungsgeräten nur ein Teil der Studenten aktiv 
am Unterricht teilnehmen können. Vielmehr könnte diese 
Situation auch die Möglichkeit zu dem vom Smith et al. 
[10] dargestellten didaktisch wertvolleren TED-Einsatz 
durch kooperatives Abstimmen eröffnen. Ein weiterer 
pädagogischer Aspekt von TED-Systemen ist deren Einsatz 
in der formativen Evaluation (formative assessment). 
Alexander und Kollegen [11] konnten zeigen, dass stu-
dentisches Feedback mit TED-Systemen erfolgreich für 
die bedarfsgerechte Anpassung der Lehre durch Dozenten 
genutzt werden kann. Für Studierende bietet sich die 
Möglichkeit, ihren persönlichen Lernfortschritt mit dem 
ihrer Kommilitonen zu vergleichen. 
Die Omnipräsenz des Internets und die weite Verbreitung 
computerbasierter Technologien eröffnen neue Möglich-
keiten, Studenten aktiv in der Lehre einzubeziehen. Un-
sere Datenerhebung ergab, dass bis zu 80% der Medizin-</p>
