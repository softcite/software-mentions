AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS </p>

<p>Greene (NYU) and John Siegfried (Vanderbilt) 
contributing on two modules. The modules deal 
with heteroskedasticity; endogenous regressors 
with natural experiments, instrumental vari-
ables, and two-stage estimators; panel data; and 
sample selection issues. Each module features 
"real-world" datasets and sample programs 
written in <rs type="software">Stata</rs>, <rs type="software">SAS</rs>, and <rs type="software">Limdep</rs>. Information 
on website "hits" is now available for the period 
corresponding to the 2011 "spring semester" at 
most US schools, from January-May 2011. The 
monthly average over this period was 220 hits/ 
views, with more hits in early and middle months 
of the "term." It appears (as supported by anec-
dotal accounts) that the modules and datasets 
are being used in many econometrics classes 
as general teaching tools, not just to introduce 
research topics in economic education. 
The Committee supports an NSF-funded proj-
ect on "Teaching with Data" in undergraduate 
social science courses, directed by George Alter 
and Bill Frey (both at Michigan). Tisha Emerson 
(Baylor) is the Committee representative for the </p>

<p>project's advisory board. A national survey of 
faculty across disciplines and Carnegie classifi-
cations of schools was completed and described 
in 2011 reports and found that instructors in eco-
nomics are much more demanding about quan-
titative skills than instructors from other social 
sciences, while faculty at Associate schools 
and non-tenure track faculty are less likely to 
teach quantitative reasoning. A presentation on 
this project was included in the Committee's 
annual poster session at the Chicago meetings 
in January 2012. 
The Committee supported an NSF-funded 
project on "Adapting Effective Outreach and 
Workshop Practices to Improve Community 
College Economics Instruction," directed by 
Mark Maier (Glendale Community College) 
and Cathryn Manduca (Carleton College). 
Participants in this program attended a work-
shop in Palo Alto for two days in May 2011, and 
many then attended the Committee's June 1-3 
conference on teaching economics at Stanford, 
described above. 
The Committee annually tracks the number 
of BA and BS degrees awarded at US colleges 
and universities. After three flat years, in 2008 
the number of degrees awarded resumed the 
sharp increases seen from 1997-2004 (when 
they rose 56 percent). Over the past three 
years, the number of undergraduate degrees </p>

<p>awarded rose by 16 percent. The percentage of 
undergraduate degrees in economics awarded 
to women declined slowly but steadily over 
the past six years, however, from a peak of 34 
percent in 2003 to 30 percent in recent years. 
This occurred while the share of all bachelor's 
degrees earned by women remained constant at 
about 58 percent. 
The Committee organized six sessions and 
two special events for the 2012 AEA meetings 
in Chicago. The six sessions were: </p>

<p>The Committee hosted two special events 
at the Chicago meetings: For the seventh 
consecutive year the Committee hosted a con-
tinental breakfast for department directors of 
undergraduate studies in economics, to discuss 
issues of concern and share information (orga-
nized by Tisha Emerson at Baylor and Gail Hoyt 
at Kentucky); the annual reception for Friends 
of Economic Education (invitation only) was 
also hosted. The Committee Chair also makes 
an annual presentation on resources and pro-
grams the Committee offers at the breakfast for 
Chairs of economics departments. 
Members of the Committee are called on to 
provide time and service each year, and they 
regularly and generously answer that call. 
Doug Bernheim completes his first term and 
begins a second. Other continuing members 
are Tisha Emerson, Ben Friedman, Gail Hoyt, 
Randy Kroszner, KimMarie McGoldrick, and 
Susan Rose. William Bosshardt will step down 
from the Committee in light of a new position 
he has taken with the Council for Economic 
Education in New York. New members joining 
the Committee in 2012 are Sam Allgood (Chair) 
and Steve Cobb. 
Bill Greene and Mike Watts complete their 
second terms on the Committee at the Chicago 
meetings, which invokes the AEA's term limit 
policy for committee memberships. Greene 
set a record that may well never be equaled in 
reviewing papers and abstracts submitted in 
response to Committee calls for papers for ses-
sions at the January AEA meetings, including 
the Committee's AER Papers and Proceedings 
session in 2009, which Greene organized. Watts 
served as Chair of the Committee for the past 
six years. 
Current information and past reports about 
the Committee and its activities are available

index.htm. </p>

<p>Respectfully submitted, 
Michael Watts, Chair </p>

<p> 
REPORT Of ThE COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC EDuCATION fOR 2011 </p>

<p>b. The JEE Editor and Taylor and Francis 
changed the cover, size, print style, and 
other internal features of the JEE start-
ing with Volume 41, Number 1 (January-
March 2010). No further changes were 
made in 2011 or are being considered. 
c. The JEE receives about 170 manu-
scripts a year (average over 2008-2011). 
Most manuscripts are published within 
a year of acceptance. Associate Editors 
have been very conscientious in seeking 
quality reviews and in making thought-
ful and timely recommendations to the 
Editor. 
d. Manuscripts are submitted to the 
JEE in a Word file by e-mail with a 
cover letter to jee@unl.edu. Taylor 
and Francis was willing to develop an 
electronic submission and manuscript 
management system for the JEE (aka: 
Manuscript Central), but for now the 
Associate Editors prefer to use the use 
the current e-mail system. 
e. Sharon Nemeth, the JEE Editorial 
Assistant at Nebraska, provides invalu-
able help with processing manuscripts, 
corresponding with authors and editors, 
and maintaining records. 
f. The JEE is published in cooperation with 
the Council for Economic Education, 
the Committee on Economic Education 
of the American Economic Association, 
and the Department of Economics at 
the University of Nebraska. The JEE is 
sponsored by the Council for Economic 
Education, and its financial support is 
greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>4. Current and Future Publications 
a. A special section of the JEE in 2012 will 
be devoted to publication of a limited 
set of papers that were first presented 
at the AEA-CEE and JEE-sponsored 
conference at Stanford University in 
summer 2011. All participants at this 
conference were invited to submit their 
presented papers. A total of 29 papers 
were submitted from which 10 have 
been accepted for publication. The sub-
mitted papers underwent the same peer 
and editorial review as all JEE pub-
lished papers but using an expedited 
schedule. </p>

<p>January 6, 2012 </p>

<p>Report for the Journal of Economic Education 
Submitted to the Committee on Economic 
Education of the American Economic 
Association 
William B. Walstad (JEE Editor) 
Chicago, IL </p>

<p>1. Editors 
a. In January 2011 Paul Grimes stepped 
down as Associate Editor for instruc-
tion after having served in this capac-
ity for the past three years (since 2008). 
The JEE greatly benefitted from Paul's 
thoughtful and effective service. 
b. In January 2011 Tisha Emerson (Baylor 
University) and KimMarie McGoldrick 
(University of Richmond) were </p>

<p>appointed Associate Editors. They are 
primarily responsible for manuscripts 
related to instruction. 
c. Other JEE Associate Editors remain 
in place: David Colander (Middlebury 
College) for the Content section; 
and Bill Goffe (SUNY-Oswego) for 
the Online section. Sam Allgood 
(University of Nebraska-Lincoln) is </p>

<p>primarily responsible for the Research 
section. Responsibility for the Features 
and Information section is shared 
among all editors. </p>

<p>2. Editorial Board 
a. The following people have joined the 
JEE board in 2011: (1) John Taylor, 
Professor of Economics at Stanford; 
(2) Annamaria Lusardi, Professor of </p>

<p>Economics at George Washington 
University (formerly at Dartmouth 
College); and (3) Paul Grimes, former 
JEE Associate Editor and now Business 
Dean at Pittsburg State University. 
b. Other additions to the Board are being 
considered. </p>

<p>3. Publishing and Support 
a. The JEE is published by Taylor and 
Francis (www.taylorandfrancis.com). 
The Taylor and Francis staff has been 
very timely and efficient in the produc-
tion of journal issues. Taylor and Francis 
maintains a Web site for the JEE. </p>

<p>MAY 2012 
 
AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS </p>

<p>b. A call for papers was issued for a 2012 
AEA-CEE session on "Research in 
Economic Education." Publication of 
these papers are being considered for 
the JEE after review. 
c. A special section of the JEE in 2013 
will be devoted to selected papers 
presented at the AEA-CEE and JEE-
sponsored conference at the Boston Fed 
in summer 2012. </p>

<p>5. Editorial Statistics 
a. The table below shows the num-
ber of manuscripts submitted to the 
Journal of Economic Education from 
2008 through 2011 and the disposi-
tion of those manuscripts. Data from </p>

<p>2008-2010 are basically complete 
because there are no manuscripts cur-
rently under review. The acceptance 
rate was 18.64 percent in 2008, 19.40 
percent in 2009, and 17.00 in 2010. The 
overall acceptance rate for submitted 
manuscripts from 2008 through 2010 
was 18.35 percent. This rate has been 
relatively stable over the three years and 
is the best indicator to use for reporting 
purposes. 
b. A total of 213 manuscripts were sub-
mitted in 2011. Many of them are still 
under review or revision; 2011 has a 
lower current acceptance rate (6.10 per-
cent), but it will increase as more manu-
scripts complete the review process. </p>
