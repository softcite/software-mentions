<p>Introduction: Association of vitamin D, inflammation and endothelial dys-
function, beside the classic bone metabolism disorders, may explain the 
pathogenesis of numerous diseases associated with vitamin D deficien-
cy. While large numbers of reports support the relationship of vitamin D 
with inflammation, several reports fail to confirm this relationship. Neutro-
phil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are 
novel and inexpensive markers of inflammation that can be studied in all 
centers. The goal of this study was to investigate the association between 
25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) and inflammation with the novel inflamma-
tory markers NLR and PLR. 
Material and methods: This study was performed retrospectively. Results of 
the simultaneously performed 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, albumin, cal-
cium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and creatinine level measurements 
and complete blood count were recorded. The data of 4120 patients were 
included in the study. 
Results: Between vitamin D deficient and non-deficient groups there were 
significant differences in PLR (p &lt; 0.001) and NLR (p = 0.001). Vitamin D had 
a significant negative correlation with PLR (p &lt; 0.001) and NLR (p &lt; 0.001). 
Multiple regression analysis indicated that 25(OH)D was independently and 
negatively correlated with PLR (OR = 0.994, 95% CI 0.991-0.998, p = 0.02). 
Conclusions: Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and NLR were significantly associ-
ated with 25(OH)D levels, and PLR was found to be an independent predictor 
of 25(OH)D levels. Our study revealed an inverse association of vitamin D 
levels and inflammation with these inexpensive and universally available 
markers. </p>

<p>Hypovitaminosis D is a common and emerging health problem 
worldwide [1]. Vitamin D is an essential component of bone and min-
eral metabolism; its deficiency classically causes growth retardation, 
skeletal deformities in children, and osteomalacia and osteoporosis in 
adults. Moreover, vitamin D plays a role in diseases other than those 
of bone such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome, </p>

<p>insulin resistance, infection, allergy, cancers and 
autoimmune diseases [2-14]. 
Although there are studies that failed to find 
a relationship [10, 15-20], inflammatory cytokines 
such as C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-6 were found 
to be inversely associated with vitamin D levels 
[21-25]. Additionally, there are studies suggesting 
that vitamin D deficiency is associated with ele-
vated TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP concentrations, which 
are correctable by supplementation [4, 26, 27]. 
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and plate-
let-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were introduced 
as easily measured, reproducible, and inexpen-
sive markers to determine inflammation. Neu-
trophil-to-lymphocyte ratio has been found to be 
associated with different types of malignancies, 
metabolic syndrome, infectious diseases, cardio 
vascular disease, end stage renal disease and other 
inflammatory diseases [28-38]. Also PLR has been 
found to be associated with different types of ma-
lignancies, cardiovascular disease and end stage 
renal disease [28, 37, 39-42]. 
The goal of this study was to investigate and 
evaluate the association between 25-hydroxy 
vitamin D (25(OH)D) and inflammation with the 
novel inflammatory markers NLR and PLR. </p>

<p>Material and methods </p>

<p>Study design, data collection and 
procedures </p>

<p>This study was performed retrospectively using 
Ataturk University Hospital database. The data-
base was screened from 2008 until 2013. Results 
of the simultaneously performed measurements 
of 25(OH)D levels by competitive electrochemi-
luminescence protein binding assay (Cobas-601, 
Roche/Cobas Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan); parathy-
roid hormone (PTH) levels by chemiluminescence 
assay (UniCel DXi 800 immunoassay system, 
Beckman Coulter, Fullerton CA, USA); albumin, 
calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
and creatinine levels by spectrophotometric assay 
(AU5800 -Beckman Coulter, Beckman coulter, 
Mishima, Japan); and complete blood count (CBC) 
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton CA, USA) were record-
ed. Patients whose ages were under 18 years, 
patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, high 
creatinine levels (creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl) and 
patients with abnormal lymphocyte (normal val-
ues: 1000-4800/mm 3 ), platelet (normal values: 
150 000-450 000/mm 3 ) and neutrophil (normal 
values: 1500-8000/mm 3 ) count values were ex-
cluded from the evaluation to exclude the effects 
of undesirable factors such as acute infection. In 
repeated applications, initial tests were recorded. 
Study participants' age and gender were recorded. </p>

<p>The data of 4120 patients who met the criteria 
were included in the study. 
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and PLR were 
calculated as the ratio of neutrophils to lympho-
cytes and platelets to lymphocytes respectively. 
Corrected calcium (C-calcium) was calculated by 
a standard formula: (C-calcium = total calcium + 
0.8 × (4 -albumin)). 
Patients were separated into groups according 
to aging stages (young adulthood (18-34 years), 
young middle-age (35-44 years), later middle age 
(45-64 years), early old age (65-74 years), mid-
dle old age (75-84 years), very old age (over 85 
years)). Vitamin D status was classified as vita-
min deficiency (&lt; 20 ng/ml) and non-deficiency 
(&gt; 20 ng/ml) according to Holick et al. [43]. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis </p>

<p>Statistical analyses were carried out using the 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for Social Sciences</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Windows version 15.0</rs> (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive 
statistics for each variable were determined. Re-
sults for continuous variables without normal 
distribution were presented as median (inter-
quartile range (IQR)). Statistically significant dif-
ferences between the groups were determined 
by the c 2 test for categorical variables and the 
Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables 
without normal distribution. Kruskal-Wallis ana-
lysis was used to compare means of several 
groups without normal distribution. Associa-
tions between the variables were explored using 
Spearman's rho (for data that are not normally 
distributed). Binary logistic regression analysis 
was also performed to define variables associat-
ed with 25(OH)D. A p-value less than 0.05 was 
considered significant. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Baseline characteristics and laboratory data 
of patients according to aging stages are given 
in Table I. Briefly, while there were no significant 
differences between groups according to the sex 
distribution, there were statistically significant 
differences with respect to the following vari-
ables between groups: 25(OH)D, PTH, ALP, calcium, 
C-calcium, phosphorus, albumin, creatinine, WBC, 
PLR and NLR. 
When patients were separated into two groups 
according to 25(OH)D levels (group 1 -25(OH)D 
&lt; 20 ng/ml; group 2 -25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/ml), while 
there were no significant differences between 
groups according to age, phosphorus and WBC, 
there were statistically significant differences be-
tween groups for the following variables: PTH, ALP, 
calcium, C-calcium, albumin, creatinine, PLR and 
NLR (Table II). </p>

<p>
The correlations between 25(OH)D and several 
other parameters were tested using bivariate cor-
relation analysis. As shown in Table III, 25(OH)D 
was significantly positively correlated with male 
sex, calcium, C-calcium, phosphorus, albumin, </p>

<p>creatinine, and WBC, and negative correlated with 
age, PTH, ALP, PLR, and NLR. 
We also performed logistic regression analysis 
to define the variables of 25(OH)D (Table IV). Age,

<p>atinine, NLR and PLR were included in this model. 
Sex (male), PTH, calcium, creatinine and PLR were 
found to be independent variables of 25(OH)D. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>This was the first study evaluating the rela-
tionship between vitamin D deficiency and in-
flammation with the novel inflammatory markers 
NLR and PLR. There were three main findings of 
the present study. First, PLR and NLR were sig-
nificantly higher in patients with lower 25(OH)D </p>

<p>levels. Second, 2 5 (OH)D levels were significantly 
correlated with PLR and NLR as well as age, male 
sex and PTH, ALP, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, 
and creatinine levels. Finally, PLR was found to be 
an independent predictor of 25(OH)D levels along 
with PTH, calcium, sex and creatinine. 
Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are con-
sidered to be a global problem, affecting a large 
percentage of the population [1]. Although the as-
sociation of vitamin D deficiency and many chron-
ic inflammatory diseases has been described in 
the literature, there is not a clear consensus re-
garding the relationship between vitamin D and 
inflammatory markers [4-9, 15-24, 26, 27]. 
This relationship was studied with cross sec-
tional studies and clinical trials. Amer et al. stud-
ied the association of 25(OH)D and CRP in 15 167 
patients and observed a statistically significant 
inverse relation between 25(OH)D at levels &lt; 21 
ng/ml and CRP in a cross sectional study [21]. 
They reported that 25(OH)D at a level ≥ 21 ng/ml 
is associated with an increase in serum CRP. The 
authors concluded that the role of vitamin D sup-
plementation to reduce inflammation might be 
beneficial only among those with a lower serum 
25(OH)D. In several other cross sectional stud-
ies, low 25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated 
with inflammatory markers such as high-sensi-
tivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, TNF-α and 
asymmetric dimethylarginine concentrations -
a marker of endothelial dysfunction [22-25, 44]. 
Our study supports the findings of studies men-
tioned above and revealed an inverse association 
between 25(OH)D levels and the novel inflamma-
tory markers NLR and PLR. 
In contrast to these studies, several studies 
have found no association of 25(OH)D with in-</p>

flammatory markers such as IL-6 and hs-CRP 
[15, 20]. Yildirim et al. studied the association 
of 25(OH)D with CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate and white blood cells (WBC) in the popula-
tion with and without chronic kidney disease [16]. 
They could not find a significant relation between 
inflammatory markers and 25(OH)D levels. There 
was also no association between 25(OH)D levels 
and WBC in our study, while there were statisti-
cally significant relations between 25(OH)D levels 
and PLR and NLR. These findings can be attributed 
to the sensitivity of NLR and PLR. Moreover, PLR 
was found to be superior to NLR in terms of in-
flammation [28]. Also, PLR was superior to NLR in 
our study. While PLR was a predictor of 25(OH)D, 
this association was not seen with NLR in logistic 
regression analysis. 
In addition to the cross-sectional studies, the 
association of 25(OH)D and inflammatory mark-
ers has been investigated in clinical trials and con-
flicting results have been reported. In a 12-week 
randomized controlled trial, Shab-Bidar et al. stud-
ied the association of 25(OH)D supplementation 
and inflammatory markers in patients receiving 
a vitamin D fortified drink (1000 IU/day 25(OH)D), 
compared with those receiving an unfortified 
drink [27]. Comparison of the changes of the vari-
ables revealed that a significant increase in serum 
25(OH)D was accompanied by a significant de-
crease in TNF-α, IL-6, hs-CRP, and serum amyloid A, 
and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cyto-
kine IL-10. In another clinical trial, Dutta et al. 
randomized prediabetic individuals into three 
groups (25(OH)D &lt; 30 ng/ml, receiving cholecal-
ciferol; 25(OH)D &lt; 30 ng/ml, receiving calcium 
carbonate; and 25(OH)D &gt; 30 ng/ml, also receiv-
ing calcium carbonate) and followed them over 
2 years [4]. At the end of the study, the authors 
reported improvement in glycemic status, insulin 
resistance and inflammation following an increase 
in serum 25(OH)D levels, in the 25(OH)D receiving 
group. A study performed by Timms et al. in a pop-
ulation free of known diabetes or major illness 
revealed that vitamin D insufficiency was asso-
ciated with increased CRP, correctable by supple-
mentation [26]. In contrast to those studies, some 
clinical trials have failed to demonstrate beneficial 
effects of 25(OH)D supplementation on inflamma-
tory markers [17-19, 45]. 
The PLR and NLR were used to determine in-
flammation in different types of malignancies, 
metabolic syndrome, infectious diseases, cardio-
vascular disease, end stage renal disease and oth-
er inflammatory diseases [28-37, 39-42]. How-
ever, these easily measured, reproducible, and 
inexpensive markers are not used to determine 
the association of inflammation and vitamin D de-
ficiency, on which there is no clear consensus yet. 
In this study, we observed that NLR and PLR levels </p>

<p>tended to rise with increasing age. Additionally, 
without a significant effect of age, in the vitamin D 
deficient group compared to the non-deficient 
group, PLR and NLR were high. 
There are studies that support an association 
of endothelial dysfunction and vitamin D defi-
ciency and explain the relation between vitamin D 
deficiency and inflammation with endothelial dys-
function [22, 44, 46, 47]. Furthermore, there are 
studies revealing the relation of NLR, PLR and en-
dothelial dysfunction [37, 48, 49]. In this perspec-
tive, NLR and PLR might be simple and inexpen-
sive endothelial dysfunction markers in vitamin D 
deficiency. 
Limitations of this study include the weakness 
of a retrospective study and the cross-sectional 
nature. Based on our data, seasonal differences, 
the role of obesity, and the reason for the patients' 
admission to the hospital were not investigated. 
Despite the difficulties in using retrospective 
study results, the strength of our study is the large 
cohort of patients. 
In conclusion, PLR and NLR were significantly 
higher in patients with lower 25(OH)D levels, 
and PLR was found to be an independent predic-
tor of 25(OH)D levels. Our study demonstrated an 
inverse association of vitamin D levels and inflam-
mation with these inexpensive and universally 
available markers. Further and larger studies are 
required to confirm our findings, and to better 
elucidate the relationship between vitamin D defi-
ciency, NLR and PLR. </p>
