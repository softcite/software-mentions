<p>Most forms of chronic liver disease are associated 
with the development of hepatic fibros is and cirrhosis. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma frequently occurs in hepatitis 
B or C virus-related chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis . In 
particular, cirrhosis has been regarded as a high-risk 
factor for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. 
A large body of evidence indicates that MMPs play 
a crucial role in hepatic fibrosis, and enhanced MMPs 
activity has been associated with increases in invas ive 
and metastatic potential in many types of human 
carcinoma, including hepatocellular carcinoma 1 1 -1 4 ) . 
In general, a number of control mechanisms exist to 
regulate MMPs activity in tissues. These mechanisms 
operate at different levels, including gene transcription, 
proenzyme activation and inhibition of activated enzymes. 
The latter mechanisms are regulated by tissue inhibitors 
of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which bind to the catalytic 
site of the active enzyme as well as to the carboxyl 
terminus of the proenzyme, thereby inhibiting its activity 
and preventing its activation 15 -1 8 ) . 
TIMPs bind strongly and stoicheometrically to active 
form of MMPs and inactivate them. TIMP-1 and 
TIMP-2 also form tight binding complexes with 
proMMP-9 and proMMP-2, respectively, to inhibit their 
activation 1 5 -18 ) . The imbalance of MMPs and TIMPs 
may contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis 
and tumor invasion and metastasis. Therefore, it is 
important to understand the role of TIMPs in hepa-
tocellular carcinoma. 
We examined localization of both transcripts and 
protein of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in s urgical specimen 
pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma and nontumoral liver 
using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, 
and compared it with clinicopathological characteristics . </p>

<p>1. Tumor s pecimens </p>

<p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks 
were obtained from 25 patients who underwent sur-
gery for hepatocellular carcinoma at Chonnam National 
University Hospital from January 1997 to December 
1998. All pathologic slides were reviewed and adeq-

<p>The grade of tumor differentiation was as follows: 
well differentiated in 4 patients, moderately differen-
tiated in 12 patients, and poorly differentiated in 9 
patients. Tumors were infiltrative in 9 patients and en-
capsulated in 16 patients. Capsular invas ion was pre-
sent in 5 of the 16 patients with encapsulated tumors, 
and satellite nodules were present in 10 patients, with 
vascular invasion detected in 8 patients (Table 1). </p>

<p>2. In situ hybridization </p>

<p>For in s itu hybridization, two biotinylated oligon-
ucleotide probes complementary to TIMP-1 (TGTGG-
GTGGGGTGGGACACAGGTGC) and TIMP-2 (CCA-
CTTCCTTCTCACTGACCGC) mRNA were synthesized. 
All in situ hybridization experiments were carried out 
using manual capillary action technology on the 
Micro-Probe staining system (Fisher Scientific, Pitts-
burgh, PA) with the modified one-hour method of 
Park et al 1 9 ) . Briefly, the slides were rapidly deparaf-
finized, cleared and rehydrated. The tissues were then 
digested with pepsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 2 
mg/mL for 1 minute at 110¡É. The probe was applied 
to the s lides and the tiss ues were heated at 110¡É 
for 10 minutes to denature any seconda ry mRNA 
structures . The hybridization of the probe a nd 
mRNA target was performed by exposing the slides 
to a microwave oven in which the te mperature was 
gradually decreased from 110¡É to 45¡É (110¡É for 
1 min, 95¡É for 7 min, 85¡É for 7 min, 65¡É for 5 
min, 45¡É for 20 minutes , res pectively). The biotiny-
lated hybrids were detected with stre ptavidin-hors-
e radis h peroxidase (Zymed, Sa nFra ncisco, CA) for 7 
minutes at 45¡É . Afte r pre incubation in 3-amino-
9-ethylcarbazole (AEC, S igma, St. Louis, MO) for 7 
minutes at 45¡É, the tiss ues we re was hed with 
distilled wate r. Following the chromogen reaction, the 
tiss ues were counte rsta ined with hematoxylin solution 
(Research Ge netics, Huntsville , AL), washed with 
distilled water, air-dried and cove r-slipped with 
Universal mount (Resea rch Ge netics , Huntsville, AL). 
In situ hybridization for negative control was 
performed with probe diluent in hybridization. To 
eva luate the degree of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA 
expression in tumor tiss ue , the sta ining inte ns ity was 
divided into the following three groups ; 0, negative 
s igna l; 1, wea k signal; 2, strong s igna l. Assess ment 
of express ion was eva luated by two independent 
observers without knowledge of the clinical 
outcomes . Consens us scores we re ass igned for </p>

<p>each case by reviewing the s lides with discrepancies 
in scoring. All sections on which the two observers 
disagreed were re-evaluated and after discuss ion 
there was total agreement on the classification. </p>

<p>3. Immunohistoche mistry </p>

<p>All procedures for immunohistochemical staining were 
done by the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Micro-Probe staining system</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Fisher Scientific</rs>, Pittsburgh, PA) based on capillary action 2 0 ) . 
Paraffin sections of 4¥ìm in thickness with mounted probe 
on slides were immunostained with anti-mouse 
monoclonal antibodies for TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 antigens 
(NeoMarkers, Union, CA) by the avidin-biotin peroxidase 
complex method 2 0 ) . Sections were dewaxed using absolute 
alcohol. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwave for 
7 minutes in citrate buffer (2.1g/L monohydrate citric acid in 
distilled water, pH 6.0). After three washes in universal 
buffer, the slides were immersed in 0.6% hydrogen 
peroxide for 5 minutes to block the endogenous peroxidase 
activity. The primary antibodies, used at concentrations of 
1:120, 1:100 respectively, were diluted in phosphate-
buffered saline supplemented with 5% normal horse serum 
and 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with 
tissues overnight at room temperature. The slides were 
washed in universal buffer and incubated with biotinylated 
affinity-purified anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Sigma, St. 
Louis, MO) for 7 minutes at 45¡É. After three washes with 
universal buffer, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase detection 
system (Biomeda, Foster, CA) was applied for 7 minutes. 
As the final step, the slides were developed for 15 minutes 
with the enzyme substrate, 3 amino-9-ethyl carbazole 
(AEC, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and counterstained with 
hematoxylin solution for 1 minute (Research Genetics, 
Huntsville, AL). After dehydration, the tissue was sealed 
with a universal mount (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). </p>

<p>4. Statistical Analys is </p>

<p>Significant bivariate associations were tested for all 
study variables by ¥ö 2 test and Fisher's exact test. The 
statistical software program used was Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences (<rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs>/PC+ <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">8.0</rs>, 
Chicago, IL, USA). A p -value of less than 0.05 was 
accepted as statistically significant. </p>

Disordered MMP activity could theoretically contribute 
to such pathological states as progressive hepatic 
fibros is and cirrhosis. Advanced hepatic fibrosis and 
cirrhosis are generally considered to be irreversible 
conditions even after removal of the injurious agent. 
Moreover, the development of cirrhosis is characteri-
zed by a diminution of liver MMPs activity, implying 
that the capacity of the diseased liver to remodel the 
fibrotic matrix is cortically reduced. In studies under-
taken to measure MMPs activity in hepatic fibrosis, a 
general pattern emerges. Initially there is a reversible 
phase with active ECM remodelling and detectable 
MMPs activity. In late disease, fibrosis becomes 
irreversible and, at this point, MMPs activity falls 2 2 -2 5 ) . 
These changes of MMPs activity operate at different 
levels and control the synthesis of the proenzyme, the 
secretion of the proenzyme that requires activation 
and the presence of the metalloproteinases inhibitors. 
First, all of them are secreted in latent forms (proen-</p>

<p>zyme) and must be activated for the express ion of 
their activities. Second, the metalloproteinase activities 
are regulated by common metalloproteinase inhibitors 
secreted from various types of cells, such as 
connective tissue cells , vascular endothelial cells and 
tumor cells. 
Our study showed that, in nontumorous portion with 
either chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, expression of 
TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were detected in many cell 
types, including hepatocytes, bile duct cells, sinusoidal 
lining cells and stromal cells. These results suggest 
that TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 might be involved in hepatic 
fibros is and cirrhosis. Previous reports demonstrated 
that express ion of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was increased 
in human cirrhotic livers in comparison to normal 
liver 2 6 ,2 7 ) . Furthermore, Fukuda et al reported that the 
expression of TIMP-1 was observed in fibrous tissue, 
especially in the capsule of hepatocellular carcinoma 2 8 ) . 
These results may indicate a relationship between the 
increased expression of TIMP-1 and hepatic fibros is, 
as well as a relations hip between such increased 
expression and the hepatocellular carcinoma capsule 
formation. 
Iredale et al reported that the cellular distribution of 
TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 appear to be similar, although 
only TIMP-1 is generally found in large amounts 2 9 ) . 
Our study also showed that a clear difference in 
TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 express ion was not observed 
between tumorous tissue, nontumorous tissue and the 
portions of the tumors adjacent to the caps ules, and 
the intensity of TIMP-2 expression was generally 
weaker than TIMP-1. 
In general, an important step in tumor invasion and 
metastasis is the proteolytic breakdown of ECM in 
normal tissue surrounding the tumor. Among proteol-
ytic enzymes, the MMPs are the most critical part of 
this step. 
TIMPs concomitantly secreted into the cellular micro-
environment interact with MMPs at several levels to 
stabilize latent enzymes , inhibit active enzymes and 
modulate the binding of soluble MMPs to surface-
bound MMPs , and thereby control the net MMPs 
activity. Therefore, TIMPs are critica l in regulating 
ECM degradation a nd tumor invas ion and meta-
stas is. Although some studies s uggest a role of 
TIMPs in preve nting tumor invas ion, othe rs s how a 
complex re lations hip betwee n MMPs a nd TIMPs in 
which the TIMPs we re not shown to prevent tumor 
invas ion 3 0 -3 4 ) . </p>

<p>This paradoxica l res ult indicates that TIMP-1 a nd 
TIMP-2 also exhibit othe r roles than the inhibition of 
MMPs , which may affect the maligna nt pote ntial. 
Hayakawa et a l 3 5 ,3 6 ) re ported that TIMP-1 a nd 
TIMP-2 molecules have growth promoting activity. 
Howeve r, it re mains unclea r whethe r TIMPs stimul-
ate the growth of hepatoce llula r carcinoma ce lls . In 
our study, a clear difference in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 
expression was not obse rved between tumorous 
tiss ue, nontumorous tiss ue and the portions of the 
tumors adjace nt to the ca ps ules . Also, inte ns ity of 
TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA expression did not 
correlate with variable clinicopathological characteristics. 
The effect of TIMPs on tumor invasion a nd 
metastas is a re pa rticularly complex. TIMPs synthesis 
has been known to be regulated by growth factors 
a nd cytokines such as tra nsforming growth factor-¥â 
1, inte rle ukin and tumor necros is factor-¥á 3 7 ,3 8 ) . 
The influence of other genes, such as those coding 
for growth factors and metastasis suppressor and 
dominant metastas is genes , on the possible modul-
ation of MMP/TIMP, together with possible repercus-
sions for the invas ive and metastatic properties of the 
cancer cell, also needs to be studied in depth. 
In summa ry, expression of TIMP-1 a nd TIMP-2 
was found in tumor ce lls , hepatocyte , s inusoidal 
cells, e ndothe lia l ce lls a nd stroma l ce lls . Express ion 
of TIMP-1 a nd TIMP-2 was observed in tumorous 
tiss ue, in nontumorous tiss ue and in the portions of 
the tumors adjacent to the capsules . Express ion of 
TIMP-1 was stronge r than that of TIMP-2 and 
inte ns ity of TIMP-1 a nd TIMP-2 mRNA express ion 
did not corre late with va ria ble clinicopathologica l 
cha racteristics . 
Further investigations for TIMPs' unknown functional 
role are needed. </p>
