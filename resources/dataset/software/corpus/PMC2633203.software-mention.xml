<p>Reactive oxygen species have been known to be an important factor in the patho-
genesis of hypertension. Bilirubin, one of the metabolites of heme degraded by heme 
oxygenase, is a potent anti-oxidant. We verified the effect of serum bilirubin level on 
the incidence of hypertension in normotensive subjects. We grouped 1,208 normoten-
sive subjects by the criterion of the highest quintile value of serum bilirubin, 1.1 mg/dL. 
The incidence of hypertension was higher in group 1 with bilirubin less than 1.1 mg/ 
dL than in group 2 with bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL or more (186/908 vs. 43/300, p=0.018). 
The relative risk for hypertension was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.99), 
p=0.048 in group 2 compared to group 1 by Cox's proportional hazard model. 
Among the groups stratified by gender, smoking, and liver function status, the 
group 2 showed a lower risk of hypertension in females and in non-smokers. In 
conclusion, a mild increase within the physiological range of serum bilirubin con-
centration was negatively correlated with the incidence of hypertension. The effect 
of bilirubin on the development of hypertension was more evident in females and 
in non-smokers. </p>

<p>Bilirubin and Hypertension </p>

<p>S51 </p>

<p>jects compared to 272 normotensive and 89 treated hyperten-
sive subjects (20). The bilirubin level was not different between 
the normotensive and treated hypertensive subjects (20). 
In the present study, we investigated the relationship between 
serum bilirubin level and the incidence of hypertension in 
normotensive subjects who had undergone repeated routine 
health check-ups. We also analyzed the data in subgroups 
stratified with possible important confounding factors affect-
ing serum bilirubin levels, such as gender, hepatic function-
al status, and status of smoking (21). </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Study subjects </p>

<p>The institutional review board had approved this study. 
The 3, 668 study candidates aged 18 yr or more had under-
gone routine health check-ups twice or more during the 10-
yr period from September 1995 to August 2005 in the out-
patient clinic at the health promotion center of Seoul Nation-
al University Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Among them, we select-
ed 1, 208 subjects with systolic blood pressure less than 120 
mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg who 
had not taken any anti-hypertensive medicine on the first health 
check-up (Fig. 1). The selected subjects had undergone health 
check-ups a mode of 3 times (range: 2-12 times) at an inter-
val of 8 months (range 4-51 months) during 129 months. </p>

<p>Clinical data </p>

<p>The subjects filled up the questionnaires by themselves 
about their smoking habit, amount, intake habit, and history 
of medical diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes mel-
litus. Blood samples for laboratory tests were taken after 12 hr 
fasting. The following information was obtained from elec-
tronic medical records as well as the questionnaire items: hei-</p>

<p>ght, weight, age, sex, history of diabetes mellitus, medication 
for diabetes mellitus, history of hypertension, antihyperten-
sive medication, blood pressure, serum total bilirubin, ala-
nine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
anti-hepatitis B virus surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B virus 
surface antibody, anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, serum glu-
cose, serum albumin, serum uric acid, serum cholesterol, serum 
triglyceride, serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol, C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, and the findings 
of urinalysis by dipstick and microscopy. Medical history and 
blood pressure were also taken and physical examination was 
performed by physicians at the health promotion center. The 
blood pressure was measured once in the sitting position after 
5 min resting using a mercury sphygmomanometer. The 
systolic pressure was measured when the first sound was heard 
at the beginning of phase I of Korotkoff sound. The diastolic 
pressure was measured from the moment the sound could not 
be heard at the end of phase IV of Korotkoff sound. In some 
case, such as subjects with aortic regurgitation, the muffling 
of phase IV Korotkoff sound continued at the lowest level. 
In that case, we took the diastolic blood pressure at the begin-
ning of phase IV of Korotkoff sound. 
We defined newly developed hypertension as systolic blood 
pressure 140 mmHg or more, diastolic blood pressure 90 
mmHg or more, or newly taken anti-hypertensive medicine. 
We also defined the proteinuria as 2+ or more by the urinary 
dipstick test and hematuria as 5 or more RBCs in the spun 
urine sample observed by light microscopy at 400-times mag-
nification. We defined liver dysfunction as ALT 40 U/L or 
more or AST 40 U/L or more. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis </p>

<p><rs type="software">The SPSS (SPSS version 12.0, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) pack-
age was used for statistical analysis</rs>. The quintile values of 
serum bilirubin in the 1, 208 subjects were 0.6 mg/dL, 0.8 
mg/dL, 1.0 mg/dL, and 1.1 mg/dL and we grouped the sub-
jects according to the highest quintile value of serum biliru-
bin 1.1 mg/dL. Differences in proportions among the subject 
groups were compared by the Pearson's chi-square test. Group 
differences for continuous variables were assessed by the Stu-
dent t-test. We defined the event period as the duration from 
the date of the first health check-up to the date when subjects 
had become hypertensive during follow-up health check-up 
(s). We compared the cumulative incidence of hypertension 
between the bilirubin groups by Log-rank test. To determine 
whether the bilirubin category was associated independently 
with the incidence of hypertension, we used Cox's proportion-
al hazard model adjusted for serum albumin and univariate 
risk factors for the development of hypertension. We checked 
the violation of the proportional hazard assumption by par-
tial residual plot against time for each covariate and log minus 
log plots (LML) for categorical covariates, such as bilirubin 
group. The average values of residuals for covariates includ-</p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Subject characteristics at initial examination </p>

<p>A total of 605 males and 603 females, aged 47.1±9.0 yr, 
were enrolled. Group 1 included 908 subjects and group 2 
included 300 subjects. The frequency of females was higher 
in group 1 than in group 2. In group 1, the levels of mean 
blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, serum ALT, serum 
uric acid, serum albumin and serum creatinine were lower 
than in group 2 (Table 1). The differences of these clinical 
parameters between the two groups were mainly due to the 
gender discrepancy between the groups, as confirmed by the 
absence of these differences after the subjects were stratified </p>

<p>by gender. The current smoking rate of the subjects was not 
different between the groups. There were no differences in 
the presence of hepatitis B virus surface antigenemia and 
anti-hepatitis C virus antibody. The frequency of liver dys-
function was slightly, but not significantly, higher in group 
2 than in group 1. </p>

<p>The incidence of hypertension </p>

<p>During health check-ups, hypertension was developed in 
229 out of 1, 208 subjects (19.0%). The incidence of hyper-
tension was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 
(186/908 vs. 43/300, p=0.018). Kaplan-Meier analysis also 
showed that the cumulative incidence of hypertension was 
higher in group 1 than in group 2 (Fig. 2). 
The subgroup which developed hypertension showed high-
er frequencies of male and diabetes mellitus. The initial val-
ues of age, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic blood pres-
sure, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, fasting serum 
glucose, serum uric acid, serum cholesterol, serum triglyc-
eride, C-reactive protein (CRP), and AST were higher, while </p>

<p>Bilirubin and Hypertension </p>

<p>S53 </p>

<p>the values of HDL cholesterol, and serum bilirubin were 
lower in subjects who developed hypertension than in the 
normotensive subjects (Table 2). Biliurbin group 2 had a 
lower risk to develop hypertension than group 1 after partial 
or full adjustment for serum albumin and univariate factors. 
The relative risk (RR) for the development of hypertension 
was 29% lower in group 2 than in group 1 (Table 3). The 
other risk factors to the development of hypertension were 
older age (yr) (RR, 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-
1.04], p&lt;0.001), presence of diabetes mellitus (RR, 1.99 [95% 
CI, 1.31-3.02], p=0.001), higher body mass index (BMI, 
kg/m 2 ) (RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.06-1.16], p&lt;0.001), and higher 
level of systolic blood pressure (mmHg) (RR, 1.05 [95% 
CI, 1.02-1.07], p&lt;0.001). </p>

<p>Incidence of hypertension in the stratified subgroups </p>

<p>The difference of cumulative incidence of hypertension acco-
rding to bilirubin level was significant in the female group 
but not in the male group (Fig. 3). In females, RR for the devel-
opment of hypertension was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.17-0.91, p= 
0.028) in bilirubin group 2 compared to bilirubin group 1 by

<p>hypertension was lower in the bilirubin group 2 than in the 
bilirubin group 1 (35/260 vs. 162/820, p=0.022). The cumu-
lative incidence of hypertension in subjects without liver dys-
function was also lower in group 2 than in group 1 but the 
bilirubin group was not an independent risk factor to hyper-
tension by Cox's proportional hazard model. 
The bilirubin level was not associated with the incidence 
of hypertension in current smokers, whereas in non-smokers, 
bilirubin group 2 had lower risk of hypertension than group 
1 (Log rank test, p=0.023). In non-smokers, RR for hyper-
tension in group 2 was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.34-0.82, p=0.005) 
adjusted with independent risk factors to hypertension com-
pared to group 1. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>The concentration of serum bilirubin is affected by gender, 
smoking status, fasting status, as well as diseased conditions. 
In a previous report, the individual changes in serum biliru-
bin concentration due to fasting averaged 0.18 mg/dL for 
women and 0.24 mg/dL for men (fasting values minus non-
fasting values) (22). The serum bilirubin level is lower in fe-
males than in males (22, 23) and is lower in current smokers 
than in ex-smokers or non-smokers (21, 23). In this study, 
subjects were instructed to fast for at least 12 hr before blood 
sampling and we assumed that the serum bilirubin levels were 
measured after a similar fasting period among the subjects. 
We stratified the data according to the factors of gender, cur-
rent smoking, and liver dysfunction status in order to elimi-
nate the confounding factors which affect serum bilirubin co-</p>

<p>ncentration. 
The subjects with higher bilirubin level showed a lower in-
cidence of hypertension than did the subjects with lower biliru-
bin level, especially in females and in non-smokers. 
In an animal hypertensive model using hyperbilirubinemic 
Gunn rats infused with angiotensin II, the rise in systolic blood 
pressure was markedly blunted compared to that in control 
rats (15). The oxidative stress was attenuated in the Gunn rat 
and in the aortic rings from angiotensin II-infused rats by 
bilirubin (15). Increased ROS has been demonstrated in the 
SHR (24), DOCA-salt hypertensive (25), and Dahl salt-sen-
sitive rats (26), as well as in hypertension induced by angio-
tensin II (27). In humans, enhanced production of superox-
ide and hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated in untreat-
ed individuals with mild to moderate hypertension. This abnor-
mality can be reversed by the control of hypertension with beta 
blockers or ACE inhibitors (28). Thus, mild hyperbilirubine-
mia may have, at least in part, an anti-hypertensive role by 
the quenching of oxidative stress (15). 
The bilirubin group was a risk factor to the development 
of hypertension only in the non-smokers. Bilirubin is an endo-
genous antioxidant and is destroyed by ROS (14). Smoking 
generates free radical species (29) which might consume the 
serum antioxidant, bilirubin, and enhance UDP-glucuronyl-
transferase activity (30) which is inversely related to serum 
bilirubin concentration. Smoking itself also increases blood 
pressure and aortic stiffness in humans (31). Therefore, the 
antioxidant effect of bilirubin can be decreased in the high-
er level of free radicals generated by current smoking and the 
potential anti-hypertensive capacity of bilirubin might be also 
reduced. In, this study, the rate of current smoking was much </p>

<p>Bilirubin and Hypertension </p>

<p>higher in males than in females, which is a possible explana-
tion for why the relationship between bilirubin and hyper-
tension incidence was evident only in females. The other pos-
sible explanation for the different effect of bilirubin on the 
development of hypertension between genders is the sex-dif-
ference of HO activity to stress. Trauma and hemorrhage dou-
bled the hepatic HO-1 expression in female rats compared 
with male rats (32). 
Subjects with liver dysfunction had more risk factors to 
develop hypertension, such as higher BMI, higher frequency 
of diabetes mellitus, and higher rate of hyperuricemia, com-
pared to subjects with normal liver function (data not shown). 
The bilirubin effect on the development of hypertension may 
have been overwhelmed by those risk factors in subjects with 
liver dysfunction. In subjects with normal liver function, biliru-
bin effect on the hypertension was not consistent and depen-
dent on the specific criterion of bilirubin. The criterion of 
0.9 mg/dL was significant (data were not shown) but 1.1 mg/ 
dL was not a risk factor to hypertension. So, there might be 
some other statistical or clinical confounding factors when we 
confine the group to the subjects with normal liver function. 
A serum bilirubin level of 10 μ M/L was suggested as a cut-
point for the discrimination of cardiovascular risk but other 
cut-points have been proposed in other studies (19). In this 
study, the serum bilirubin level assigned to discriminate the 
risk of hypertension was 1.1 mg/dL. It seemed that the appro-
priate bilirubin level to discriminate the risk of hypertension 
might be different in clinical situations because the bilirubin 
group with the criterion of 0.9 mg/dL in the non-smokers also 
the independent risk factor to the incidence of hypertension, 
which was lower than the criterion of 1.1 mg/dL in whole 
subjects (data were not shown). That implies a relatively lower 
level of bilirubin would be sufficient to protect the develop-
ment of hypertension in subjects with a lower risk of hyper-
tension. 
This study suffered several limitations. Firstly, blood pres-
sure was measured just once in the sitting position using a 
mercury sphygmomanometer. We asked subjects about their 
smoking habit, duration of smoking, and amount of smok-
ing but could only get information on the smoking habit 
(current smoker or non-current smoker) at a reasonable rate 
among the subjects. We therefore could not analyze the effect 
of duration and smoking amount on the development of hyper-
tension. Although the subjects were asked to fast for at least 
12 hr before the blood tests, we did not confirm the exact fast-
ing period before the measurement of serum bilirubin con-
centration. We used the unit of mg/dL for serum bilirubin 
concentration although the SI units (μ M/L) are more infor-
mative and better able to discriminate serum bilirubin lev-
els within the physiological range (19). We did not have infor-
mation about age at menopause and estrogen replacement ther-
apy in women which could affect on the development of hyper-
tension. But, the mean age of female was not different between 
two bilirubin groups (p=0.072) and the number of females </p>

<p>aged more than 47 yr, which is the mean age at menopause 
in Korean women (33), was not different between bilirubin 
groups, either (p=0.086). In younger subjects aged less than 
50 yr, RR for the development of hypertension was 0.605 
(95% CI, 0.372-0.984, p=0.043) in bilirubin group 2 com-
pared to bilirubin group 1 and, in older subjects aged 50 yr 
or more, RR for the development of hypertension was not 
different between bilirubin groups (p=0.299). Although we 
could not assure whether the menopause and the estrogen 
replacement therapy were confounding factors to the relation-
ship between bilirubin group and the incidence of hyperten-
sion in older subjects, the bilirubin effect on the hypertension 
was at least meaningful in younger subjects. 
In conclusion, a mild increase within the physiological range 
of serum bilirubin concentration was negatively correlated 
with the incidence of hypertension in subjects with normal 
blood pressure. The effect of bilirubin on the development of 
hypertension was more evident in females and in non-smokers. </p>
