<p>1 1   1 The study by Kanwar and Evanson (2001) illustrates some of the issues that arise in these kinds of studies. 
They have two fi ve-year averages on 31 countries for the period 1981-1990. They fi nd support for the idea 
that higher patent protection leads to higher research and development spending as a fraction of GDP. 
However, a different story seems equally plausible. Countries with a larger market can more easily pay the 
fi xed costs of innovation. Indeed, one perspective is that their data essentially compares countries with 
relatively small economies, little intellectual property protection, and low R&amp;D spending with countries 
with relatively larger economies, greater intellectual property protection, and higher R&amp;D spending. For 
example, R&amp;D spending as a fraction of GDP in their data ranges from a ten-year average of 0.2 percent in 
Jordan to 2.8 percent in Sweden. If we combine their data with GDP data from The 1990 CIA World Fact Book 
to take account of the size of the economy, increasing the strength of intellectual property protection from 
0 to 1 to 2 on their fi ve-point scale does increase R&amp;D expenditure. But as intellectual property protection 
is increased further, the gains to R&amp;D expenditure levels then falls. Even at the lower levels, we are probably 
observing primarily the effect of foreign direct investment: that is, among poor countries with near-zero 
intellectual property protection, increases bring in more foreign investment and in doing so directly raise 
R&amp;D spending. In higher-income countries with larger economies, foreign investment is not an issue, and 
increases in intellectual property have little or no effect on innovation. </p>

<p>2 For a sense of these controversies, Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Griffi th, and Howitt (2005) fi nd an 
"inverted-U" relationship between the extent of competition, as measured by the inverse of mark-ups, 
and a measure of patenting activity, based on a dataset of US patents of UK fi rms. In other words, they 
fi nd that the maximum innovative effort (as measured by patents) occurs at some "intermediate" posi-
tion between a high and low level of competition. However, Hashmi (2011) reexamines the inverted-U 
relationship using data from publicly traded US manufacturing fi rms and fi nds a robust positive relation-
ship between the inverse of markups and citation-weighted patents. Correa (2012) reexamines the same 
dataset of UK fi rms and shows that the prediction of an inverted-U is overturned when allowing for the 
possibility that innovations follow a "memory process," where the current probability of introducing 
a new innovation increases when a fi rm successfully innovated in the previous period. He also fi nds a 
structural break in the data in 1981, when the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was established 
to hear appeals of patent cases. Overall, Correa fi nds a positive innovation-competition relationship for 
the memory industries before the 1982 reform, but no relationship between innovation and competition 
for those industries that he classifi es as memory-less. </p>

tion of a single action that is to be performed to order the identifi ed item; 
and in response to only the indicated single action being performed, sending 
to a server system a request to order the identifi ed item whereby the item is 
ordered independently of a shopping cart model and the order is fulfi lled to 
complete a purchase of the item. </p>

<p>The idea of taking a single action to accomplish a goal is hardly innovative, and 
applying the idea of taking a single action to making a purchase is obvious to anybody 
who has ever used a soft drink machine. Purchases were already being made over 
the Internet in 1999. It was thus clear that orders would be made by a credit card, 
and either the credit card information would be provided at the time of the transac-
tion, or stored in advance by the retailer. Either way, the user must identify itself 
when the purchase is made. Those obvious steps are exactly what Amazon describes 
in its patent, albeit with a few fl ow charts thrown into the eleven-page patent appli-
cation. But through the fog of those fl ow charts, it is relatively easy to see that the 
verbal description of the single-click procedure applies equally well to what happens 
on the Amazon site and to what happens in front of millions of vending machines 
every day. The Amazon patent was reexamined by the US Patent Offi ce starting in 
May 2006. After a preliminary fi nding that, indeed, "obvious" means "obvious" even </p>

small bites, here is our list of small reforms that could be easily implemented. </p>

<p>1) Patents are time limited, which makes it relatively easy to phase them out by 
phasing in ever shorter patent durations. This conservative approach also </p>

<p>The Case Against Patents 19 </p>

<p>has the advantage that if reducing patent terms indeed has a measurable 
effect on innovation, the process can be reversed. 
2) Stop the rising tide that, since the early 1980s, has extended the set of what 
can be patented and has shifted the legal and judicial balance substantially 
in favor of patent holders. 
3) Because competition fosters productivity growth, antitrust and competition 
policies should seek to limit patents when they are hindering innovation. 
This policy may be of particular relevance for high-tech sectors, from soft-
ware to bioengineering, to medical products and pharmaceuticals. 
4) Current international trade negotiations that affect patents often occur 
as part of either the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights (TRIPS), which was signed in 1995 as part of the World Trade 
Organization negotiations, or as part of the World Intellectual Property 
Organization, an agency of the United Nations. The nature of these agree-
ments and organizations is well indicated by the use of the propaganda term 
"intellectual property" in their titles. In both cases, these talks are often 
focused on how to prevent ideas from high-income countries from being used 
in low-income countries-what we would characterize as essentially a neo-
mercantilist approach toward free trade in goods and ideas. We should be 
highly cautious about this agenda. Within a couple of decades, the "balance 
of trade in ideas" between the US and European economies and emerging 
economies in Asia might easily equalize or reverse. Engaging in "mercantilism 
of ideas" may seem favorable to certain large US fi rms now, but such rules may 
become costly to the US economy if they are applied to protect patents held 
in the future by producers in the now-developing Asian economies. 
5) If the US economy is to have patents, we may want to start tailoring their 
length and breadth to different sectoral needs. Substantial empirical work 
needs to be done to implement this properly, although a vast legal literature 
is already pointing in this direction. 
6) Patents should not be granted based only on technological insights, but 
should also take economic evidence into account. For example, if an inven-
tion is easy to copy or has a high fi xed cost, then patent protection to pro-
vide an incentive for the inventor may be more suitable. Ultimately, patents 
should be awarded only when strictly needed on economic grounds, as 
spelled out earlier. 
7) We advocate returning to the rule prior to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 accord-
ing to which the results of federally subsidized research cannot lead to pat-
ents, but should be available to all market participants. This reform would 
be particularly useful for encouraging the dissemination of innovation and 
heightening competition in the pharmaceutical industry. 
8) In several industries, notably pharmaceuticals, it would be useful to rethink 
all of the government policies that bear on incentives for invention. The 
broad point is that there are a number of ways to reduce the risks and cost of 
developing new drugs, rather than just trying to ratchet up patent protection. </p>



<p>In general, public policy should aim to decrease patent monopolies gradu-
ally but surely, and the ultimate goal should be the abolition of patents. After 
six decades of further study since Machlup's testimony in 1958 has failed to fi nd 
evidence that patents promote the common good, it is surely time to reassess 
his conclusion that it would be irresponsible to abolish the patent system. The 
patent system arose as a way to limit the power of royalty to award monopolies to 
favored individuals; but now its primary effect is to encourage large but stagnant 
incumbent fi rms to block innovation and inhibit competition. </p>
