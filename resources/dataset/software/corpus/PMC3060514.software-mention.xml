ased yet also pathway-sensitive (19). Thus, we initially tested 
the standard straight-chain orthosteric FFA2/FFA3 agonists, 
formate (C1), acetate (C2), propionate (C3), butyrate (C4), and 
valerate (C5), using the Epic DMR assay and compared these 
results with those obtained with the traditional [ 35 S]GTPS 
binding assay, which measures predominantly G i/o G protein 
activation (and hence is appropriate for both FFA2 and FFA3 
signaling). In addition, second messenger accumulation in 
whole cells was examined using IP 1 assays for FFA2 and cAMP 
accumulation assays for FFA3. 
Stimulation of Flp-In T-REx 293 cells stably transfected to 
express human FFA2 on demand resulted in positive deflec-
tions in DMR in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), </p>

<p>the peaks of which can be converted into log concentration-
response curves to determine potency and efficacy for each 
agonist (Fig. 1C, red symbols, and Table 1). Notably, the DMR 
traces obtained for the same ligands at FFA2 (Fig. 1A) or FFA3 
(Fig. 1B) were qualitatively different, indicating the involve-
ment of non-identical signaling pathways and corroborating 
previous studies using traditional second messenger assays 
(6 -8, 18, 20). Millimolar activity of formate (C1) on FFA2 was 
confirmed (7), but no activity was observed on FFA3 at up to 10 
mM. In accordance with previous results, acetate (C2) was more 
than an order of magnitude more potent on FFA2, whereas 
propionate (C3) was the most potent SCFA and equipotent at 
each receptor (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Butyrate (C4) and valerate 
(C5) exhibited modest selectivity for FFA3 and in the case of 
valerate with lower efficacy than C3 also in agreement with 
other reports (6, 7). 
Examination of each of C1-C5 in traditional assays of recep-
tor activation resulted in a similar pattern of selectivity (Fig. 1, D 
and E, and Table 1), although as expected for signals with dif-
ferent levels of amplification and for comparisons between 
intact cells and cell membrane assays, absolute values of 
potency varied somewhat. Despite this, C1 and C2 had marked </p>

C1 and C2, respectively, where positive pEC 50 indicates selec-
tivity for FFA2 and a negative number represents FFA3 selec-
tivity). LEs were calculated using an average of the experimen-
tally determined pEC 50 values and indicate that C2 and C3 do 
indeed have LE values close to the maximal value (Table 1). 
Selection and Evaluation of Compounds-SCAs with lipo-
philic hydrocarbon tails consisting of four or fewer carbon 
atoms, including cyclic and unsaturated compounds with well 
defined three-dimensional structure, were selected to thor-
oughly explore the binding site of FFA2. We screened these 
SCAs at a single concentration of 300 M using the Epic DMR 
(Fig. 2). None of the noted chemicals produced significant 
DMR responses in native HEK 293 cells lacking expression of 
either FFA2 or FFA3 (Fig. 2A). A large proportion of the SCAs 
tested displayed activity, however, at either or both FFA2 (Fig. </p>

<p>2B) and FFA3 (Fig. 2C). SCAs with polar substituents, like 26 
and 27, or larger structures, like 28, were close to inactive on 
both receptors. Ligands that generated negative DMR signals 
were not pursued further, whereas the majority of the active 
compounds were then further explored with both full concen-
tration-response curves in the DMR assay and at [ 35 S]GTPS 
binding and appropriate second messenger pathways (Table 1 
and below) after being subdivided into groups based upon their 
structure to enable SAR investigation. 
Branched and Cyclic Compounds-Receptor selectivity and 
SAR were examined with branched and cyclic SCAs using the 
Epic DMR assay (Fig. 3A) and conventional signaling assays 
(Table 1 and Fig. 3B). Isobutyrate, isovalerate (2), and pivalate 
(3), representing bulkier methyl-substituted analogs of propio-
nate and butyrate, have previously been reported to be at least 
an order of magnitude more selective for FFA3 over FFA2 (7). </p>

<p>We also found these ligands to be selective for FFA3 over FFA2 
(pEC 50 0.4 for 2 and 0.7 for 3; Fig. 3, A and B, and 
Table 1), and this relationship extended to sec-valerate (4; 
pEC 50 0.7; Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, although selec-
tive for FFA3, both 2 and 4 were poorly efficacious at this recep-
tor in the DMR assay, an observation that was consistent at the 
other signaling assays for 4 but not 2. Cyclopropylcarboxylate 
(5), a somewhat bulkier analog of C3, exhibited moderate selectiv-
ity for FFA3, which was maintained upon replacing the cyclopro-
pyl with cyclobutyl (6). The bulky cyclopropyl analog (7) was equi-</p>

<p>potent with C3 on FFA3 and was 30-fold selective for FFA3 over 
FFA2. A similar selectivity was observed for the cyclopropyl analog 
8. In each instance these ligands displayed close to full agonism at 
FFA3 (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table 1). Based upon these findings, 
branched and cyclic SCAs appear to be selective for FFA3 over 
FFA2 at a variety of signaling readouts. 
Non-conjugated Unsaturated Compounds-Introduction of 
a terminal double bond in C4 (9) resulted in preserved FFA3 
activity and slightly increased selectivity over FFA2 compared 
with C4 (pEC 50 0.7; Fig. 3, A and B, and Table 1), whereas </p>

both receptors.

<p>nist at both FFA2 and FFA3 but was moderately selective for 
FFA2 (pEC 50 0.7; Fig. 4, A and B). Introduction of a triple 
bond with propargylate (14) resulted in a ligand markedly more 
selective for FFA2 (pEC 50 1.3; Fig. 4, A and B, and Table 1) 
with little to no activity observed in either the Epic DMR assay 
or second messenger assays for FFA3. For FFA2, methyl substi-
tutions were accommodated at all positions on acrylate (16-20) 
(Fig. 4, A and B, and Table 1). In contrast, FFA3 was far less 
tolerant to conjugated unsaturated compounds. Of the ligands 
tested, trans-3-methyl (16), cis-3-methyl (17), and 2-methyl 
(18) substitutions were moderately active with reduced efficacy 
and, for 17, reduced potency in both the DMR and signaling 
assays (pEC 50 0.6). The terminally dimethyl-substituted 19 
maintained the selectivity of 17, whereas 2,3-cis-dimethylacry-
late (20) and 2,3-trans-dimethylacrylate (21) both exhibited 
100-fold selectivity for FFA2 (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table 1). 
The conjugated cyclopentene analog 22 exhibited activity with 
low efficacy on FFA2 but again 100-fold selectivity over 
FFA3 (Table 1). Thus, the series of conjugated unsaturated 
SCAs preferentially activated the FFA2 receptor, and this was 
achieved without substantial loss of LE. 
General Rule for SCA Selectivity at FFA2 and FFA3 and 
Molecular Modeling of Binding Pocket-Close inspection of the 
SAR data described above led us to hypothesize a general rule </p>

<p>governing SCA selectivity at FFA2 and FFA3. Overall, we found 
that C1, C2, and all conjugated unsaturated carboxylic acids 
exhibited substantial selectivity for FFA2, whereas the remain-
ing compounds exhibited selectivity for FFA3. Thus, we pro-
pose that ligands with sp 2 -or sp-hybridized -carbon preferen-
tially activate FFA2, whereas FFA3-selective ligands contain a 
substituted sp 3 -hybridized -carbon. Furthermore, this rela-
tionship indicates that the binding pockets of FFA2 and FFA3 
must be subtly different despite both receptors requiring the 
same four basic amino acids for SCFA binding (18). 
To examine the molecular determinants of SCA ligand selec-
tivity, we docked the FFA2-selective compound 20 (Fig. 5A) 
and FFA3-selective compound 7 (Fig. 5B) into our molecular 
models of the receptors. Because 12 also showed receptor-spe-
cific effects, albeit on efficacy rather than potency in the 
[ 35 S]GTPS assay, we also modeled 12 at FFA3 (Fig. 5C). We 
have previously demonstrated that SCFA binding requires two 
conserved arginine residues in both FFA2 and FFA3, ArgV:05/ 
5.39 and ArgVII:08/7.35 (numbered according to the systems of 
Schwartz and Baldwin (25, 41, 42) and Ballesteros and Wein-
stein (26)), which are presumed to act as anchoring residues for 
the carboxylic acid on SCFAs (18). As expected, the carboxyl 
group of each of the ligands is coordinating these arginines 
in the models, and the ligands are placed in the cavity com-</p>

<p>prising transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6 (Fig. 5, A and B). In 
particular, the SCA is surrounded by Tyr 90 (III:09/3.33), 
Glu 166 (ECL2), Phe 168 (ECL2), Leu 183 (V:08/5.42), Cys 184 (V:09/ 
5.43), Tyr 238 (VI:16/6.51), and His 242 (VI:20/6.55) in hFFA2 and 
by Phe 96 (III:09/3.33), Leu 171 (ECL2), Phe 173 (ECL2), Met 188 (V: 
08/5.42), Ala 189 (V:09/5.43), Tyr 241 (VI:16/6.51), and His 245 (VI: 
20/6.55) in hFFA3. We noted that the non-conserved residues 
closest to the aliphatic moiety are residues at positions III:09/ 
3.33, V:08/5.42, and V:09/5.43 and Glu 166 /Leu 171 in ECL2. The 
aromatic residues at position III:09/3.33 form hydrophobic 
interactions with the ligand; the tyrosine OH group at this posi-
tion in FFA2 is predicted to interact with the carboxyl group of 
20. It is unlikely that this hydrogen-bond is crucial for binding, 
however, because the conserved positively charged arginines 
already anchor this group; thus, this residue is not thought to 
contribute to ligand selectivity. Of the remaining non-con-
served residues within the predicted binding pocket, amino 
acids at positions 5.42 and 5.43 are likely to provide hydropho-
bic interactions with the aliphatic moiety of the SCAs. 
Glu 166 (ECL2) of FFA2 forms a salt bridge with Arg 255 (VII:08/ 
7.35), thereby coordinating the position of Arg 255 , whereas 
Leu 171 (ECL2) of FFA3 has hydrophobic interactions with 
ligands 7 and 12 (Fig. 5C). Because our SAR data indicated that 
FFA3 preferred larger saturated or alicyclic moieties within the 
SCAs compared with FFA2, which preferred flat unsaturated 
moieties, we calculated the volume of the orthosteric binding 
sites. In accordance with our SAR studies, we found that the 
modeled binding site volume of FFA3 (105 Å 3 ) is more than 
double the volume of FFA2 (41 Å 3 ). This difference may be due 
to the presence of the non-conserved residues discussed earlier 
as well as different residue packing caused by overall sequence 
differences between the receptors. To verify that our models 
and, therefore, our binding pocket hypotheses were predictive, 
we next examined signaling at a series of orthosteric binding 
site mutants. 
Small Carboxylic Acids Bind to Orthosteric Binding Sites of 
FFA2 and FFA3-We have previously demonstrated that SCFA 
binding requires the two conserved arginine residues described 
above (18). To establish whether the selective SCAs are also 
accommodated within the orthosteric sites of FFA2 and FFA3, 
respectively, and to confirm positioning of ligands 20, 7, and 12 
in our molecular models, we examined the effect of these 
ligands in [ 35 S]GTPS binding assays following mutation of 
either ArgV:05/5.39 or ArgVII:08/7.35 in FFA2 and FFA3. 
Membranes were isolated from Flp-In T-REx 293 cells stably 
expressing hFFA2 R180A(V:05/5.39)-eYFP, hFFA2 R255A(VII: 
08/7.35)-eYFP, hFFA3 R185A(V:05/5.39)-eYFP, or hFFA3 
R258A(VII:08/7.35)-eYFP in an inducible manner (18). For 20, 
stimulation of wild type FFA2-eYFP but not hFFA2 R180A(V: 
05/5.39)-eYFP or hFFA2 R255A(VII:08/7.35)eYFP membranes 
resulted in [ 35 S]GTPS incorporation (pEC 50 4.17 0.09; 
Fig. 6A), whereas no activity was observed at any of the forms </p>

<p>of FFA3 (Fig. 6B). Both arginine residues were also required for 
activity of ligand 7 as mutation of either ArgV:05/5.39 or 
ArgVII:08/7.35 prevented signal transduction at both FFA3 
(pEC 50 3.74 0.08 for wild type; Fig. 6C) and also FFA2 
where it is a weak partial agonist (pEC 50 3.05 0.09 for wild 
type; Fig. 6D). Thus, it is clear that the carboxylic acid head 
groups of the SCAs described here are also coordinating with 
the positively charged arginines in the orthosteric binding site. 
Examination of SCA Binding Pocket at FFA2-To interrogate 
the putative mode of binding of FFA2-selective ligands, we 
replaced three non-conserved residues lining the FFA2 binding 
site with the corresponding residues in FFA3. By making such a 
triple mutant receptor, we aimed to change the architecture of 
the binding pocket to more closely resemble that of FFA3 and, if 
our hypotheses were correct, change the selectivity of ligands 
acting at this receptor. Thus, the FFA2 residues Glu 166 (ECL2), 
Leu 183 (V:08/5.42), and Cys 184 (V:09/5.43) were substituted by 
the corresponding FFA3 residues Leu, Met, and Ala, respec-
tively (hereafter referred to as "FFA2 triple") within the context 
of hFFA2-eYFP (Fig. 7, A and B). Compounds 7 and 12 were 
subsequently docked in the model of FFA2 triple, indicating 
that mutation of these residues was consistent with facilitating 
FFA3 ligand binding. We again calculated the volume of the 
ligand binding site (this time at FFA2 triple) and found that 
exchange of the FFA3 residues within FFA2 increased the vol-
ume of the orthosteric site (50 Å 3 ), favoring accommodation of 
the bulkier 7 (Fig. 7A) and 12 (Fig. 7B), which are now located 
deeper within the pocket. Thus, to examine whether the triple 
mutant could lead to reversal of ligand selectivity at FFA2, a 
stable inducible Flp-In T-REx 293 cell line was established. 
FFA2 triple expression was assessed using eYFP fluorescence as 
a surrogate parameter and found to be at a level similar to wild </p>

<p>type hFFA2-eYFP and not significantly different from wild type 
hFFA3-eYFP (Fig. 7C). 
As noted earlier, propionate is equipotent at FFA2 and FFA3 
in the [ 35 S]GTPS assay (Fig. 7D). Propionate potency at FFA2 
triple was identical to wild type FFA2 and FFA3 (Fig. 7D), indi-
cating that these modifications to the orthosteric binding site of 
FFA2 did not cause gross changes in receptor conformation. 
Consistent with the Epic DMR assay data in Fig. 4A, 20 was 
selective for FFA2 because it was inactive at FFA3 (Fig. 7E). 
Critically, however, activity of 20 at FFA2 triple was markedly 
impaired, suggesting that the binding pocket could no longer 
effectively accommodate or be activated by this sp 2 ligand (Fig. 
7E). Because of their differing effects on selectivity and efficacy 
in the [ 35 S]GTPS assay, we also examined both 7 and 12 at the 
FFA2 triple chimera. The highly selective and bulky compound 
7 displayed 100-fold selectivity for FFA3 over FFA2 (pEC 50 
3.76 0.26 at FFA3 and pEC 50 1.65 0.17 at FFA2; Fig. 7F). 
Mutation within the FFA2 orthosteric binding pocket was able 
to rescue 7 function at FFA2 as this ligand displayed equivalent 
potency at FFA2 triple and the FFA3 receptor (pEC 50 3.80 
0.12) (Fig. 7F), although full agonism was not achieved. Con-
versely, although ligand 12 was highly selective for FFA3 in the 
DMR and second messenger assays (Fig. 3 and Table 1), in the 
[ 35 S]GTPS assay, it was equipotent at the wild type receptors 
but differed in the magnitude of signal effect. Interestingly, this 
poor efficacy at FFA2 wild type was completely reversed at 
FFA2 triple with maximum activation even exceeding that of 
wild type FFA3 (Fig. 7G). Thus, guided by developing a chemi-
cal rule for predicting specific activation of SCFA receptors and 
in conjunction with molecular modeling and site-directed 
mutagenesis, we were able to transfer FFA3 selectivity to FFA2. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>SCFAs are the endogenous ligands for both of the closely 
related receptors FFA2 and FFA3, acting with similar potency 
for all but the very shortest chain length SCFAs, C1 and C2 (1). 
The physiological roles of the two receptors have largely been 
based on studies with knock-out mice. The expression of FFA2, 
however, was recently found to be reduced in FFA3 knock-out 
mice, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions from these 
studies (27). Limited endogenous ligand selectivity, the low 
potency of these ligands, and the absence of selective </p>

<p>orthosteric compounds are therefore currently major obstacles 
to the exploration of the physiological and pathological roles of 
these receptors both in vitro and in vivo (15). In the present 
study, we sought to address this issue by examining the molec-
ular determinants of ligand selectivity at FFA2. By screening a 
targeted library of SCAs at FFA2 and counterscreening at FFA3 
using the holistic Epic DMR biosensor assay, we discovered a 
series of ligands with selectivity for either receptor. SAR analysis of 
the screening hits in combination with molecular modeling and 
site-directed mutagenesis enabled formulation of a general chem-</p>

<p>ical rule to predict receptor preference of SCAs. Three amino acids 
were identified as critical for selective orthosteric activation of 
FFA2, and transfer of these residues to the binding pocket of FFA3 
was sufficient to confer FFA3 ligand selectivity to the FFA2 recep-
tor. Our findings therefore provide the first description of the 
determinants of selective orthosteric activation for FFA2. 
Propionate is the most potent SCFA at both FFA2 and FFA3 
and displays close to maximal LE for both these receptors; i.e. it 
is highly potent based on its size. Although increased potency 
requires larger ligands, here we demonstrate that development 
of small but selective ligands is indeed feasible. In fact, 20 and 
21 represent two notable examples as they are both selective 
and potent given their size. These two ligands are expected to 
be instrumental for the design of novel selective orthosteric 
FFA2 activators. A multifaceted program combining the vali-
dated molecular model of FFA2 described herein with frag-
ment-based drug discovery may facilitate the identification of 
ligands with enhanced potency either by "growing" the ligands 
stepwise or by linking the SCAs to fragments docked at acces-
sible positions within the receptor (13). In recent times, a series 
of receptors have been shown to be activated by endogenous 
small molecule ligands that are more traditionally considered as 
products of intermediary metabolism (28 -31). All of these 
ligands have modest potency at their target receptors, and the 
concepts elucidated and discussed here may have general value 
in the identification of selective and more potent orthosteric 
agonists. This is particularly relevant as the potential therapeu-
tic implications of many of these receptors, e.g. GPR109A, 
clearly define a need to develop potent and selective agonists 
rather than antagonists (32, 33). 
A well defined shape was a criterion for selection of screening 
compounds to facilitate SAR analysis and modeling. Apart from 
C5, they only have zero to two rotatable bonds (defined as the 
number of non-cyclic single bonds where rotation leads to a 
change in the position of non-hydrogen atoms relative to the 
remaining molecule; e.g. 14 has zero rotatable bonds). These 
ligands adopt a very limited number of possible conformations 
and are therefore ideally suited for modeling and docking stud-
ies at the FFA2 binding site. Indeed, evidence of the accuracy of 
our FFA2 model and SCA docking is provided by the fact that 
we were able to identify the anchoring arginines for the carbox-
ylic acid group in transmembrane domain V and transmem-
brane domain VII and transfer ligand selectivity between FFA2 
and FFA3 by exchanging just three key amino acids. Very few 
examples of such a transfer of ligand selectivity between GPCR 
binding sites have been described. A notable example is the 
transfer of the binding of AMD3100 from CXCR4 to CXCR3 
achieved by a double mutation and the presence of two essential 
aspartates conserved in both receptors (34). 
It is well known from a number of studies that receptor phar-
macology may vary depending on the cellular context and the 
signaling end point under investigation (35-38). The SCFA 
receptors examined herein are known to engage with G i/o 
family proteins (FFA3) or with both G i/o and G q/11 (FFA2). 
This implies that, at least for FFA2, ligands may be identified 
with preference for individual signaling pathways. To rule out 
the possibility that so-called biased ligands may escape detec-
tion when using a single functional end point assay, one can </p>

<p>either gather biological information by testing compounds in 
several parallel assays or rather use one of the novel, label-free 
assay technologies that capture whole cell responses in a man-
ner comparable with tissue bioassays (24, 39, 40). The latter 
may also have the advantage that ligand activity will reflect an 
integrated response of a living cell rather than a readout deter-
mined in isolation and underappreciative of intertwined signal-
ing networks that overlap in time and space. In our study, we 
took advantage of the Corning Epic biosensor, which translates 
receptor activation into real time optical traces in a pathway-
unbiased yet pathway-sensitive manner (19) and chose this 
method for primary screening. Hit confirmation was per-
formed with classical biochemical ([ 35 S]GTPS) or second 
messenger (cAMP and IP 1 ) assays as validation. The majority of 
hits identified using the holistic approach were also confirmed 
in the classical assays. However, we also noted the existence of 
compounds such as 10 with activity in the Epic but complete 
inactivity in [ 35 S]GTPS binding assays. Lack of [ 35 S]GTPS 
incorporation induced by 10 at FFA2 might be explained by its 
inability to engage G i/o signaling; however, inactivity at FFA3 
of 10 is hard to rationalize given that activity was also detected 
in parallel cAMP inhibition assays. Hence, it is possible that the 
receptor-proximal [ 35 S]GTPS binding assay is simply not sen-
sitive enough to identify activators with poor potency and effi-
cacy because this is likely to be linked closely to receptor occu-
pancy, whereas more distal signals, such as those measured in 
the DMR assay, often provide substantial amplification and 
receptor reserve (39). In contrast, 2 was hardly active in DMR 
assays on either receptor but appeared to be a high efficacy 
agonist in GTPS binding. As DMR is an integrated signal, the 
absence of positive DMR for 2 may reflect additional but oppos-
ing cellular events triggered by this compound. Overall, these 
data demonstrate the strength of combining traditional end 
point with novel holistic assays to unravel mechanistic differ-
ences of compounds that would remain unexplored when using 
either method in isolation. 
It is interesting that introduction of an alkene or alkyne con-
jugated with the carboxylic acid in the SCAs consistently 
reversed FFA receptor selectivity and that FFA2 was able to 
accommodate and respond to larger compounds provided that 
they contained this conjugated unsaturation. Acrylate (13) is 
the parent compound of most of these and has agonist activity 
comparable with C3 yet preferentially activates FFA2 over 
FFA3. All substituted acrylates (16-22) were FFA2 agonists and 
showed preference or in most cases significant selectivity for 
FFA2 over FFA3. These results indicate that the binding pocket 
of FFA2 has a narrow shape, and steric restrictions apply in the 
area around the -carbon atoms of the SCFAs. The preferred 
planar structure around the carboxylic acid due to conjugation 
is likely to be a significant factor in FFA2 selectivity. These 
observations have led to the identification of a general rule to 
predict FFA2 versus FFA3 selectivity of small (6 carbon 
atoms) carboxylic acids with lipophilic tails: compounds carry-
ing an sp 2 -or sp-hybridized -carbon will be FFA2-selective, 
whereas compounds carrying a substituted sp 3 -hybridized 
-carbon will be FFA3-selective. The rule has proven highly 
predictive, and we have yet to observe any exceptions. </p>

<p>In summary, the first series of molecular tools selectively 
activating FFA2 via the orthosteric binding site was provided, 
and many of these ligands showed close to optimal ligand effi-
ciencies. Hence, it is possible to achieve selective activation of 
FFA2 versus FFA3 with rather small ligands. Such ligands will 
undoubtedly be useful to further explore the mechanism of 
activation of FFA2 in more detail or its signaling characteristics 
in vitro even in cells coexpressing the related FFA3. Future 
studies are needed to unravel whether selectivity can be main-
tained within molecules that are gradually increased in size to 
also achieve a gain of potency that will be a prerequisite to 
explore the role of FFA2 in vivo. Nevertheless, our results pro-
vide, for the first time, a molecular explanation for selective 
orthosteric activation of FFA2 by highlighting previously 
unrecognized determinants of selectivity within the orthosteric 
binding site. </p>
