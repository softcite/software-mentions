<p>ABSTRACT : Potassium channels, the largest group of pore proteins, selectively regulate the flow of potassium (K + ) ions 
across cell membranes. The activity and expression of K + channels are critical for the maintenance of normal functions in ves-
sels and neurons, and for the regulation of cell differentiation and maturation. However, their role and expression in stem cells </p>

<p>have been poorly understood. In this study, we isolated perivascular stem cells (PVCs) from human umbilical cords and inves-
tigated the expression patterns of big-conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + (BK Ca ) and voltage-dependent K + (K v ) channels using 
the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We also examined the effect of high glucose (HG, 25 mM) on expression 
levels of BK Perivascular stem cells (PVCs), originating from mesen-</p>

<p>chymal stem cells (MSCs), have greater proliferation and </p>

<p>differentiation potentials compared to those of bone mar-</p>

<p>row-derived MSCs (Crisan et al., 2008). Among the PVC </p>

<p>sources, human umbilical cords (HUC) have some ad-</p>

<p>vantages over other tissues because they are easily acces-</p>

<p>sible as a clinical waste product and have low inherent </p>

<p>immunogenicity (Nagamura-Inoue et al., 2014). For these </p>

<p>reasons, HUCPVCs have drawn considerable interest as a </p>

<p>promising material for regenerative medicine. In recent </p>

<p>years, the therapeutic effects of HUCPVCs on various di-</p>

<p>seases have been reported. Tsang et al. (2013) showed that </p>

<p>HUCPVCs contributed to skeletal regeneration by generat-</p>

<p>ing a matrix and recruiting resident progenitors in a bone </p>

<p>defect model. HUCPVCs also contributed to the repair of </p>

<p>injured lung tissue as well as protected against neuro-</p>

<p>degenerative diseases through paracrine effects (Mon-</p>

<p>temurro et al., 2011; Appaix et al., 2014). Thus, the identi-</p>

<p>fication and functional assessment of internal and external </p>

<p>factors regulating PVC functions are critical for improving </p>

<p>their therapeutic potential. </p>

<p>Potassium channels, the largest group of pore proteins, </p>

<p>are widely distributed in various cell types (Day et al., </p>

<p>1993; Park et al., 2007). They selectively regulate the flow </p>

<p>E Kim, WS Park, S-H Hong </p>



<p>of potassium (K + ) ions across cell membranes (Day et al., </p>

<p>1993). K + channels have important roles in maintaining </p>

<p>normal functions and physiological homeostasis in various </p>

<p>cell types as well as regulating the cell cycle, differentia-</p>

<p>tion, and maturation (Kawano et al., 2002). Although se-</p>

<p>veral studies have characterized the electrophysiological </p>

<p>properties of MSCs and pluripotent stem cells (Heubach et </p>

<p>al., 2003; Li et al., 2005; Wang et al. 2005; Bai et al., 2007; </p>

<p>Park et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2010; Park et al., 2013; Tara-</p>

<p>sov et al., 2017), the expression and function of ion chan-</p>

<p>nels in HUCPVCs have not been studied. Therefore, for </p>

<p>therapeutic applications, we need to investigate not only </p>

<p>the multi-lineage differentiation capacity, but also the elec-</p>

<p>trophysiological properties of K + channels in HUCPVCs. </p>

<p>In the present study, we investigated the expression pa-</p>

<p>tterns of big-conductance Ca 2+ -activated (BK Ca ) and vol-</p>

<p>tage-dependent K + (K v ) channels in undifferentiated HUC-</p>

<p>PVCs and examined the effects of high glucose (HG, 25 </p>

<p>mM) on the expression levels of BK Ca and K v channels. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>1. Cell isolation and culture </p>

<p>HUC tissues (n = 3) were obtained from mothers under-</p>

<p>going Caesarian sections, with written informed consent </p>

<p>after approval by the Institutional Review Board of </p>

<p>Kangwon National University Hospital. The isolation and </p>

<p>culturing of HUCPVCs were performed as described pre-</p>

<p>viously (An et al., 2015a). Briefly, HUCs were rinsed with </p>

<p>sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) </p>

<p>and incised along their length in dishes. Both ends of the </p>

<p>isolated vessels were ligated with black silk and then trans-</p>

<p>ferred into 100 mm culture dishes containing α-minimal </p>

<p>essential media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bo-</p>

<p>vine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 1% penicillin-streptomycin </p>

<p>(Sigma-Aldrich) and amphotericin B (0.3 µg/mL; Sigma-</p>

<p>Aldrich). After 7-10 days, the vessels were removed from </p>

<p>the dishes and the colonies were subcultured. Once the </p>

<p>cells reached 80% confluency, they were passaged by </p>

<p>treatment with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). To </p>

<p>evaluate the effect of high glucose on the expression of ion </p>

<p>channels in PVCs, the cells were plated at a density of </p>

<p>4×10 5 cells in 35 mm dishes and cultured in α-MEM me-</p>

<p>dium supplemented with low glucose (LG) (1.0 g/L, 5 mM) </p>

<p>and HG (4.5 g/L, 25 mM) for 5 days. </p>

<p>2. Flow cytometry analysis </p>

<p>HUCPVCs were dissociated into single cells using tryp-</p>

<p>sin-EDTA and resuspended in 1% FBS-PBS. The cells </p>

<p>were filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer and reacted </p>

<p>with the following antibodies conjugated with fluoro-</p>

<p>chrome for 1 hr at 4℃: CD31-phycoerythrin (PE), CD34-</p>

<p>fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC), CD45-allophycoeryth-</p>

<p>rin (APC), CD44-APC, CD90-APC, CD146-FITC, and </p>

<p>SSEA-4-FITC (all, BD Biosciences). The dead cells were </p>

<p>excluded with 7-aminoactinomycin D. Stained cells were </p>

<p>analyzed using the FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and </p>

<p>data were analyzed by <rs type="software">FlowJo</rs> software (FlowJo). </p>

<p>3. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </p>

<p>(RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR analysis </p>

<p>Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qi-</p>

<p>agen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, </p>

<p>total RNA was reverse transcribed by using the TOP-</p>

<p>script ™ RT DryMIX kit (#RT200; Enzynomics). Trans-</p>

<p>cripts were quantitated using TOPreal ™ qPCR 2X PreMIX </p>

<p>(#RT501S; Enzynomics) and the ABI StepOnePlus ™ Sys-</p>

<p>tem Instrument (Applied Biosystems). The expression lev-</p>

<p>els of BK Ca and K v channel genes were normalized to </p>

<p>glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and </p>

<p>the relative quantification was performed using the com-</p>

<p>parative CT method according to the manufacturer's in-</p>

<p>structions (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences are </p>

<p>listed in Table 1. </p>

<p>4. Data analysis </p>

<p>All results were expressed as mean±standard error of </p>

<p>mean (SEM). Student's t-test was used to determine statis-</p>

<p>tical significance. We considered *p&lt;0.05 to be statistical-</p>

<p>ly significant. </p>

<p>We obtained PVCs from the vessels of HUC tissues us-</p>

<p>ing a non-enzymatic (NE) isolation method (An et al., </p>

<p>2015b). To prevent cross contamination with hemato-</p>

<p>poietic and endothelial cells, both ends of the vessel were </p>

<p>ligated and then plated into dishes. On days 7-10 post-</p>

<p>plating, PVC colonies were subcutured and successfully </p>

<p>expanded. HUCPVCs exhibited fibroblast or spindle-like </p>

<p>morphology (Fig. 1A). The phenotypic expression of </p>

<p>HUCPVCs (Passage 2) was analyzed by flow cytometry. </p>

<p>The cells were positive for CD146 (93%), SSEA-4 (10.1 </p>

<p>%), CD44 (99.9 %), and CD90 (99%), and negative for </p>

<p>CD31, CD45, and CD34, which precluded contamination </p>

<p>by endothelial and hematopoietic cells (Fig. 1B). These </p>

<p>results suggested that the NE method enabled us to obtain </p>

<p>a homogenous PVC population and that the expression </p>

<p>pattern of surface markers on HUCPVCs was in agreement </p>

<p>with that of human PVCs reported in previous studies. </p>

<p>2. High glucose treatment alters the expression of </p>

<p>BK Ca and Kv channels in undifferentiated HUCPVCs </p>

<p>We first investigated the expression patterns of BK Ca </p>

<p>and K v channel subtypes in undifferentiated HUCPVCs. </p>

<p>We found comparable mRNA expression of K Ca β 3a and </p>

<p>K v 1.3 subtypes in undifferentiated HUCPVCs (Fig. 2A and </p>

<p>2B). The expression levels of BK Ca 1.1, BK Ca 2.2, K Ca β, </p>

<p>K v 3.3, and K v 6.1 subtypes were relatively low (Fig. 2A </p>

<p>Fig. 1. Isolation and characterization of HUCPVCs. (A) Non-enzymatic isolation of HUCPVCs. Both ends of the dis-
sected vessel were ligated and plated into a 100 mm dish. Perivascular stem cell (PVC) colonies were collected

flow cytometry. PVC marker, CD146; MSC markers, CD44 and CD90; endothelial and hematopoietic markers,

<p>and 2B). High concentrations of glucose in the blood af-</p>

<p>fected the growth and functions of endogenous stem cells. </p>

<p>Thus, we next asked if high glucose influenced the expres-</p>

<p>sion levels of ion channels. HUCPVCs were plated at a </p>

<p>density of 4×10 5 cells in 35 mm dishes and cultured in </p>

<p>both LG and HG conditions for 5 days. HG did not induce </p>

<p>subtypes in HUCPVCs cultured with LG and HG measured by RT-PCR. The expression levels of K v 1.3, K v 1.6,

<p>morphological changes in HUCPVCs (Fig. 2C), but re-</p>

<p>duced the proliferative activity (data not shown). HG-</p>

<p>treated HUCPVCs showed increased mRNA levels of </p>

<p>BK Ca β 3a , BK Ca β 4 , K v 1.3, K v 1.6, and K v 6.1 subtypes. We </p>

<p>confirmed the upregulation of BK Ca β 4 , K v 1.6, and K v 6.1 </p>

<p>transcripts in HUCPVCs exposed to HG using quantitative </p>

<p>real-time PCR (Fig. 3). These results suggested that BK Ca </p>

<p>and K v channels may have unique functions in the growth </p>

<p>and differentiation of HUCPVCs, which could be affected </p>

<p>by HG exposure. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>In the present study, we showed for the first time the ex-</p>

<p>pression patterns of BK Ca and K v ion channels in HUC-</p>

<p>PVCs, which could be altered by exposure to HG. In re-</p>

<p>cent years, PVCs have been suggested as a promising </p>

<p>source for cell-based therapy due to their greater regenera-</p>

<p>tive potential (Crisan et al., 2008). Ion channels are detect-</p>

<p>ed in a variety of cell types and play fundamental roles in </p>

<p>controlling cell proliferation and differentiation as well as </p>

<p>maintaining homeostasis (Kawano et al., 2002). Therefore, </p>

<p>we investigated the electrophysiological properties of HU-</p>

<p>CPVCs to improve their proliferative and regenerative </p>

<p>capacities. </p>

<p>Recent studies reported the electrophysiological proper-</p>

<p>ties of multipotent MSCs and found that the expression </p>

<p>patterns of ion channels were relatively heterogeneous </p>

<p>among MSCs. While similar expression levels of Kv1.4, </p>

<p>Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 subtypes were observed between </p>

<p>adipose tissues (AD)-and bone marrow (BM)-derived </p>

<p>MSCs, expression of Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and Kv7.3 subtypes </p>

<p>varied across the tissues or among studies (Heubach et al., </p>

<p>2003; Li et al., 2005; Bai et al., 2007; Park et al., 2007; </p>

<p>Park et al., 2013). Bai et al. (2007) could not detect Kv4.1 </p>

<p>subtype in AD-MSCs. However, Park et al. (2013) report-</p>

<p>ed strong expression of Kv4.1 subtype in AD-MSCs. The </p>

<p>heterogeneity of Kv ion channels in MSCs may be at-</p>

<p>tributed to variations among donors or the tissues from </p>

<p>which MSCs are isolated. Our data showed different ex-</p>

<p>pression patterns of ion channel subtypes in PVCs com-</p>

<p>pared with AD-and BM-MSCs, indicating that PVCs are </p>

<p>different subpopulations and are more homogeneous than </p>

<p>MSCs. Culture conditions might also influence the expres-</p>

<p>sion of specific ion channel subtypes detected in MSCs. </p>

<p>For example, BM-MSCs cultured in HG medium exhibited </p>

<p>senescence and genetic instability by upregulation of au-</p>

<p>tophagy and oxidative stress (Chang et al., 2015). In addi-</p>

<p>tion, hyperglycemia impaired the proliferation and func-</p>

<p>tion of endogenous stem and somatic cells such as MSCs, </p>

<p>hematopoietic stem cells and Müller cells (Kim et al., 2015; </p>

<p>Kocabas et al., 2015; Manea et al., 2015; Hadarits et al., </p>

<p>2016; Qiu et al., 2016). Thus, we assumed that the glucose </p>

<p>concentration in the culture medium may affect the expres-</p>

confirmation of upregulated subtypes in HG-treated HUCPVCs. Error bars indicate SEM. *p&lt;0.05. Other abbre-</p>

<p>sion levels of ion channels in PVCs and found increased </p>

<p>levels of BK Ca β 3a , BK Ca β 4 , K v 1.3, K v 1.6, and K v 6.1 trans-</p>

<p>cripts in HG-treated PVCs compared to those of LG-</p>

<p>treated PVCs. </p>

<p>In summary, this is the first characterization of ion </p>

<p>channels in HUCPVCs, which provides fundamental in-</p>

<p>formation to improve the regenerative capacity of HUC-</p>

<p>PVCs. Further study will be needed to define the physio-</p>

<p>logical roles of specific ion channels in the proliferation </p>

<p>and differentiation of HUCPVCs. </p>
