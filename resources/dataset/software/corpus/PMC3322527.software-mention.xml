<p>Development of the palate comprises sequential stages of growth, elevation, and fusion 
of the palatal shelves. The mesenchymal component of palates plays a major role in 
early phases of palatogenesis, such as growth and elevation. Failure in these steps may 
result in cleft palate, the second most common birth defect in the world. These early 
stages of palatogenesis require precise and chronological orchestration of key physiologi-
cal processes, such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis.There 
is compelling evidence for the vital role ofTGFβ-mediated regulation of palate development. 
We hypothesized that the isoforms of TGFβ regulate different cellular biofunctions of the 
palatal mesenchyme to various extents. Human embryonic palatal mesenchyme (HEPM) 
cells were treated with TGFβ1, β2, and β3 for microarray-based gene expression studies in 
order to identify the roles of TGFβ in the transcriptome of the palatal mesenchyme. Follow-
ing normalization and modeling of 28,869 human genes, 566 transcripts were detected as 
differentially expressed in TGFβ-treated HEPM cells. Out of these altered transcripts, 234 
of them were clustered in cellular biofunctions, including growth and proliferation, devel-
opment, morphology, movement, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Biological interpretation and 
network analysis of the genes active in cellular biofunctions were performed using <rs type="software">IPA</rs>. 
Among the differentially expressed genes, 11 of them are known to be crucial for palatoge-
nesis (EDN1, INHBA, LHX8, PDGFC, PIGA, RUNX1, SNAI1, SMAD3, TGF β1, TGF β2, and 
TGF βR1).These genes were used for a merged interaction network with cellular behaviors. 
Overall, we have determined that more than 2% of human transcripts were differentially 
expressed in response to TGFβ treatment in HEPM cells. Our results suggest that both 
TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 orchestrate major cellular biofunctions within the palatal mesenchyme 
in vitro by regulating expression of 234 genes. </p>

<p>TGFβ-treated HEPM transcriptome </p>

<p>Fifty genes function in cell morphology; 12 were downregulated 
and 38 were upregulated. Cellular development included 91 genes, 
among which 53 were upregulated and 38 were downregulated. </p>

<p>FIGURE 2 | Expression levels of the most significantly up-and 
downregulated genes based on microarray and qPCR analyses. The 
graphical representation of genes (n = 27) displaying the most significant 
changes in expression patterns in response to TGFβ stimulation with their 
FC values based on microarray analyses were shown (A). Only TGFβ1 and 
TGFβ2 treatments were represented in (A) due to their statistically 
significant p-values detected by <rs type="software">dChip</rs>. (B,C) Gene expression profiles of all 
27 genes were independently validated using qPCR and data was analyzed 
using <rs id="software-24" type="software">REST</rs> <rs corresp="#software-24" type="version">2009</rs> (Pfaffl et al., 2002). Expression variation for each gene 
was visualized in a whisker-box plot. Transcripts were sorted alphabetically. </p>

<p>The Cell cycle GO was represented by 37 genes; 20 were upregulated 
and 17 were downregulated. The GO cluster containing the high-
est number of differentially expressed genes (n = 93) compared 
to other cellular biofunction clusters was the cellular growth and 
proliferation GO, including 57 upregulated and 36 downregulated 
transcripts. 
A representation of the network-based interactions of the dif-
ferentially expressed genes, according to their cellular biofunc-
tions, and their molecule type, is shown in Figure 5. Due to 
the high number of genes in each biofunction, we preferred 
the genes with an FC &gt;2.0 for network interactions. In the cell 
cycle network, only three genes (SMAD3, let-7, and EPGN ) were 
downregulated, and seven genes (mir-199, IGFBP3, SKIL, NOX4, 
IVNS1ABP, EDN1, and NEDD9) were upregulated. Within the cel-
lular movement network there were 4 significantly downregulated 
genes (SMAD3, SERPINB2, GDF5, and NPTX1) and 15 upregu-
lated genes (ADAM19, VDR, VLDLR, NUAK1, NEDD9, LRRC15,  mir-199, IGFBP3, EDN1, MAP2, ADAM12, LTBP2, IVNS1ABP,  NOX4, and ITGB3) in response to TGFβ treatment. In the net-
work of cellular growth and proliferation, we detected 8 genes 
(TRA2A, EPGN, GDF5, SERPINB2, SMAD3, let-7, GPAM, and 
mir-218) which were downregulated, while 17 genes (KCNH1, 
ITGB3, PMEPA1, NOX4, IVNS1ABP, VLDLR, IGFBP3, ADAM12, 
EDN1, AK4, VDR, ANKRD1, TGFβI, NEDD9, SKIL, TNFAIP6, and 
SPOCK1) were upregulated. Downregulated genes belonging to 
the cell morphology GO network include NPTX1 and SMAD3; and 
upregulated genes (n = 11) include LTBP2, VDR, ASPN, TGFβI, 
IGFBP3, EDN1, MAP2, VLDLR, NEDD9, NOX4, and ITGB3. In 
the cellular development network, 6 genes (mir-218, TRA2A, GDF5, 
SERPINB2, SMAD3, and let-7 ) were downregulated and 12 genes 
(EDN1, PMEPA1, SKIL, VDR, ASPN, IVNS1ABP, TGFβI, VLDLR, 
NOX4, IGFBP3, ITGB3, and KCHN1) were upregulated. Within the 
cell death (apoptosis) GO network, 5 genes (NPTX1, GDF5, SER-
PINB2, SMAD3, and GPAM ) were downregulated and 14 genes 
(NUAK1, SKIL, VDR, AMIGO2, ANKRD1, TGFβI, ADAM12, mir- 199, IVNS1ABP, IGFBP3, NEDD9, NOX4, EDN1, PMEPA1, and  ITGB3) were upregulated. </p>
