<p>OBJECTIVE-To determine the role of glucagon action in the 
metabolic phenotype of untreated insulin deficiency. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We compared perti-
nent clinical and metabolic parameters in glucagon receptor-null 
(Gcgr 2/2 ) mice and wild-type (Gcgr +/+ ) controls after equivalent 
destruction of b-cells. We used a double dose of streptozotocin to 
maximize b-cell destruction. </p>

<p>RESULTS-Gcgr +/+ mice became hyperglycemic (.500 mg/dL), 
hyperketonemic, polyuric, and cachectic and had to be killed after 
6 weeks. Despite comparable b-cell destruction in Gcgr 2/2 mice, 
none of the foregoing clinical or laboratory manifestations of di-
abetes appeared. There was marked a-cell hyperplasia and hyper-
glucagonemia (;1,200 pg/mL), but hepatic phosphorylated cAMP 
response element binding protein and phosphoenolpyruvate car-
boxykinase mRNA were profoundly reduced compared with 
Gcgr +/+ mice with diabetes-evidence that glucagon action had 
been effectively blocked. Fasting glucose levels and oral and in-
traperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were normal. Both fasting 
and nonfasting free fatty acid levels and nonfasting b-hydroxy 
butyrate levels were lower. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS-We conclude that blocking glucagon action 
prevents the deadly metabolic and clinical derangements of type 
1 diabetic mice. Diabetes 60:391-397, 2011 </p>

<p>(Gcgr +/+ ) mice, Gcgr 2/2 remained free of all manifestations 
of insulin deficiency. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS </p>

<p>Male mice with global glucagon receptor knockout and wild-type mice (19) 
were provided by M.J.C. They were housed in individual cages with constant 
temperature and 12 h of light alternating with 12 h of darkness and fed Teklad 
6% mouse/rat diet (Teklad, Madison, WI) with free access to water. The pro-
tocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory 
Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the North Texas Veterans 
Administration Medical Center. 
Chemical destruction of b-cells. b-cells were destroyed in 10-to 12-week-old 
Gcgr 2/2 and Gcgr +/+ mice with two intravenous injections of STZ (100 mg/kg 
body weight followed in 7 days by 80 mg/kg). Food intake, body weight, and 
blood glucose were measured weekly for 6 weeks. 
Plasma measurements. Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucose 
meter (Bayer Healthcare, Mishawka, IN). Plasma glucagon levels were mea-
sured using a Linco glucagon RIA kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma 
insulin levels were measured using a rat/mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal 
Chem, Downers Grove, IL), and IGF-1 levels were measured using an IGF-1 
ELISA kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd., Boldon, UK). Free fatty acids 
(FFAs) were measured with a nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) kit (Waco Pure 
Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). 
Oral glucose tolerance test. After a 16 h fast, glucose (2 g/kg) was admin-
istered by gavage to the Gcgr mice. Blood was taken at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 
120 min intervals, and the blood glucose and plasma insulin were analyzed. 
Immunoblotting. Livers were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) 
buffer (0.15mM NaCl/0.05mM TrisHCl, pH,7.2/1% Triton-X100/1% sodium 
deoxycholate/0.1% SDS) with 10 mg/mL leupeptin and 10 mg/mL aprotinin. 
Proteins were resolved by sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/ 
PAGE) and transferred to a membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). 
The blotted membrane was blocked in 1 3 Tris-buffered saline (TBS) con-
taining 0.1% tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room tem-
perature. After incubation with primary antibodies to cAMP-responsive 
element binding (CREB) and phospho-CREB (P-CREB) (1:1000; Cell Signaling 
Technology, Danvers, MA) or anti-g-tubulin at 4°C overnight, the membrane 
was washed with TBST buffer. Membranes were incubated with goat anti-
rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG for 1 h. The 
proteins were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence detection system 
(GE Healthcare). 
Real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the liver by 
Trizol isolation method (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). All PCR reactions 
were performed in triplicate as previously described (25). The mRNA level was 
calculated by using standard curve method. Primer sequences are shown in 
Supplementary Table 1. 
Amino acid analysis of livers. Amino acids were analyzed in liver homoge-
nates by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). All MS analyses used stable-isotope 
dilution with internal standards from Isotec, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, and 
CDN Isotopes. 
Immunohistochemistry and b-cell mass measurement. The distal 20% of 
pancreata dissected from adult mice were fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma, St. 
Louis, MO) and dehydrated prior to paraffin embedding. Five micrometer 
contiguous paraffin sections were prepared on a Leica RM2155 rotary mi-
crotome for insulin and glucagon immunohistochemical staining, as previously 
described (26). Morphometric analysis for insulin cells was performed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Image-J</rs> image analysis software and particle analysis macro (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Scion</rs>, 
Frederick, MD). The area of insulin staining in three sections of pancreas from 
4-6 animals, relative to total sectional area examined, was quantified by 
monochromatic thresholding. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis. Results are reported as means 6 SEM. Statistical anal-
ysis of the data was performed with Student t test. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Assessing completeness of b-cell destruction by STZ. 
Conarello et al. (24) reported that Gcgr 2/2 mice are re-
sistant to the b-cytotoxic action of STZ and without com-
plete destruction of b-cells, it would be impossible to 
evaluate the benefits of glucagon blockade in total insulin 
deficiency states. Because increased b-cell survival in 
Gcgr 2/2 mice could explain the lack of hyperglycemia in 
response to a b-cytotoxin, we administered a double dose, 
100 mg/kg of body weight of STZ, followed 7 days later 
with an 80 mg/kg dose. We quantified the surviving b-cells 
with STZ-treated Gcgr +/+ mice by immunostaining for in-
sulin and glucagon. Morphometry of immunocytochemi-
cally stained insulin-positive cells revealed 90% b-cell 
destruction in sections of pancreata from Gcgr 2/2 mice, 
not significantly different from the 94% destruction Gcgr +/+ 
mice (Table 1). After STZ treatment, a-cell area of Gcgr +/+ 
mice increased 10-fold. The a-cell area of Gcgr 2/2 mice 
before STZ was almost 7-fold greater than that of un-
treated Gcgr +/+ mice and after STZ it was 39-fold greater 
(Table 1). Plasma insulin levels were reduced by 90% after 
STZ in both groups (Table 1). Finally, the most sensitive 
and specific indicator of b-cell activity, pancreatic pre-
proinsulin mRNA, was below the detectable range of 
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in both Gcgr +/+ and 
Gcgr /-mice treated with STZ (Table 1). These findings in-
dicate that the STZ-resistance of b-cells of Gcgr 2/2 mice 
could be overcome by doubling the dose of the b-cytotoxin. 
This made it possible to determine the role of diabetic 
hyperglucagonemia on the phenotype of complete insulin 
deficiency. 
Completeness of glucagon inactivation. A second 
prerequisite of the study was that glucagon be completely 
inactivated. Plasma glucagon levels in Gcgr 2/2 mice were 
;14-fold higher than in Gcgr +/+ mice prior to STZ treat-
ment, confirming the report of Gelling et al. (19), and 
;16-fold higher after STZ treatment (Fig. 1A and B). To 
assess the completeness of glucagon inactivation in the 
Gcgr 2/2 mice, we compared the hepatic levels of P-CREB 
(27), a key protein in its signal transduction pathway, with 
those of wild-type controls. Given the marked hyper-
glucagonemia, hepatic P-CREB should be increased if any 
functionally intact glucagon receptor was present in liver. 
However, P-CREB could not be detected in livers of STZ-
diabetic Gcgr 2/2 mice (Fig. 1C). Total CREB protein was 
also reduced. These results are consistent with those pre-
viously reported by Gelling et al. (19) that confirm a com-
plete blockade of glucagon action in the liver of Gcgr 2/2 
mice. </p>

<p>Comparison of clinical parameters. The lethal pheno-
type that developed rapidly in Gcgr +/+ mice after the large 
dose of STZ did not appear in Gcgr 2/2 mice treated with 
the same STZ dose. Food intake rose in the Gcgr +/+ di-
abetic mice from 4.5 g/d before the diabetes to 9.3 g/d after 
STZ treatment but increased by only 3.0 g/d in the Gcgr 2/2 
mice (Fig. 2A). The severe polyuria and polydipsia of 
the Gcgr +/+ mice did not occur in the STZ-treated Gcgr 2/2 
mice (data not shown). The diabetic wild-type mice became 
progressively sicker and had to be killed, whereas the 
Gcgr 2/2 mice seemed to remain in their normal state of 
health throughout the 6-week study despite the lack of 
insulin and were apparently healthy when finally killed at 
12 weeks after STZ. 
Body weight of the mice before and 6 weeks after STZ 
treatment appears in Fig. 2B. 
Comparison of glucoregulatory parameters. All Gcgr +/+ 
mice became severely hyperglycemic after treatment 
with STZ, their fed and fasting blood glucose levels 
approaching 500 mg/dL within a week after administration 
of the STZ and increasing slightly thereafter. By contrast, 
in the Gcgr 2/2 mice fed and fasting glucose levels after 
STZ-treatment remained in a perfectly normal range 
throughout the 6-week study and for at least 6 weeks 
thereafter (Fig. 2C). </p>

<p>The ablation of glucagon action was expected to prevent 
fasting hyperglycemia by reducing hepatic glucose pro-
duction but was not expected to improve the glucose tol-
erance test, which is generally considered to be, in large 
part, an index of insulin-mediated glucose disposal. Sur-
prisingly, comparison of oral glucose tolerance of Gcgr 2/2 
mice with and without STZ-induced destruction of b-cells 
revealed normal curves in both groups. In other words, the 
presence or absence of b-cells had no apparent effect on 
the glucose curves of the Gcgr 2/2 mice, all of which were 
well within normal limits (Fig. 2D). To exclude a differ-
ence in glucose absorption in the STZ-treated mice, we 
performed intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests in 
Gcgr 2/2 mice with and without intact b-cells. Again, glu-
cose tolerance was normal in both groups (data not shown). 
To determine if these unexpected results could be 
explained by an increase in insulin from a few surviving 
b-cells in the STZ-treated Gcgr 2/2 mice, we compared in-
sulin levels in the two groups. The STZ-treated Gcgr 2/2 
mice exhibited no increase in insulin levels above the basal 
value, whereas the insulin response of untreated knockout 
mice rose to over 1.2 ng/mL-about the same as in normal 
Gcgr +/+ mice (Fig. 2E). Thus, insulin was not involved in 
the normal glucose tolerance curves of Gcgr 2/2 mice. 
IGF-1. To determine if an insulin-like growth factor might 
have normalized glucose tolerance in the absence of in-
sulin, we measured fasting and postprandial IGF-1 levels. 
In Gcgr 2/2 mice, fasting (65 6 27 vs. 256 6 48 ng/mL) and 
nonfasting (130 6 20 vs. 303 6 23 ng/mL) IGF-1 levels were 
significantly below those of Gcgr +/+ controls (P , 0.001). After 
STZ treatment, in Gcgr +/+ mice fasting IGF-1 levels varied 
widely, averaging 284 6 90 vs. 140 6 10 ng/mL (not signifi-
cant) in Gcgr 2/2 mice. Nonfasting IGF-1 levels, which could 
not be detected in Gcgr +/+ mice after STZ treatment, av-
eraged 109 6 17 ng/mL in STZ-treated Gcgr 2/2 mice. We 
concluded that IGF-1 could not be the cause of the normal 
glucose tolerance observed in the absence of both insulin 
and glucagon action. 
Comparison of FFAs and ketones. Fasting and FFA 
levels were significantly higher in normal Gcgr 2/2 mice 
and Gcgr +/+ controls. They were not suppressed by food in 
either group (Fig. 3A). But both fasting and nonfasting 
levels were significantly lower in STZ-treated Gcgr 2/2 
mice than in Gcgr +/+ controls, consistent with a lipolytic 
role for glucagon when insulin is very low. The plasma 
b-hydroxybutyrate levels of Gcgr 2/2 mice were signifi-
cantly below the elevated levels of STZ-treated Gcgr +/+ 
controls (P , 0.001) (Fig. 3B), evidence that glucagon 
action is required for ketogenesis, as proposed by Meier 
et al. (28). 
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA and 
lactate levels in insulin-deficient Gcgr +/+ and Gcgr 2/2 
mice. Uncontrolled insulin deficiency with hypergluca-
gonemia is characterized by increased gluconeogenesis as-
sociated with upregulation of the gluconeogenic enzyme, 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (29,30). The 
expression of this enzyme was therefore compared in Gcgr +/+ 
and Gcgr 2/2 mice treated with STZ. Figure 4A shows the 
expected increase in PEPCK mRNA in STZ-induced insulin 
deficiency of Gcgr +/+ mice. It was substantially reduced in 
Gcgr 2/2 mice with STZ-induced insulin deficiency. This re-
duction was associated with a significant increase in lactate, 
a gluconeogenic precursor (Fig. 4B).

plasma amino acids through increased urinary excretion 
and that somatostatin-induced hypoglucagonemia has the 
opposite effect. This prompted a metabolomic analysis of 
amino acid profiles in the liver of both normal and insulin-
deficient Gcgr +/+ and Gcgr 2/2 mice (Table 2). Of the 16 
amino acids measured, 9 were significantly (P , 0.01) in-
creased in normal Gcgr 2/2 mice, but only 1 was elevated 
in the STZ-treated insulin-deficient Gcgr 2/2 mice. This 
suggests that in the presence of normal insulin action, 
glucagon action is required to prevent hepatic over-
accumulation of amino acids. When insulin is absent, 
however, amino acid levels are relatively normal despite 
lack of glucagon action. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to assess the role of the 
hyperglucagonemia of total insulin deficiency in the lethal 
catabolic consequences of the disease and to determine if 
beneficial effects of glucagon blockade are sufficient and 
safe enough to qualify as a potential therapeutic target in 
human type 1 diabetes. This idea was proposed previously </p>

<p>(9,10) when somatostatin, the first glucagon-suppressing 
agent to be discovered (6), was found to prevent the acute 
metabolic consequences of complete insulin lack (7,8). 
The search for more practical suppressors or antagonists of 
glucagon has been reenergized by the recent demonstration 
that leptin can suppress diabetic hyperglucagonemia and 
reverse the catabolic effects of complete insulin deficiency 
for extended periods without apparent negative conse-
quences (11,12). 
Although leptin is very effective in suppressing the 
hyperglucagonemia and in reversing the metabolic mani-
festations of type 1 diabetes (11,12), the many other 
actions of the adipocyte hormone make it impossible to 
assume that suppression of glucagon by itself accounts for 
the remarkable remission of all clinical and laboratory 
manifestations of total insulin deficiency. The Gcgr 2/2 
mice of Gelling et al. (24) provided an ideal model in which 
to assess the immediate and longer-term benefits and risks 
of permanent elimination of glucagon action without other 
actions of leptin unrelated to a-cell suppression, such as 
food restriction and lipopenia. We were able to overcome 
the previously reported resistance of Gcgr 2/2 mice to STZ </p>

<p>destruction of b-cells by using higher doses of STZ (24). 
The b-cell destruction was as complete as in Gcgr +/+ con-
trols, as evidenced by insulin assays of plasma, morpho-
metric comparison of pancreata for insulin-positive cells, 
and qRT-PCR measurements of pancreatic preproinsulin 
mRNA. This enabled an assessment of the effects of com-
plete elimination of glucagon action on the phenotype of 
mice with total insulin deficiency. 
Whereas all STZ-treated Gcgr +/+ diabetic mice de-
veloped severe hyperglycemia, ketosis, and cachexia and 
had to be killed for humane reasons ;30 days after in-
duction of diabetes, none of the insulin-deficient Gcgr 2/2 
mice developed any laboratory or clinical evidence of in-
sulin deficiency. Without exception, all STZ-treated Gcgr 2/2 
mice appeared to be in a seemingly normal state of health </p>

<p>after the high dose of b-cytotoxin for at least 6 weeks. This 
indicates that in the absence of glucagon action, insulin 
deficiency in mice is a silent disorder without overt meta-
bolic or clinical manifestations, confirming an earlier pre-
liminary observation in alloxan-treated mice (11). It also 
suggests that glucagon suppression and/or antagonism may 
be an extremely useful strategy to treat type 1 diabetes. 
Other than fasting hypoglycemia, no significant un-
desirable side effects of chronic blockade of glucagon 
action were observed in this brief study. The marked a-cell 
hyperplasia observed in Gcgr 2/2 pancreata (19) has led to 
concerns that long-term glucagon receptor blockade could </p>

predispose to glucagonoma. However, thus far glucago-
noma has not been observed in any of the Gcgr 2/2 mice 
followed for up to 2 years (M.J.C., unpublished observa-
tion). Another theoretical hazard is the possibility of pre-
disposition to lactic acidosis based on the high blood 
lactate levels in the Gcgr 2/2 mice. This is attributed to 
reduced gluconeogenesis secondary to downregulation of 
gluconeogenic genes. A third potential issue relates to the 
role of glucagon in amino acid homeostasis. Amino acid 
deficiency has been described in glucagonoma patients 
(33,34), raising the possibility that Gcgr 2/2 mice might 
have high amino acid levels, as reported by Boden et al. 
(31) in humans in whom glucagon was suppressed by so-
matostatin. For this reason, we measured amino acid lev-
els in the livers of our normal and STZ-treated Gcgr +/+ and 
Gcgr 2/2 mice. As shown in Table 2, eight of the nine he-
patic amino acids measured were significantly higher in 
Gcgr 2/2 mice with intact b-cells than in normal Gcgr +/+ 
mice. But no such differences occurred in STZ-treated 
mice, suggesting that insulin action, when unopposed by 
glucagon, was responsible for the increase. 
By far the most surprising result of the study was the 
normal glucose tolerance of insulin-deficient Gcgr 2/2 
mice. Currently, it is believed that it is the action of glu-
cose-stimulated insulin secretion on hepatic glucose bal-
ance and glucose uptake in muscle and fat that is the 
essential determinant of glucose tolerance, with glucagon 
suppression playing a supporting role. Here we find that 
both oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance in Gcgr 2/2 
mice with b-cell destruction is as normal as in Gcgr +/+ mice 
with intact islets, even though no rise in insulin was 
detected in peripheral plasma of the former. Although we 
did not measure portal vein insulin levels, the lack of 
preproinsulin mRNA in the mice that received double-dose 
STZ argues against undetected insulin reaching the liver. 
The presence of residual granules in STZ-treated pancreata 
does not necessarily signify a residual insulin source be-
cause insulin granules may persist in apoptotic b-cells or 
in macrophages after all functioning b-cells have been 
destroyed. Certainly in wild-type mice, neither the "re-
sidual" insulin in the pancreas nor the low levels of 
"plasma insulin" were able to prevent a ketoacidotic death. 
The lack of preproinsulin mRNA detectable by qRT-PCR, 
which is far more sensitive and specific than either of the 
immunologic techniques, suggests that the STZ-treated 
mice were unable to produce insulin. 
It seemed possible that the insulin-like responses were 
caused by an increase in a hormone with insulinometic 
activity. But neither leptin (not shown) (11) nor IGF-1 rose 
significantly in response to the glucose challenge. Alter-
natively, the elevated glucagon-like peptide 1 levels might 
have increased muscle glucose uptake (32). 
Recent studies by Meyer et al. (35) indicate that in 
normal humans 90% of ingested glucose is taken up by 
liver, muscle, brain, and kidney, and hepatic glucose re-
lease declines 82%. Except for the brain, red cells, and 
possibly the kidney, glucose uptake is considered to be 
insulin-mediated. To account for the perfectly normal 
glucose tolerance in insulin-deficient mice with congenital 
lack of glucagon action, one can posit that insulin action 
during glucose absorption is largely directed toward 
overcoming the hepatic actions of glucagon during the 
preglucose fast. In this case, if glucagon action on the liver 
is absent, there is little, if anything, for insulin to do be-
cause the liver is already in a permanent storage mode. 
Therefore, when the liver has never experienced the action </p>

<p>of glucagon, as in the Gcgr 2/2 mice, glucose disposition 
without insulin is no different than when both hormones 
are normally active (36). It should also be noted that 
fasting and fed FFA levels (Fig. 3A) were both lower in 
insulin-deficient Gcgr 2/2 mice than in insulin-deficient 
Gcgr +/+ mice, suggesting that, at least when unopposed by 
insulin, glucagon may have lipolytic action in adipocytes, 
as it does in hepatocytes. 
Finally, a persistent but fallacious argument against an 
essential role of glucagon in diabetes is the occurrence of 
diabetes in totally depancreatized humans and animals. It 
is not widely appreciated that when totally depancreatized 
animals or humans are deprived of insulin, there is an in-
creased production of glucagon from extrapancreatic 
a-cells (37) in the stomach and upper small bowel (38-43). 
Suppression of the extrapancreatic hyperglucagonemia 
restores hyperglycemia to normal (44). 
Taken together these findings indicate in mice that type 
1 diabetes can be converted into an asymptomatic, benign, 
noncatabolic, insulin-independent disorder by elimination 
of glucagon action. These studies support the clinical 
utility of the development of potent Gcgr antagonists and/ 
or glucagon suppressors capable of eliminating the lethal 
glucagon-dependent component of type 1 diabetes (45). </p>
