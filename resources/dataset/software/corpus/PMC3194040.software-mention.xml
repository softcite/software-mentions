<p>An inactive protease domain mediates DEG7 protease oligomerization </p>



<p>feature of Deg/HtrA proteases in bacteria and mammals, the active 
protease domain of plant DEG7 is not essential for this process. 
Instead, the second (degenerated) protease domain is responsible 
for the trimerization of DEG7 in plants. 
Inactive protease domains were reported from the proteolytic 
active oligomers of other proteases. Clp proteases in bacteria, 
for example, are oligomeric serine proteases with a proteolytic 
core constituted by two heptameric rings, with each heptamer 
composed of identical proteolytically active ClpP subunits [37]. 
In chloroplasts of plants and in cyanobacteria, however, the Clp 
protease core is a heteroheptamer, containing three proteolytically 
active ClpP subunits and four inactive ClpR variants, which show 
sequence similarity to ClpP on the amino acid level, but lack the 
catalytic triad of serine type proteases [38,39]. A high sequence 
similarity between the inactive ClpR and the active ClpP variants 
indicates a common ancestor [40]. This is supported by the fact 
that loss of the catalytic triad appears to be ongoing process since 
some cyanobacterial ClpR variants still retain one of the active-
site residues [39]. 
A similar situation was reported for the 20S proteolytically 
active core unit of the 26S proteasome. This core unit is composed 
of four stacked heptameric rings. In Archaea, the two inner rings 
are homo-oligomers of proteolytically active β-subunits, whereas, 
in eukaryotes, the β-subunit has diverged into seven different 
β-proteins (reviewed in [41,42]). Of these seven β-subunits, only 
three contain the active-site residues and are proteolytically active. 
Despite the lack of enzymatic activity, the inactive β-subunits are 
essential for the correct assembly of the eukaryotic proteasome. 
In the case of ClpP from photosynthetic organisms and the pro-
teasome from eukaryotes, formerly active protease domains (or, 
in these cases, one-domain subunits) evolved into domains with 
tasks other than proteolysis, e.g. mediating subunit contacts in the 
oligomeric protease complex. The second (degenerated) protease 
domain of DEG7, which is described in the present paper, might 
be yet another example, where a formerly active enzymatic entity 
is now involved in the oligomerization of the protease complex. 
For Deg/HtrA proteases, inactive protease domains involved in 
oligomer formation have not been described so far. In contrast 
with ClpP and the proteasome, however, this inactive domain 
is not encoded by a separate gene, but is a part of the same 
polypeptide chain as the active protease domain. </p>

on histidine-free medium contains the second protease domain in at least one construct. The AD-first half, BD-first half, AD-active protease domain, and BD-active protease domain constructs 
respectively mediated growth on histidine-free medium in at least some combinations, indicating that lack of gene expression in the combinations first half/first half and active protease domain/active
