<p>This article examines the effect of tobacco prices on the decision to start smoking in 
Argentina. Argentina is an interesting case to explore given its high smoking rates, its 
recent experience with periods of very high and hyperinflation, and the mixed evidence of 
the effect of prices on smoking onset, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. 
We used data from four cycles of two large national surveys conducted between 2005 and 
2011 and discrete-time hazard models. We found that tobacco prices had a statistically 
significant and fairly large impact on the hazard of smoking onset, and these findings 
were robust to alternative specifications. We also found that prices had little effect 
on the hazards of smoking onset during periods of hyper-and very high inflation, 
which provide some support for the notion that prices lose their informational role in 
such periods. Governments need to be cognizant that their most important policy tool 
to reduce tobacco use-taxes that increase real tobacco prices-is likely no longer 
effective during these times. (JEL C41, H20, I12, I18) </p>

<p>Tobacco use causes more than 6 million deaths 
per year worldwide, a number that is expected 
to rise to more than 8 million by 2030. The 
majority of these deaths will occur in low-and 
middle-income countries (LMIC) where 80% of 
the deaths are expected to take place by 2030 </p>

long-term consequences of smoking, smok-
ing during childhood and adolescence causes 
serious contemporaneous health problems. The 
US Surgeon General concluded in 2012 that 
there was sufficient evidence to support a causal 
relationship between active smoking during 
childhood and adolescence and reduced lung 
function, impaired lung growth, and wheezing 
severe enough to be diagnosed as asthma. There 
is also emerging evidence that youth smoking 
is associated with various developmental and 
mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, 
anxiety, and depression (US Department of 
Health and Human Services 2012). Moreover,

<p>GUINDON, PARAJE &amp; CHÁVEZ: PRICES, INFLATION, AND SMOKING ONSET IN ARGENTINA </p>



<p>tobacco use hinders sustainable development and 
has been formally recognized as a priority for 
health interventions by the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly in its Sustainable Development 
Goals (de Beyer, Lovelace, and Yurekli 2001; 
Collishaw 2010; United Nations 2015). 
In Latin America, 13% of deaths among 
persons aged 35 years and older can be attributed 
to tobacco use (IECS 2014). In Argentina, 
tobacco smoking is responsible for more than 
40,000 deaths every year and almost 10% of all 
disability-adjusted life years lost (IHME 2013; 
Pichon-Riviere et al. 2013). In Argentina, about 
30% of men and 16% of women were current 
smokers in 2012 (MSAL and INDEC 2013; 
World Health Organization 2015). Argentina is 
one of the very few countries that has not seen 
any appreciable decreases in cigarette consump-
tion over the past two decades. Compared to 
its neighbor Uruguay that has instituted exten-
sive tobacco control measures, Argentina fares 
particularly poorly (Abascal et al. 2012). 
A recent systematic review examined the 
impact of tobacco prices or taxes on tobacco 
use in Latin American and Caribbean countries 
and found that cigarette prices had a negative 
and statistically significant effect on cigarette 
consumption (Guindon, Paraje, and Chaloupka 
2015). The review concluded that in most Latin 
American countries, total own-price elasticity 
for cigarettes was likely below |-0.5| but noted 
a lack of studies that used individual-level data. 
The systematic review identified two sets of 
studies that used aggregate time series data from 
Argentina (Gonzáles-Rozada and Rodriguez 
Iglesias 2013; Martinez, Mejia, and Perez-
Stable 2015). Estimates were remarkably similar 
across studies and suggested a long-run price 
elasticity for cigarettes of about −0.3. Studies that 
use aggregate time series data such as national 
cigarette consumption or sales are unable to 
examine the effect that tax or price changes 
have on smoking participation, consumption, 
onset or cessation, or different responses across 
groups (e.g., across individuals of different 
socioeconomic status [SES]). Another recent 
review examined the impact of tobacco prices 
on smoking onset (i.e., the transition between 
never smoking and smoking) and concluded that 
existing studies did not provide strong evidence 
that tobacco prices or taxes affect smoking onset, 
in part due to a reliance on empirical approaches 
that were methodologically weak (Guindon 
2014a, 2014b). Moreover, the review identified 
only three studies that were conducted using </p>

<p>data from LMIC (China, Russia, and Vietnam) 
(Laxminarayan and Deolalikar 2004; Arzhen-
ovskiy 2006; Kenkel, Lillard, and Liu 2009). The 
review also identified one study that used cross-
country data from non-representative national 
or sub-national surveys of school-children and 
-teens conducted in 48 LMIC (Kostova 2013). 
More recently, the impact of prices on smoking 
onset has been examined using data from China, 
South Africa, and Vietnam (Guindon 2014a; 
Kostova, Husain, and Chaloupka 2016; Vellios 
and van Walbeek 2016). On the whole, none of 
the existing studies are easily generalizable to 
Latin American countries. 1 
Argentina's situation presents a unique oppor-
tunity to examine price responsiveness in a 
high-inflation environment. During most of its 
recent history, Argentina experienced some 
of the world's most acute inflation episodes. 
Between 1980 and 1991, overall prices increased 
by more than 8,000,000,000%; in 1990 alone 
inflation neared 5,000%. This period of high 
inflation was followed by a rapid price stabiliza-
tion process, which saw inflation fall to 83% in 
1991, 17.5% in 1992, and 7.4% in 1993. Prices 
have been relatively stable since the early 1990s, 
but even so, overall prices increased by about 
185%-350% between 2000 and 2011 (Cavallo 
2013; INDEC 2014; International Monetary 
Fund 2015). Economic and political actors have 
become so sensitive to general price increases 
that in recent years the National Statistical Office 
has been accused of deliberately reporting lower 
inflation figures (International Monetary Fund 
2013; The Economist 2012, 2014). 
In market-based economies prices play an 
important informational role; current prices are 
signals of future prices. Ball and Romer (2003) 
argued that high inflation has an important </p>

<p>1. Price responsiveness may differ between high-income 
countries and lower-income countries and between Latin 
American and non-Latin American countries for a number of 
reasons. First, Warner (1990) argued that price responsiveness 
of tobacco users in LMIC ought to be substantially higher 
than users in more affluent countries because LMIC con-
sumers have relatively fewer resources. Second, Chaloupka 
et al. (2000, 246) pointed out that "economic models of addic-
tion suggest that the generally lower level of education in 
lower-income countries is likely to make the demand for 
tobacco products in these countries relatively more responsive 
to changes in monetary prices than demand in higher-income 
countries." Third, there is evidence that consumers with dif-
ferent levels of income or wealth behave differently when it 
comes to choices involving intertemporal trade-offs; poorer 
consumers are likely more impatient than more affluent ones 
(Carvalho 2010). Fourth, the availability and prices of substi-
tutes and complements may well differ between national or 
regional markets (e.g., local distilled alcoholic beverages). </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>twofold effect on the relationship between 
prices and demand. First, inflation reduces the 
informativeness of current prices, causing cus-
tomers to make costly mistakes about which 
long-term relationships to enter. Second, because 
prices have become less informative, they have 
less influence on consumers' decision, and as 
demand becomes less elastic, producers increase 
their mark-ups. Ball and Romer argued that both 
effects can be quantitatively important at mod-
erate inflation rates. Between 1980 and 1991, 
inflation was anything but moderate in Argentina 
fluctuating between 80% and 5,000% annually. 
Such high rates of inflation may lead markets to 
break down completely. In the context of smok-
ing, during high inflation periods in which prices 
provide little information, prices may cease to 
have any effects on tobacco use generally and 
smoking onset in particular. Consequently, it 
may be the case that governments lose their 
most potent policy tool to reduce tobacco use 
(i.e., taxes that increase real tobacco prices) 
during periods of high inflation. High inflation, 
however, may affect smoking decisions through 
other pathways than price. For example, Deaton 
(1977) suggested that unanticipated inflation 
may lead consumers to believe that all goods are 
more expensive and result in a decrease in real 
consumption. Inflation may impact time prefer-
ence, which may in turn affect smoking (Gong 
2006; Khwaja, Silverman, and Sloan 2007). Or 
times of high inflation may lead to increased 
stress which in turn may effect smoking onset 
(Finkelstein, Kubzansky, and Goodman 2006; 
Iakunchykova et al. 2015). 
Argentina is an important producer of tobacco 
leaf and one of the very few countries not 
to have ratified WHO's Framework Conven-
tion on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The 2011 
National Tobacco Law, which came into effect 
in 2013, generally follows the recommenda-
tions of the FCTC including a ban on smoking 
in all indoor areas. Provinces, however, have 
unevenly implemented important provisions of 
the National Tobacco Law. The general lack 
of leadership at the federal level has led many 
provinces and some municipalities to introduce 
smokefree policies prior to the National Tobacco 
Law. There is some evidence that smokefree 
policies decreased acute coronary syndrome 
admissions after their implementation in the 
province of Santa Fe and the city of Buenos 
Aires and improved respiratory health in the 
city of Neuquen (Ferrante et al. 2012; Schoj 
et al. 2010). Although most tobacco advertising, </p>

<p>promotion, and sponsorship were banned in 
2013, advertising at point of sale is still pervasive. 
Prior to 2013, tobacco advertising, promotion, 
and sponsorship were widespread. Advertis-
ing and promotion were loosely regulated in 
1986 by Law 23.344, which also mandated a 
warning label for cigarettes. Argentina's two 
leading multinationals-Massalin Particulares 
(Philip Morris) and Nobleza-Piccardo (British-
American Tobacco)-control nearly 100% of 
the Argentinian cigarette market (ERC 2014). 
Argentina's overall tax system is extremely 
complex; the structure of tobacco taxation, and in 
particular, the taxation of cigarettes, even more 
so. In addition to general taxes such as value-
added tax that are broadly applied to most goods 
and services, Argentina uses two taxes that are 
specifically applied to cigarettes. First, an ad val-
orem tax (impuestos internos or internal tax) is 
applied on the retail price of cigarettes (minus 
other taxes) at a rate of 75%, last changed in 
May 2016 (the rate had been 60% since 1996). 
In 2004, a minimum tax revenue condition was 
introduced which stipulates that the revenue from 
the internal tax cannot be less than 75% of the 
tax levied on the most popular brand. In January 
1996, Argentina introduced an ad valorem emer-
gency tax (Impuesto Adicional de Emergencia 
[IAE]) at a rate of 7% of the retail price, net of all 
taxes, later increased to 31% in December 1999. 
The IAE was subsequently decreased to 16, 12 
and finally 7% in February 2001. There is also a 
relatively small dedicated tax (Fondo Especial del 
Tabaco) that is used to support tobacco growers. 
Recently, nominal cigarette price increases have 
been set by agreement between the Ministry of 
Finance and the tobacco industry to reach partic-
ular tax collection objectives (Rodriguez-Iglesias 
et al. 2015), though very little information is pub-
licly available for the terms of these agreements. 
Since the early 2000s and until very recently, 
on the whole, taxes on cigarettes have either 
remained relatively stable or have decreased. 
More importantly, cigarettes in Argentina have 
become more affordable: both overall inflation 
and incomes have outpaced increases in nominal 
cigarette prices since the early 2000s (Rodriguez-
Iglesias et al. 2015). Figure 1 presents a timeline 
of key tobacco control measures and key politi-
cal, monetary, and inflation events. 
The overall mixed evidence from high-income 
countries, the growing but still limited evidence 
from LMIC, and the lack of evidence from Latin 
American countries calls for additional analyses 
of the impact of tobacco prices or taxes on </p>

<p>smoking onset. Moreover, Argentina is a partic-
ularly interesting case to examine in this regard 
since it is a middle-income country with high 
smoking rates coupled with recent periods of very 
high inflation. Our objective is to examine the 
relationship between cigarette prices and smok-
ing onset in Argentina while giving special atten-
tion to overall price inflation, tobacco control 
policies, and sex and socioeconomic differences 
in the effect of prices on smoking onset. </p>

<p>II. DATA AND METHODS </p>

<p>A. Data </p>

<p>As a measure of nominal cigarette prices, 
we used the manufactured tobacco component 
(of which cigarettes represent nearly 100%) 
of Argentina's consumer price index (CPI) 
for Greater Buenos Aires (Índice de Precios 
al Consumo Gran Buenos Aires [IPC]) from 
the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos 
(INDEC). This approach is not problematic as 
individuals residing outside Greater Buenos 
Aires face the same cigarette prices as those 
residing in that area (i.e., cigarette prices do not 
vary by neighborhood or regions in Argentina). 
Other countries such as Chile and France have 
similar "uniform" price regulations (i.e., prices 
vary between brands, but the prices of individual 
brands do not vary across space). These data were 
available from January 1980 to May 2008. From 
May 2008 to 2011, we used the after-tax monthly 
weighted average price for a pack of 20 cigarettes 
reported by the Ministerio de Agricultura, 
Ganadería y Pesca, as INDEC stopped reporting 
CPI for individual categories in May 2008. 2 </p>

<p>2. The Pearson correlation coefficient between CPI-
tobacco and cigarette weighted average prices for the period 
1994 and 2008 is &gt;0.99. </p>

<p>We adjusted all nominal prices for overall 
inflation. As a measure of overall inflation, we 
used CPI all-items for Greater Buenos Aires 
(IPC nivel general) which was available for the 
period 1980-2011. The quality, or lack thereof, 
of INDEC's CPI figures from 2007 is well docu-
mented (International Monetary Fund 2013; The 
Economist 2012, 2014). In February 2013, after 
several warnings, the International Monetary 
Fund issued a declaration of censure against 
Argentina. As an alternative measure of inflation 
from January 2007, we used estimates for the 
Sante Fe province (the second largest province, 
situated in the central region) calculated and 
reported by the Sante Fe statistical office. As a 
sensitivity check, we used estimates calculated 
by MIT's Billion Prices Project (Cavallo 2013) 
and State Street, a financial services firm. The 
latter series began in December 2007. 
Figure 2 shows changes in the real prices of 
cigarettes from 1980. The 1980s were character-
ized by high volatility. For example, between Jan-
uary 1980 and June 1982, real cigarette prices 
increased by nearly 60% before plunging by 
about 80% over the next 28 months. Such extreme 
price swings occurred throughout the 1980s. The 
abrupt drops in the real prices of cigarettes are 
explained by pronounced increases in the gen-
eral inflation and not by decreases in the nominal 
prices of cigarettes. Overall inflation subsided 
in the early 1990s and coincided with a fairly 
long and sustained decrease in real cigarette 
prices (from mid-1991 to the early of 1996). For 
the remainder of the 1990s, real cigarette prices 
remained fairly stable, with the exception of one 
real price hike in early 1996. Volatility in prices 
returned in the 2000s, albeit to a much lesser 
extent than the 1980s. From 2007, trends in real 
prices depend greatly on which estimates of over-
all inflation are used. From 2007, Figure 2 shows </p>

<p>estimates using the official INDEC inflation and 
the estimates from the province of Sante Fe and 
from MIT/State Street. Differences are obvious, 
substantial, and provide support to our decision 
to use alternative measures of inflation. 
We used data from two national surveys. First, 
we used data from the Encuesta Nacional Fac-
tores de Riesgo (ENFR) conducted in 2005 and 
2009. ENFR is a risk factor survey that is repre-
sentative at national and province level for urban 
populations (about 90% of Argentines live in 
urban areas). 
ENFR is a large cross-sectional survey with 
relatively high response rates; in 2005 and 2009, 
data are available for about 45,000 (response 
rate, 87%) and 35,000 (response rate, 74%) 
individuals aged 18-65 years, respectively. Sec-
ond, we used data from the Encuesta Nacional 
sobre Prevalencias de Consumo de Sustancias 
Psicoactivas (ENPreCoSP) conducted in 2008 
and 2011. ENPreCoSP is a substance abuse 
survey. As ENFR, it is representative at national 
and province level for urban populations, has 
large sample sizes (&gt;30,000) and relatively high 
response rates (72% in 2008 and 73% in 2011). 
The target population, 16-65 years, is similar 
to that of ENFR. Both ENFR and ENPreCoSP 
used a similar multi-stratified sampling approach 
covering urban areas with population over 5,000 
inhabitants, and both had the same extensive 
tobacco use module. </p>

<p>We created a measure of the age of smok-
ing onset from the self-reported response to the 
question "How old were you when you smoked 
for the first time?" and include only smokers 
who responded positively to the question "Have 
you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life-
time?" ENFR data collection occurred from April 
to June 2005 and from October to December 2009 
while ENPreCoSP data were collected in May 
and June 2008 and from August to October 2011. 
Given the month of interview and respondents' 
self-reported age of smoking onset, it is possible 
to bound the age of onset within intervals of 24 
or 12 months. 3 Instead of picking the mid-point 
as is commonly done, we randomly selected, 
using a uniform distribution, a month within each 
interval. We assumed that individuals were first 
exposed to the risk of starting to smoke at age 
8. Consequently, individuals older than 8 in 1980 
and those who reported starting smoking before 
age 8 were excluded. Put differently, individu-
als that were older than 33, 36, 37, and 39 when 
surveyed in 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2011, respec-
tively, were excluded. As sensitivity checks, we 
also assumed that individuals were first exposed 
to the risk of starting to smoke at age 0, 5, and 11. 
Respondents with missing or nonsensical data 
(e.g., age of smoking onset greater than age </p>

<p>3. The interval is only 12 months when age and age of 
smoking onset are the same. </p>

<p>GUINDON, PARAJE &amp; CHÁVEZ: PRICES, INFLATION, AND SMOKING ONSET IN ARGENTINA </p>



<p>at time of survey) were dropped. Overall, we 
dropped about 1% of individual observations 
from our pooled sample and no more than 1.5% 
for any single survey/cycle. We also created a 
dataset that kept age groups consistent across sur-
veys and cycles by keeping only individuals that 
were between 16 and 33 years old at interview. 
In addition to our measure of real cigarette 
price that enters models as a time varying covari-
ate, we included measures of tobacco control 
policies and a measure of real alcohol price. We 
included a dummy variable to control for the 
introduction of Law 23.344 in May 1986 (weak 
ad ban and health warnings). We also created 
a variable that varies across time and space to 
examine the effect of the introduction of smoke-
free policies at province level. To explore the 
possible effect that alcohol prices may have on 
smoking onset, we included a measure of average 
prices of alcohol beverages based on the alco-
hol component of Argentina's CPI for Greater 
Buenos Aires. Decker and Schwartz (2000) argue 
that if alcohol and cigarettes are important substi-
tutes (or complements), then a correctly specified 
cigarette demand equation should include prices 
of alcoholic beverages. 
To examine the potential effect of hyper-and 
very high inflation on smoking onset we cre-
ated dichotomous indicators. Defining hyper-, 
very high, or high inflation is inherently sub-
jective. First, we followed Fischer, Sahay, and 
Végh (2002) and used Cagan's classic definition 
of hyperinflation (Cagan 1956). Cagan defines 
hyperinflation "as beginning in the month the rise 
in prices exceeds 50 percent and as ending in the 
month before the monthly rise in prices drops 
below that amount and stays below for at least 
a year" (Fischer, Sahay, and Végh 2002, 840). 
Second, we followed Fisher et al.'s approach to 
define very high inflation. Very high inflationary 
episode is defined as taking place when the 12-
month inflation rate rises above 100%. Cagan's 
definition indicates that Argentina experienced 
hyperinflation from May 1989 to March 1990 
while Fischer, Sahay, and Végh's indicates that 
Argentina experienced very high inflation from 
July 1974 to October 1991. All other variables are 
time-invariant. As a measure of socioeconomic 
status, we used educational attainment of the 
household head (three binary indicators, primary, 
secondary, and more than secondary). This mea-
sure of SES, however, is inherently time-varying, 
but due to the nature of the data, enters models 
as a time invariant variable. Given the relatively 
young age of the respondents in our sample, we </p>

<p>feel that SES at the time of survey is a reasonable 
proxy for SES at the time at which individuals 
were at risk of starting smoking. Moreover, inter-
generational income mobility is relatively low in 
Argentina (Jimenez and Gasparini 2010). Other 
individual covariates include sex and geographi-
cal region. </p>

<p>B. Methods </p>

<p>We used discrete-time hazard models and a 
complementary loglog (cloglog) specification; 
unlike logit or probit, cloglog has a response 
curve that is asymmetric (Box-Steffensmeier and 
Jones 2004; Jenkins 1995; Singer and Willett 
1993). One advantage of duration or survival 
models is their ability to take into account obser-
vations that are censored (in our case, individuals 
who have not yet started smoking at interview). 
Discrete-time hazard models have been used 
fairly extensively to examine the effect of prices 
on smoking onset (for recent examples, see Etile 
and Jones 2011; Guindon 2014a; Nonnemaker 
and Farrelly 2011). As a functional form for the 
baseline hazard function, we used a cubic poly-
nomial specification. As a sensitivity check, we 
also used a more flexible approach and used a 
dummy specification for time at risk, measured in 
years. An even more flexible approach would use 
a dummy specification for time at risk measured 
in months. Such an approach, however, requires 
the inclusion of a large number of unknown 
parameters, is computationally demanding, and is 
fraught with convergence problems. 
Standard survival/duration models assume 
that the probability of eventual failure is greater 
than zero for all individuals (Boag 1949; Forster 
and Jones 2001; Schmidt and Witte 1989). Given 
that a large proportion of individuals never start 
smoking, we also used discrete time split popu-
lation models. 4 All models were estimated using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Stata/MP</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">14.1</rs> with sampling weights. Split 
population models were estimated using spsurv 
developed by Jenkins without sampling weights. 5 
Finally, we conducted a number of sensi-
tivity checks to ensure that our main results 
were not sensitive to alternative specifications. </p>

<p>4. A number of studies have used a split population 
approach to examine the effect of prices on smoking onset. 
See for example, Douglas and Hariharan (1994), Douglas 
(1998), Forster and Jones (2001), López Nicolás (2002), Kidd 
and Hopkins (2004), Madden (2007), and Guindon (2014a). 
5. spsurv, however, does not allow the use of sampling 
weights nor does it allow the inclusion of covariates in the 
participation component of the model. </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>First, we re-estimated models without sampling 
weights. In creating our retrospective dataset, we 
are assuming that the collection of individuals 
represented by each subject represents a collec-
tion of individuals at the time they were at risk 
of starting. Second, the assumption that the haz-
ard function given age and other covariates does 
not change with calendar time may not be valid. 
However, it is difficult to identify calendar time 
and duration effects separately when one includes 
a measure of calendar time as they are correlated 
by construction. Hence, it is generally not recom-
mended to include a measure of calendar time 
in duration models. We used a somewhat less 
problematic specification and estimated models 
that control for differing birth cohorts (Korn, 
Graubard, and Midthune 1997). We used as a cal-
endar time predictor a variable that describes the 
calendar year that corresponds to the first calen-
dar year at which each individual was first at risk 
of starting. 6 Third, we re-estimated all models 
using annual data. 
Generally, price elasticity estimates may be 
biased because of the endogeneity of the price 
variable. First, when using survey data, the prob-
lem of price endogeneity is less of a concern 
because no individual tobacco user (or potential 
user in our case) consumes enough to influence 
the market price. Second, price endogeneity is 
of particular concern if one uses self-reported 
prices; we used a measure of tobacco prices con-
structed from retail prices. Third, increases in 
cigarette taxes may be proxies for unobserved 
sentiment against cigarette smoking (i.e., changes 
in anti-smoking sentiment may drive higher taxes 
and prices) (Chaloupka and Warner 2000). In the 
Argentinian context, it is unlikely that changes 
in anti-smoking sentiment were associated with 
changes in cigarette prices. As shown in Figure 2, 
to be correlated with prices, anti-smoking senti-
ment would have had to fluctuate in an extremely 
unusual fashion (e.g., decrease from the early 
1990s, then suddenly increase, followed by a 
sharp decrease and an even sharper increase in 
the early 2000s). Moreover, there is no indi-
cation that the national government ever had a 
public health objective to increase prices (driven 
or not by "anti-smoking sentiment"). From the 
2000s and until very recently, taxes actually 
decreased and the opaque agreement between </p>

<p>6. We also used as a calendar time predictor the first 
calendar year (measured in units of 5 years) at which each 
individual was first at risk of starting (i.e., 1980-1984, 
1985-1989, 1990-1994, 1995-1999, and &gt;2000). </p>

<p>the Ministry of Finance and the tobacco industry 
had for objective to reach particular tax col-
lection objectives, not a public health objec-
tive (see Rodriguez-Iglesias et al. 2015 for more 
details). Consequently, we feel that our measure 
of cigarette prices is plausibly exogenous. </p>

<p>III. RESULTS </p>

<p>Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. 
Nearly 50% of all individuals included in our 
sample started smoking and, on average, those 
who did were about 16 years of age. A little over 
half of our sample are women, and most resided 
in the province (40%) or city (9%) of Buenos 
Aires at interview. Approximately 40% of house-
hold heads had not attended secondary school 
while less than one-fourth had studied beyond 
secondary school. There are no marked differ-
ences between surveys and cycles. Figures 3 
and 4 plot, for men and women, Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) product-limit survivor and hazard func-
tions assuming that individuals were exposed 
to the risk of starting to smoke at age 8. Both 
figures suggest potentially important differences 
between men and women. Figure 4 shows clearly 
that the hazard rates among Argentine men and 
women are non-monotonic, which provides 
support for our choice of functional form for the 
baseline hazard function. 
Tables 2-5 present the results of the discrete-
time complementary loglog (cloglog) duration 
models. We began with parsimonious models. 
First, we only included, in addition to price, 
indicators for sex, provinces, and surveys/cycles 
(Table 2, model 1). We then included in turn, 
household's educational attainment, tobacco 
control policies, alcohol prices and inflation 
(models 2-6). For models 7-9, as our measure 
of price, we used tobacco prices that have been 
adjusted for inflation using the full INDEC 
overall inflation series. 
For covariates measured in natural logarithmic 
such as our price measures, coefficients repre-
sent the elasticity of the hazard with respect to a 
regressor. A negative coefficient indicates that the 
hazard rate or risk of event decreases for higher 
values of a covariate. For example, a price coef-
ficient of −0.5 indicates that a 1% increase in the 
price of tobacco products would reduce the haz-
ard or risk of smoking onset by 0.5%. Hazard 
ratios (i.e., the exponential of the reported coeffi-
cients) are more intuitive to assess the effects of 
dichotomous indicators. For example, in Table 2, 
a hazard ratio of 0.7 (i.e., exp.(−0.36)) suggests </p>

ing than men and that the difference between the 
hazards of men and women is about 43%. 7 
All models suggest a fairly large, negative, 
and statistically significant association between 
prices of tobacco products and the hazard of 
smoking onset. Price elasticity estimates from our 
preferred specifications (Table 2, models 1 to 6) 
fall within a fairly narrow range centered around 
−0.45. Including additional covariates does not 
alter price elasticity estimates in any signifi-
cant or substantial way. Specifications that used 
tobacco prices adjusted for inflation using the full 
INDEC overall inflation series yield estimates </p>

<p>7. As the models estimated are nonlinear, the comparison 
of hazard ratios across such models with different sets of 
covariates should be done with caution (Norton 2012). </p>

<p>that are between about 45% and 60% higher 
(in absolute value) (Table 2, models 7-9). These 
estimates are, however, not statistically signifi-
cantly different than estimates obtained using our 
alternative measure of overall inflation. 
The introduction of health warnings and 
advertising and promotion regulations in May 
1986 and provincial smokefree policies intro-
duced in the mid-to late 2000s are generally 
associated with a decreased hazard of smoking 
initiation. Women and higher SES individuals 
appear to be at lower risk of smoking onset than 
men and low SES individuals; the differences 
between SES levels, however, are fairly small. 
Our measures of hyper-and very high inflation 
do not, on the whole, suggest that the hazards 
of smoking onset were any different in times 
of hyper-or very high inflation. We found that </p>

<p>such as Catamarca, Chaco, Formosa, Jujuy, La 
Rioja, Salta, Misiones, and Santiago del Estero 
show a considerably lower hazard of smoking 
onset. These differences occurred despite the 
vicinity of Paraguay (a major source of contra-
band cigarettes) for provinces such as Formosa, 
Misiones, and Chaco or being a major tobacco-
growing province such as Salta. 
Table 3 presents results of models that exam-
ine differences in the effect of prices on smok-
ing onset across sex, SES, and between high 
and low inflation periods. We interacted, in turn, 
prices with sex, household head's highest edu-
cation level, and our binary measures of periods 
of hyper-or very high inflation. First, we found 
that women were about twice more responsive to 
changes in prices than men. Second, we did not 
find that low-SES individuals were more respon-
sive than individuals of higher SES. If anything, 
our findings suggest that individuals with higher 
SES were more responsive to price. Lastly, we 
found striking differences in the effect of prices 
on smoking onset between inflation periods. We 
found that prices had no effects whatsoever on 
smoking onset during periods of hyper-or very 
high inflation. 
Table 4 presents results of models that seek 
to examine differences in the effect of prices 
by SES subgroups, between high and low infla-
tion periods. We found that, regardless of the </p>

<p>SES subgroups, individuals were not responsive 
to prices in very high and hyperinflation peri-
ods. Additionally, individuals of lower SES (i.e., 
whose household head had less than a secondary 
school education) were not found to be price 
responsive in either period. </p>

<p>A. Sensitivity Analyses </p>

<p>To ensure our results were robust to alterna-
tive specifications, we conducted a number of 
sensitivity checks. Table 5 presents results using 
the dataset we created that retained only indi-
viduals that were between 16 and 33 years old 
when interviewed. Estimates of own-and cross-
price elasticities are, on the whole, robust to this 
alternative approach. Results for some covariates, 
however, are sensitive to this specification. First, 
low-and high-SES individuals do not appear to 
have different hazards of smoking initiation. Sec-
ond, these results do not suggest a negative asso-
ciation between Law 23.344 enacted in 1986 and 
the hazard of smoking onset. 
We also examined the robustness of our results 
to alternative specifications for age when first at 
risk and for the functional form for the baseline 
hazard function, estimated models that do not 
assume that all individuals will eventually start 
smoking, estimated models using annual instead 
of monthly data, and estimated models without </p>

<p>negative, and statistically significant association 
between prices of tobacco products and the haz-
ard of smoking onset. We did found, however, on 
the whole, greater variations between specifica-
tions. Using data measured annually instead of 
monthly did not change our results in any sig-
nificant or substantial way. On the whole, these 
results were in line with results obtained using 
monthly data; estimates of own-price and cross-
price elasticities were similar or somewhat higher 
(in absolute value). Our analyses without sam-
pling weights did not reveal any substantive dif-
ferences in price effects. 
Finally, we attempted to control for calendar 
year effects. With one exception, all model spec-
ifications suggested price elasticities that were 
statistically significant. On the whole, estimates </p>

<p>of price elasticities were somewhat lower (in 
absolute value); estimates of own-price elastic-
ities ranged from about −0.25 to −0.3 while 
estimates of cross-price elasticities were fairly 
narrowly centered around 0.45. All model spec-
ifications that included calendar year indicators 
and a measure of very high inflation (i.e., Fisher 
et al.'s definition [January 1980-October 1991]) 
yielded price elasticities that were not statistically 
significantly different than 0. </p>

<p>IV. DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Our results suggest that tobacco prices had 
a statistically significant, robust to alternative 
specifications (with one exception), and fairly 
large impact on the hazard of smoking onset (see </p>

<p>evidence that tobacco control policies may have 
reduced the hazard of smoking onset. 
The International Agency for Research on 
Cancer (2011) in its comprehensive review 
concluded that most studies that jointly exam-
ined the effect of cigarette and alcohol prices 
on tobacco found negative cross-price effects, 
which suggested that tobacco and alcohol were 
complements. Nearly all studies, however, were 
conducted using data from high-income coun-
tries and none looked at the effect of alcohol 
prices on smoking onset. More recently, the U.S. 
National Cancer Institute and the World Health 
Organization (2016) concluded that evidence 
was too mixed to make any definitive statement. 
Our results indicate that higher alcohol prices 
increased the hazard of smoking onset, which 
suggests that cigarettes and alcoholic bever-
ages were substitutes. This finding may suggest 
that Argentine youth that were prone to risky 
health behaviors such as drinking and smoking </p>

<p>were more likely to start smoking when the 
price of other risky behaviors such as drinking 
increased. 
This study's contributions are fourfold. First, 
this is just the second exploration of the impact 
of prices on tobacco use that used household-or 
individual-level data in any Latin America coun-
try; and the first that examined smoking onset. 
Using individual data allowed us to examine dif-
ferences in the effect of prices on smoking onset 
across sex and SES. Second, we used a num-
ber of alternative approaches and found that our 
main result that higher tobacco prices decreased 
the hazards of smoking onset was robust to most 
alternative specifications. Third, we explored dif-
ferences in the effect of prices during high and 
low inflation periods and found that prices had no 
effect whatsoever on smoking onset during peri-
ods of hyper-or very high inflation. Fourth, we 
explored the effect of two sets of tobacco control 
policies on smoking onset and considered the role </p>

<p>A. Limitations </p>

<p>First, using cross-sectional self-reported data 
to construct smoking histories may introduce bias 
in the dependent variable (Taurus and Chaloupka 
1999). Although the dataset we constructed is 
retrospective, the relatively young age of respon-
dents likely reduces the possibility of recall bias. 
Moreover, a number of studies have compared 
reconstructed smoking prevalence rates and 
contemporary measured rates and concluded 
that they matched relatively well, especially 
when the focus was on younger populations 
(which is our case) (Kenkel, Lillard, and Mathios 
2004; Christopoulou et al. 2011). Heaping (when 
respondents cannot recall a specific value and 
provide a "prototypical" response near the actual 
value, resulting in the over-representation of 
certain values, such as 15, 18, or 20 years of 
age) can result in a mismatch between our price </p>

<p>variable and our dependent variable, smoking 
onset (Grotpeter 2008; Bar and Lillard 2012). 
Figure 6 presents histograms of age of onset, 
by survey wave. These figures show possible 
heaping at 15, 18, and 20. We re-estimated key 
models with three dummy variables for those 
who started smoking at 15, 18, and 20 and found 
no qualitative differences. Second, the data we 
utilized allowed us to bound the age of onset 
within intervals of 12-24 months. This may 
be problematic in periods of high inflation as 
month-to-month changes in prices can be sub-
stantial. Third, the nature of the data limited our 
ability to include more time-varying individual-
or household-level covariates. For example, we 
were unable to use a time-varying measure of 
household income or even a measure of house-
hold income at time of survey. Although SES is 
inherently time-varying, we used a time-invariant 
measure of SES (educational attainment of the 
household head). Given the relatively young 
age of the respondents in our sample and the </p>

<p>relatively low levels of inter-generational income 
mobility in Argentina, we feel that SES at time 
of survey is a reasonable proxy for SES for 
the time at which individuals were at risk of 
starting smoking. Nevertheless, our SES results 
should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, unlike 
cigarette prices that do not vary between regions 
in Argentina, alcohol prices do vary between 
regions. Consequently, our finding that tobacco 
and alcohol are substitutes should be interpreted 
with caution. </p>

<p>B. Implications for Policy and Research </p>

<p>This study adds to the small but growing body 
of evidence from LMIC that finds that higher 
tobacco prices decrease the hazard of smoking 
onset (Guindon 2014a; Vellios and van Walbeek 
2016; Laxminarayan and Deolalikar 2004). Of 
particular interest is the finding that prices have 
no effect on the hazard of smoking onset in peri-
ods of hyper-and very high inflation. During 
such periods, governments need to be cognizant 
that their most important policy tool to reduce 
tobacco use (i.e., taxes that increase real tobacco 
prices) is likely no longer effective. This finding 
is particularly relevant to Argentina's current sit-
uation, as its government is currently struggling 
to keep inflation under control. It is also rele-
vant to several other LMIC that are experiencing 
high levels of inflation such as Belarus, Malawi, 
Ukraine, and Venezuela (International Monetary 
Fund 2015). At the very least, governments need 
to ensure that specific tobacco taxes are automat-
ically adjusted for changes in overall inflation as 
is the case in Australia and Chile. 
Given that the health benefits of reduced 
cigarette use occur primarily through preventing 
onset or cessation rather than reduced consump-
tion in smokers (Hart, Gruer, and Bauld 2013; 
Pisinger and Godtfredsen 2007) and the lack 
of studies from LMIC, an extension of this 
research that examines the effects of tobacco 
prices on cessation could help fill an important 
evidence gap. </p>
