<p>Abstract. [Purpose] This study was conducted to provide basic data for solutions to reduce the turnover rate of 
physical therapists. It should help create efficient personnel and organization management by exploring the impact 
of the work environment and work-related stress on turnover intention and analyzing the correlation between them. 
[Subjects and Methods] A survey was conducted with 236 physical therapists working at medical institutions in the 
Daejeon and Chungcheong areas. For the analysis on the collected data, correlational and linear regression analy-
ses were conducted using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18.0</rs> program and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. [Results] The results showed 
a statistically significant positive correlation between turnover intention and work-related stress but a statistically 
significant negative correlation respectively between turnover intention and work environment. Work-related stress 
(β=0.415) had a significant positive impact on turnover intention and work environment (β=−0.387) had a signifi-
cant negative impact on turnover intention. [Conclusion] To increase satisfaction level with the profession as well 
as the workplace for physical therapists, improvement of the work environment was the most necessary primary 
improvement. 
Due to the nature of the job, physical therapists provide medical services in close relationships with patients 1, 2) . The 
turnover of physical therapists is a major loss in quality improvement of health services and rehabilitation related to human 
resources 3) . 
Currently, medical services are moving from healthcare provider-centered to patient-centered and hospitals are also con-
verting into patient-centered healthcare systems 4) . In addition, hospital organizations are recognizing recruitment, training, 
and retraining for healthcare providers in each specialized field 5) . 
To provide good quality health services, healthcare providers' beliefs in significantly contributing to patient care and 
their own work satisfaction should be preceded 5) . Emotional labor refers to the idea of suppressing and limiting emotions to 
satisfy hospitals' changing patient-centered goals and patients' feelings 6, 7) . A physical therapist is a representative emotional 
laborer 8) . Stress caused by excessive emotional labor has a negative effect on workers' commitment to the organization and 
satisfaction toward the job 9, 10) , resulting in work-related stress (WS). The work environment (WE) of human service workers 
has also been presented as a major factor in turnovers 11) . 
If an organization member leaves the organization due to turnover, ensuring good quality staffing is threatened; large 
amounts of money are spent in the selection and training of new staff, finally resulting in loss to the organization 12) . Ad-
ditionally, new employees are highly likely to make mistakes or cause accidents compared to employees with experience. </p>

<p>Employee replacement costs are also much higher than the costs of actually recruiting, hiring, and training new staff 12) ; 
therefore, this has negative effects on the overall health and economic sectors. Byun 13) said in her previous research that 
promoting efficient task execution and reducing turnovers by reducing WS and increasing job satisfaction are very important. 
For the efficient management of internal employees, it is necessary to accurately identify job satisfaction and WS and analyze 
their correlations with turnovers. 
Examining similar research on the correlation between a variety of factors in the workplace and turnovers within medical 
institutions, radiological technologists showed higher job satisfaction with higher annual income and lower working years 
and showed higher turnovers depending on the number of working years, wages, and night watch duty 14) . Age, characteristics 
of medical institutions in which they are working, and job satisfaction are related to turnover of occupational therapists 15) . For 
nurses, excellent nursing is dependent on job satisfaction enabling them to handle work positively and efficiently; higher job 
satisfaction reduces turnovers 16) . The reality is that studies related to physical therapists include studies on WS 17) , research 
on working conditions and job satisfaction 18) , empowerment and job satisfaction, research on organizational commitment 19) , 
etc. However, the number is remarkably small compared to studies targeting other health service workers and the data on 
turnover intention (TI) itself as well as studies that analyze the relationship between TI and WE and WS of physical therapists 
are very rare. 
Therefore, by investigating the effect of WS and WE on physical therapists and turnover, this study can provide basic 
data for reducing the turnover of physical therapists and seeking effective human resource and organizational management 
measures in the future. </p>

<p>SUBJECTS AND METHODS </p>

<p>The study participants were 241 physical therapists currently working in medical institutions who were directly visited 
during the three months from January to March 2014 for questionnaire distribution and collection. Five questionnaires were 
miswritten due to error or insufficient survey answer contents; 236 questionnaires were examined statistically. All subjects 
provided written informed consent prior to participation in this study. Those who fully comprehended the study procedure 
and voluntarily agreed to participate were selected as participants. This study was conducted consistent with the principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The TI measurement tool used seven questions; for turnover factors, four questions modified and used by Gang 20) were 
modified and reconstructed for this study. The tool is composed of 11 questions. To measure WS, this study used the question-
naire consisting of 15 questions after modifying and complementing the method used by Byun 13) . The WE measurement tool 
was reconstructed for this study based on the survey tool reconstructed by Lim 21) . WE was measured with a questionnaire 
of 26 questions. Each question on the measurement tool was based on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (strongly agree) 
points and higher scores meant better WE. Cronbach's alpha values in a previous and the present study were more than 0.700. 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">18.0</rs> was used for the collected data and the analysis method is as follows. Participants' general characteristics were 
shown as frequency and percentage. TI, WS, and WE of the participants were obtained as means and standard deviations. The 
data were analyzed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient to verify the reliability of questionnaire internal consistencies. The 
correlation between TI, WS, and WE used correlation analysis through Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression 
analysis to determine the impact of WS and WE on TI 2) . The significance level of this study was set as 0.05. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>The participants' general characteristics are as follows. There were 106 males (44.9%) and 130 females (55.1%). For age, 
155 were less than 30 years old (65.7%) and 81 were older than 30 years (34.3%). Most were single (n=190, 80.5%); 46 were 
married (19.5%). There were 104 college graduates (44.1%), 88 university graduates (37.3%), and 44 graduate students or 
higher (18.6%). Most were hopeful (n=198, 83.9%).This was the first job for 113 (47.9%). In career tenure, 56 had less than 
one year (23.7%), 99 had 1-4 years (41.9%), 42 had 5-9 years (17.8%), and 39 had more than 10 years (16.5%). In current 
hospital tenure, 79 had less than 1 year (33.5%), 125 had 1-3 years (53.0%), and 32 had more than four years (13.6%). 
Sixty people had less than ₩1.5 million monthly income (25.4%), 98 had ₩1.5-2 million (41.5%), 57 had ₩2-2.5 million 
(24.2%), and 21 had more than ₩2.5 million (8.9%). 
The total TI mean of participants was 3.09 ± 0.78; for WS, 3.31 ± 0.56; and for WE, 3.25 ± 0.46. TI and WS (r=0.531, 
p&lt;0.01) had a statistically significant positive correlation and TI and WE (r=−0.511, p&lt;0.01) had a statistically significant 
negative correlation. WS (β=0.415) had a significant positive impact and WE (β=−0.387) had a significant negative impact 
on TI (p&lt;0.01) (Table 1). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>The effects of physical therapy appear through emotional and cognitive interactions in the relationship with patients. 
In this process, emotional labor of a physical therapist affects both the therapist and the patient. However, therapists who 
have previously adapted to the healthcare system have emphasized only ability and have neglected the emotional aspect 22) . </p>

<p>J. Phys. Ther. Sci. Vol. 28, No. 8, 2016 </p>



<p>Accordingly, psychological factors may burden poor WE and reduced job involvement and job satisfaction levels 9, 10) . To 
provide the best care services to patients, physical therapists should continue to have a smooth interactive relationship with 
patients, constantly watch the patient condition, and find the optimum treatment in this process. Thus, physical therapists' 
satisfaction with their job and working with responsibility are essential elements in increasing treatment efficiency as well as 
cementing the relationship with patients 8) . 
In this study, the correlations between TI, WS, and WE were analyzed; there was a statistically significant positive cor-
relation between TI and WS. This was consistent with a study 13) targeting 212 new nurses. TI and WE had a statistically 
significant negative correlation; results of a study 21) targeting 290 nurses support the results of this paper. 
The results of regression analysis on physical therapists' TI by WS showed a positive explanatory power of 41.5% 
(R 2 =0.415); the size of the influence (β=0.415) shows that higher WS leads to relatively higher TI. Lim's study targeting 
248 nursing teachers showed 53.6% explanatory power (R 2 =0.536) and influence of β=0.540; WS also affected TI in other 
occupations, highly supporting the results of this study 19) . However, Heo's study, targeting 353 nurses obtained only 12% 
explanatory power (influence β=0.36) showing relatively low support for the results of this study 24) . On the other hand, 
satisfaction with WE showed a negative explanatory power of 41.5% of TI (R 2 =0.415) and the size of the influence was 
β=−0.387, indicating that low satisfaction with WE leads to relatively high TI. 
Other research results include explanatory power of 52.1% (R 2 =0.521), and influence of β=−0.229 (working environment), 
β=−0.382 (self-development), and β=−0.263 (working facilities) in Lee's study targeting 236 golf course employees 25) ; 
explanatory power of 53.6% (R 2 =0.536) and influence of β=−0.141(relationship with superintendent) and β=−0.118 (com-
pensation adequacy) in Lim's study targeting nursing teachers 21) ; and explanatory power of 36% (R 2 =0.360) and influence of 
β=−0.228 in Sin's study targeting local hospital nurses 23) . Thus, WE affected TI in other occupations, showing high support 
for the results of this study. 
According to the results of this study, the higher the WS, the higher the TI, and the better the WE, the lower the TI. In 
particular, WS had a greater impact on TI than WE. This is similar to the results of Lim 21) and Jeong's 26) studies in which 
WS had the most significant impact on TI. Therefore, WS becomes the direct cause of turnovers and if not solved, leads to 
turnovers. Thus, it is essential to reduce the WS of physical therapists and improve the WE; ways to reduce turnovers should 
be sought through this. 
The limitation of this study is that it cannot be generalized to all physical therapists due to its potential selection bias; 
physical therapists in Daejeon (Chungcheong), physical therapists working in rehabilitation hospitals, and young physical 
therapists were surveyed. Further, the correlations between various stress factors and WE affecting TI could not be clearly 
identified because survey questions were not segmented. In conclusion, future research including national physical therapists, 
all medical institutions, and participants of various ages needs to be conducted. The root cause can be found and solved when 
correlations of each factor are identified more clearly through the segmentation of the survey questions. </p>
