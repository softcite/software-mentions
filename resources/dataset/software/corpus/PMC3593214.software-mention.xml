<p>A pulsed laser engineering approach is developed to prepare novel functional graphene paper with graphitic 
nanospheres homogeneously decorated on the surface and the superior performance of engineered paper is 
revealed in matrix-free mass spectrometry (MS) detection and imaging. We demonstrate that the stability of

<p>G </p>

<p>raphene materials are rapidly attracting interest due to their unique properties and widely spread 
applications 1-4 . With recent advances in nanotechnology, various nano-structured materials have been 
used in irradiation involved area, such as sensitive analysis of molecules 5-7 , including graphene based 
nano-materials 8-15 . Nevertheless, graphene is not stable under strong irradiation conditions 4,16-20 . For example, 
the in situ formation of C 60 on the surface of graphene under 80 keV electron beam irradiation was observed by 
Chuvilin et al. 17 , and carbon clusters with larger sizes (C n , n , 500) were also observed in the mass spectrometry 
(MS) spectra of graphene with high intensity during the laser desorption/ionization (LDI) process 19 , which may 
decrease the detection sensitivity in MS based analysis. Considering the fact that carbon clusters produced from 
graphene during irradiation may have lower atomic energy (,20.26 eV/atom) and thus are more stable com-
pared to graphene 17 , we hypothesise that by introducing stable carbon species homogenously distributed on the 
surface in situ, engineered graphene products can meet the needs of applications designed in extreme conditions, 
e. g. intense irradiation. 
As one of the key fields that require strong (laser) irradiation in nature, MS detection and imaging techniques, 
such as matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS, can help to visualise the spatial distribution of 
molecules without purification, extraction, separation, or labelling of bio-samples, which are important in early 
stage disease diagnosis and forensic applications 21,22 . Despite the substantial progress, the application of MALDI 
MS towards small molecules is limited because the matrices (normally small organo molecules like a-cyano-4-
hydroxycinnamic acid, CHCA) introduce significant background signals during laser ablation in the low molecu-
lar range (,1000 Da). In addition, the large and irregular sizes of the matrix crystals (.10 mm) and sweet-spot 
effects limit the imaging spatial resolution and detection efficiency 5,6 . To date, overcoming the low sensitivity of 
MS based imaging towards small molecules and the preparation of stable functional materials under irradiation 
represent the key challenges to the field. 
To address the above challenges, matrix-free MS techniques have been developed 5-15,23 . Secondary ion MS 
(SIMS) was one of the first matrix-free approaches used to detect and image molecules from biological samples 
using a high-energy primary ion beam to desorb and generate secondary ions from a surface 24,25 . For matrix free 
MS detection and imaging applications, an ideal substrate should have the following attributes: (1) stable with 
minimum matrix interference; (2) able to provide sufficient surface area and desirable interaction with analyte 
molecules; (3) electric conductive with high electron mobility and efficient in laser absorbance for desorption/ 
ionization; and (4) homogeneous in surface for reproducibility and faithful replication of imaging 5,6,18 . However, 
currently used substrates are far from ideal and new materials with improved performance are in urgent demand. 
Recently it was found that the functional sites on engineered graphene induced by laser irradiation could be 
utilized for enhanced electric capacitance 2,3 . In this study, we demonstrate that the stability of graphene paper </p>

<p>during intense laser irradiation can be dramatically increased 
through a pulsed-laser engineering process by forming densely 
packed graphitic nanospheres (stable under 300 keV electron beam) 
on the paper surface. Moreover, the surface hydrophobicity is 
enhanced and the electric conductivity is improved. The engineered 
graphene paper as a substrate for matrix-free LDI MS detection and 
imaging helps recognize invisible stamped micro-patterns, increas-
ing the detection limit towards diverse molecules by over two orders 
of magnitude compared to the pristine graphene paper and commer-
cial products. To our knowledge, the laser engineering approach 
represents a novel strategy compared to previous reports where the 
laser treatment was used either in a different manner or for other 
applications (see Table S1 for more details). </p>

<p>Results 
The graphene sheets prepared by chemical reduction of graphene 
oxide were utilised as the precursor (Figure S1). The graphene paper 
was obtained by vacuum filtration of the as-synthesised graphene 
suspension (Figure 1a and 1b). A pulsed nitrogen laser with a wave-
length of 337 nm was employed to engineer the graphene paper 
(Figure 1c). The laser beam scanning (,30 mm in spot diameter, 
500 pulses for each spot) was programmed with the spot-to-spot 
distance of 30 mm in two dimensions to ensure the maximum and 
homogenous modification on the surface, which is also sufficient for 
the identification of latent fingerprints with a typical spatial resolu-
tion of 150 mm 22 . The laser energy was approximately 121.8 mJ for 
100% laser intensity, which was adjusted to be 10%, 30% and 50% to 
study its influence on the structure and performance of engineered 
graphene papers (graphene paper was damaged by severe fragmenta-
tion at 80% intensity, data not shown). As shown in the digital image 
(Figure 1d), the engineered area of the graphene paper turns to dark 
black after laser treatment with 50% laser intensity. The engineered 
graphene paper is freestanding and highly flexible, which can be bent 
and twisted into large angles without breaking as displayed in the 
inset of Figure 1e. Consequently, the engineered graphene paper 
(1.5 cm 3 0.75 cm) can be easily integrated on the top of a glass 
slide (Figure 1e) and used as a substrate for MS detection and 
imaging applications (Figure 1f). </p>

<p>The morphology of the engineered graphene paper was investi-
gated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 1d shows the 
typical SEM images of graphene paper before and after laser treat-
ment with 50% laser intensity. The pristine graphene paper shows a 
relatively smooth surface. In contrast, the engineered graphene paper 
possesses a very rough surface with ordered concaves and convexes. 
The periodic concaves have a uniform distance of ,30 mm, consist-
ent with the spot size of the laser beam. Such a rough surface may be 
responsible for enhanced light absorbance and diffuse reflection, lead-
ing to the dark colour of the engineered graphene paper. The contact 
angle (CA) of graphene paper was measured (inset of Figure 1d) and 
used as the quantitative indicator of changing surface hydrophobicity. 
The CA of the untreated graphene paper is 30u, which increases 
dramatically to 131u for the engineered paper, indicative of enhanced 
surface hydrophobicity. Due to the high surface tension, a water 
droplet tends to minimize the surface. Although the surface of a 
hydrophobic substrate is covered with an aqueous solution, the area 
between ridges on the rough surface may not be filled by the liquid, 
leading to the formation of a composite interface. As a result, air 
bubbles are entrapped into micro-/nano-sized pores at the solid sur-
face, where a mix of solid-liquid and solid-gas interfaces is created. 
Compared to the plain graphene paper, engineered graphene paper 
with enhanced surface roughness increases the volume of air bubbles 
entrapped in the interface and the extent of solid-gas interface is 
proportional to the degree of hydrophobicity of the material 26-28 . 
Meanwhile, after the laser treatment, the electrical resistance of the 
paper is reduced from 1.5 to 0.3 kV/cm. The enhanced electrical 
conductivity is attributed to the elimination of oxygen atoms caused 
by the laser irradiation process (the oxygen atomic content reduced 
from 19.5% to 14.1% after laser treatment according to the X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy in Figure S2), a phenomenon consistent 
with previous literatures 2,3 . The changes in surface chemistry and the 
introduction of surface roughness at the micro-/nano-scale (see also 
details in Figure 2) by the laser irradiation may both contribute to the 
enhanced hydrophobicity of engineered graphene papers. 
To clarify the effects of laser irradiation intensity, a series of testing 
samples were prepared under different laser intensities (0%, 10%, 30% 
and 50%). For the untreated graphene paper (Figure 2a and 2e), the </p>

graphene sheets are stacked horizontally with very few minor wrinkles 
found on the surface. Under mild laser irradiation (laser intensity of 
10%), the loosely packed graphene sheets on the paper surface begin 
to peel off and the edges of the exfoliated graphene sheets are exposed 
to the surface (Figure 2b and 2f). At a laser intensity of 30%, the 
surface of the paper is dominated by the edges of graphene sheets, 
indicating that the graphene sheets are no longer parallel to the paper 
plane (Figure 2c). The ordered array of concaves and convexes can be 
formed when the laser intensity is reached to 50% (Figure 2d). The 
morphology of graphene paper under different laser intensity can also 
be observed in a large scale under lower magnification SEM images as 
displayed in Figure S3. 
Under higher magnification (Figure 2g), nanospheres with sizes of 
20-80 nm are observed at the edges of the exfoliated graphene sheets. 
Further increase of the laser intensity to 50% (Figure 2d, 2h and 3a) 
leads to the formation of nanospheres arrays on the surface. The 
surface of the engineered area is fully decorated with aligned nano-
spheres, which is different from the morphology of laser-engineered 
graphene with exfoliated layers described in the previous litera-
tures 2,3 . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also used to </p>

<p>investigate the structure of nanospheres, where densely stacked 
spherical structures can be found on the edge of engineered graphene 
(Figure 3b). The typical graphitic interlayer spacings (,0.35 nm) 
can be clearly observed in the shell (inset of Figure 3b). It was 
reported that graphene was not stable under electron beam at an 
acceleration voltage of 80 kV 16,17 . In our experiments, it was noticed 
that the carbon nanospheres formed on the graphene surface main-
tained a stable structure under 300 keV electron beam, indicating 
enhanced stability over bare graphene paper. The engineered paper 
keeps its unique surface morphology even after sonication (Figure 
S4a), indicating that the in situ grown nanospheres attach firmly to 
the surface (Figure S4b) and the engineered paper is robust for fur-
ther applications. The carefully chosen laser engineering parameters 
in our experiments, including the spot size and spot-spot distance, 
multiple shots (500) on one spot, high energy laser with a short 
wavelength with optimised intensity, all favour a fully functionalised, 
stable and homogenous surface. 
The stability of the pristine and engineered graphene papers was 
examined under LDI MS. As shown in Figure 2i and 2j, both the 
untreated and mildly engineered (with 10% laser intensity) graphene </p>

papers produced a large number of fragments from the carbon clus-
ters with signal intensity up to 75,000. In the case of engineered paper 
with 30% laser intensity (Figure 2k), the fragments can still be 
observed but with a decreased signal intensity (12,000). The engi-
neered paper with 50% laser intensity produces fragments with sig-
nificantly lower signal intensity (, 2,000, Figure 2l). We conclude 
that the engineered graphene paper has enhanced stability against 
fragmentation under laser irradiation compared to the pristine paper 
by at least two orders of magnitude. 
To investigate the origin of the enhanced stability of engineered 
paper against fragmentation, Raman spectrometry was employed. 
As shown in Figure 2m-p, all the graphene papers show char-
acteristic peaks for the D, G bands. The I(D)/I(G) ratio is 1.42 for 
the pristine graphene paper (Figure 2m), which slightly increases 
to 1.62 (Figure 2n) after irradiated with laser intensity of 10%. The 
stacked graphene sheets in the pristine paper are slightly damaged 
and exfoliated (Figure 2b and 2f); as a result, more lattice defects 
are created and more dangling bonds are exposed, leading to a 
higher I(D)/I(G) ratio 29,30 . When the laser intensity is increased to 
30% and 50%, the I(D)/I(G) ratio is reduced to 0.99 and 0.81, 
respectively (Figure 2o and 2p), suggesting that the number of 
lattice defects is decreased with the increase in irradiation energy. 
It has been reported that carbon atoms at the defect sites are less 
stable than those located at regular carbon positions 14,15 . With the </p>

<p>reduction in the number of defect carbon atoms and the forma-
tion of nanospheres with the increased laser intensity, the stability 
of engineered graphene paper against further fragmentation can 
be enhanced. 
Taking the advantages of the enhanced stability, hydrophobicity 
and conductivity, the graphene paper engineered at 50% laser intens-
ity was employed as a substrate for matrix-free MS detection and 
imaging applications. The performance of the engineered graphene 
paper is compared with a commercial product, NALDI TM plate 
(Bruker) 23 , for matrix free MS analysis of a small dye molecule acrid-
ine orange 10-nonyl bromide (AONB). In the case of the NALDI TM 
plate, only weak signals of AONB (8.5 fmol) at m/z of 392 
[C 26 H 38 BrN 3 -Br] 1 were observed with signal strength less than 
1000 (Figure 4a), whereas on the engineered graphene paper the 
molecular ion peak was observed with signal strength over 100,000 
(Figure 4b), ,100 times stronger compared with that observed on 
the commercial plate. When the amount of AONB is decreased to 
less than 1 fmol (0.85 fmol), the analyte signal failed to be identified 
on the commercial NALDI TM plate (Figure S5a), but was clearly 
observed on the engineered graphene paper (Figure S5b). It is noted 
that in control experiments with CHCA used as matrix, weak signals 
of AONB (8.5 fmol, Figure S6a) can be viewed in the presence of 
strong CHCA interference peaks and detection fails with decreased 
AONB amount (0.85 fmol, Figure S6b). It is concluded that the 
engineered graphene paper has superior performance compared to 
the commercial product for advanced matrix-free MS applications. 
The potential of engineered graphene paper was further demon-
strated in MS detection and imaging of lipid molecules. Figure 3c &amp; d 
showed the MS spectra of a lipid molecule, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)-
propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP), on un-
modified and engineered graphene paper, respectively. In the case 
of unmodified graphene paper, the signals from DOTAP cannot be 
identified due to the strong background noise (Figure 4c). In con-
trast, the background noise is significantly reduced in the case of the 
engineered paper, and two peaks with strong intensity at m/z of 662 
([C 42 H 80 NO 4 ] 1 ) and 380 ([C 42 H 80 NO 4 -C 18 H 33 O 2 ] 1 ) are observed 
(Figure 4d). The DOTAP signal can be detected on the engineered 
paper at 30 fmol lipids (Figure S7). For comparison, the matrix-
assisted approach using CHCA yields very strong background signals 
in the spectrum due to matrix fragmentation and can not identify the 
lipid at low concentrations (see Figure S6c, d). The engineered gra-
phene paper was also successfully applied to the matrix-free detec-
tion of two phosphorous lipids (dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline, 
DPPC, and hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine, HSPC) and the 
detection of limit reached femtomolar level (Figure S8). The detec-
tion of lipids on the engineered graphene paper shows an increase of 
,1000 fold, compared to literature reports using graphene based 
devices (,nmol) 11 . The above results demonstrate the remarkable 
ionization/detection performance of engineered graphene paper 
towards various lipid molecules. 
To show the matrix-free MS imaging capability of the engi-
neered graphene paper, a stamp was made by laser engraving 
several letters, where the finest width of letter strokes, e.g., N, is 
,150 mm, similar to the typical spatial resolution of a fingerprint. 
A dilute solution of DOTAP (1.4 pmol/mL) was used as invisible 
'ink' for stamping. The stamp was dipped into the solution and 
then pressed onto the graphene paper to mark the pattern of 
letters, which is invisible on the stamped paper (Figure S9) and 
can only be subsequently constructed by 2D matrix-free MS 
imaging technique (see Methods for details). As indicated in 
Figure 3d, the signals of DOTAP at m/z of 662 and 380 are 
monitored and shown in red and green, respectively. The pixel 
size is 50 mm by 50 mm to distinguish the finest width of letters in 
the stamp. In the case of un-modified graphene paper, the pattern 
of stamp is non-resolved and difficult to fully image ('N' in 
Figure 4e &amp; f, 'A' and 'B' in Figure S10a, b, e, f). In contrast, </p>

<p>
when the engineered graphene paper is used as the substrate, the 
pattern of the letters is clear and fully resolved (Figure 4g &amp; h, 
Figure S10c, d, g, h). It is noted that due to the low concentration 
(,pmol/mL) and detection of limit (,fmol) for detection and 
imaging achieved in our study, the engineered graphene paper 
can be applied not only with tissue blotting for small metabolites 
and lipids molecules 8,22-25 , but also used in the forensic study to 
track trace amount of chemicals (normal concentration ,nmol/ 
mL, such as drugs) in the latent fingerprint 1,2,9 and record/monitor 
the invisible micro-pattern of specific molecules. </p>

<p>Discussion 
The high performance in matrix-free MS detection and imaging 
applications can be attributed to the unique structural features of 
the engineered graphene paper and the improved LDI efficiency of 
the analytes. The enhanced stability of engineered graphene paper 
due to decreased defects and the formation of stable graphitic nano-
sphere arrays effectively prevent the substrate material from </p>

<p>unwanted fragmentation and laser energy loss, leading to the ultra-
high ionization/detection efficiency and improved detection sens-
itivity. Meanwhile, the enhanced surface hydrophobicity can provide 
strengthened hydrophobic interaction with hydrophobic analyte 
molecules (such as lipids in our case), favourable for the laser energy 
transfer to the lipid molecules and for laser induced desorption pro-
cess 18,31 . The improved electrical conductivity is also beneficial dur-
ing the LDI process, providing improved electron mobility on the 
substrate surface for better analyte ionization. Most importantly, the 
carefully adjusted laser engineering parameters create a homogen-
eous functional surface, which is crucial for the reliable and high-
resolution replication of invisible micro-pattern of low concentration 
analytes. 
In conclusion, we have successfully developed a pulsed laser 
engineering method to prepare functional graphene-based papers, 
which have enhanced stability and superior performance in matrix-
free MS detection and imaging of a variety of small molecules com-
pared to expensive commercial products. Our contribution is not </p>

tial in diverse applications such as diagnostics, biomarker discovery, 
and forensic applications. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Engineering the graphene paper and characterization. In the laser engineering of 
the obtained graphene paper, the pulsed nitrogen laser with wavelength of 337 nm 
(200 Hz) was used in the Bruker Autoflex III MS chamber and the paper was loaded 
on the MALDI plate for further engineering. The imaging mode was employed for the 
laser engineering, where the spot-to-spot distance is set to be 30 mm and 500 shots 
were taken at each spot. The laser power was about 121.8 mJ for 100% laser intensity 14 . 
The laser intensity was set to be 10%, 30% and 50% to get different engineered 
graphene paper. The engineered paper was tailored into different shapes for mass 
spectrometry detection and imaging. The SEM images were taken on the JSM-7800F 
Thermal Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope, the samples were loaded on 
the carbon adhesive and baked overnight at 70uC before SEM analysis without 
coating of gold or platinum. Contact angle measurement was performed by 
Dataphysics OCA 20-sessible/pendant drop measurement, where 5 mL of water 
droplet was placed on the substrate paper. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis 
was performed on the Kratos Axis Ultra photoelectron spectrometer which used Al 
K a (1253.6 eV) X-rays. The electrical resistance of paper was measured using the 
CM2700 device from the CALTEK instrument. TEM images were taken with a JEOL 
2011 microscope operated at 300 kV. The LDI MS spectra of the paper were collected 
at the laser intensity of 36%, where 500 shoots were taken at 10 spots (50 shots for each 
spot). The Raman spectra were recorded using 514 nm laser on the Renishaw inVia 
Raman spectrometer, where mild laser intensity (10%) was used to avoid the further 
damage to the samples. </p>

<p>Matrix-free LDI MS detection and imaging. The lipid molecules were initially 
dissolved in chloroform and ethanol was used for AONB at a concentration of 1 mg/ 
mL and then diluted in a step wise manner. To perform to MS detection, typically 
0.4 mL of the diluted solution was directly deposited on the paper or NALDI TM plate 
(Bruker Daltonics), for MS analysis on Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III Smartbeam. For 
the standard matrix assisted detection, 0.4 mL of sample solution was mixed with 1 mL 
of CHCA matrix (10 mg/mL, in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid, 
50549.950.1%, v/v/v) and dried on the commercial MALDI plate (MPT 384 plain 
steel) before MS analysis. All mass spectra were obtained in the RP-HPC-Proteomics 
mode via an accumulation of 500 laser shots under a laser intensity of 36% for data 
collection and calibrated using an auto calibration method. Two standard peptides, 
Angiotensin II (M.W. 1046.5) and ACTH-Clip (M.W. 2465.7), were used for 
calibration to reduce variability. No smoothing of spectra was applied. In the imaging 
experiments, the stamp with laser engraved letters pattern was first fabricated and 
immersed into a DOTAP solution at a concentration of 1 ng/mL. The stamp was 
pressed to the paper substrate separately and then the stamped paper was loaded into 
the MS chamber for imaging. Matrix-free mass spectrometry imaging was performed 
on the Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III mass analyzer system in positive reflector mode. 
In the imaging set up, the spot-to-spot distance was set to be 50 mm and 50 laser shots 
were taken with laser intensity of 36% at each spot. The nitrogen laser (337 nm) was 
applied at a repetition rate of 200 Hz. A full mass spectrum ranging from 200 to 
2000 m/z was acquired for every pixel at an x-y step-size of 50 mm. Imaging data was 
stored in the FlexImaging data format (Bruker Bioscience). <rs type="software">2D image construction 
and statistical analysis were executed using custom-made scripts in the FlexImaging 
software (Bruker Biosicence, AUS</rs>). Peak finding and integration was performed for 
each pixel to select peaks at specific m/z of 380 and 662. Peaks were integrated using a 
0.3 Da window.
