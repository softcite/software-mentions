<p>rotein-coding and non-coding RNA 
transcripts perform a wide variety of 
cellular functions in diverse organisms. 
Several of their functional roles are 
expressed and modulated via RNA struc-
ture. A given transcript, however, can 
have more than a single functional RNA 
structure throughout its life, a fact 
which has been previously overlooked. 
Transient RNA structures, for example, 
are only present during specific time 
intervals and cellular conditions. We 
here introduce four RNA families with 
transient RNA structures that play dis-
tinct and diverse functional roles. More-
over, we show that these transient RNA 
structures are structurally well-defined 
and evolutionarily conserved. Since 
RFAM annotates one structure for each 
family, there is either no annotation for 
these transient structures or no such 
family. Thus, our alignments either sig-
nificantly update and extend the existing 
RFAM families or introduce a new RNA 
family to RFAM. For each of the four 
RNA families, we compile a multiple-
sequence alignment based on experimen-
tally verified transient and dominant 
(dominant in terms of either the ther-
modynamic stability and/or attention 
received so far) RNA secondary struc-
tures using a combination of automated 
search via covariance model and manual 
curation. The first alignment is the Trp 
operon leader which regulates the 
operon transcription in response to tryp-
tophan abundance through alternative 
structures. The second alignment is the 
HDV ribozyme which we extend to the 
5 
0 flanking sequence. This flanking 
sequence is involved in the regulation of 
the transcript's self-cleavage activity. 
The third alignment is the 5 
0 UTR of 
the maturation protein from Levivirus </p>

<p>which contains a transient structure that 
temporarily postpones the formation of 
the final inhibitory structure to allow 
translation of maturation protein. The 
fourth and last alignment is the SAM 
riboswitch which regulates the down-
stream gene expression by assuming 
alternative structures upon binding of 
SAM. All transient and dominant struc-
tures are mapped to our new alignments 
introduced here. </p>

<p>Living 
organisms 
either 
have 
genomes that express RNA sequences as 
their primary products or genomes 
made of RNA. Understanding how 
RNA molecules convey a multitude of 
functional roles is thus key to under-
standing life. RNA molecules have the 
remarkable ability to form RNA struc-
tures which is one key mechanism for 
assigning a functional role to an RNA. 
These RNA structures and the func-
tional roles they play, for example in 
regulating the transcription and transla-
tion of eukaryotic genes, have been the 
subject of intense study for several deca-
des. Databases such as RFAM 
1 provide a 
catalogue of RNA families and the cor-
responding key RNA secondary-struc-
ture features across a range of 
evolutionarily related organisms. This 
has, for example, helped to automati-
cally search newly sequenced genomes 
for members of known RNA families. </p>

<p>RNA FAMILY </p>

<p>techniques, it transpires that the tran-
scriptomes of many organisms, includ-
ing the human, are much more 
complex than initially thought. Several 
studies have discovered RNA molecules 
with multiple structures which each 
plays a distinct functional role at differ-
ent times of the molecule's life. One 
early example of sequences with more 
than one functional RNA structure is 
so-called riboswitch 
2-4 which consists of 
two distinct, mutually exclusive RNA 
structures each with a distinct func-
tional role. We thus need to start look-
ing beyond the one-sequence-one-
structure dogma to appreciate that one 
RNA sequence can have more than one 
functional structure throughout its cel-
lular life and to understand the mecha-
nisms underlying their regulation. 
We know by now that RNA structure 
formation in vivo involves transient RNA 
structure elements which can not only 
help to define co-transcriptional folding 
pathways, but can also play distinct func-
tional roles of their own. 
5 These transient 
structures can, for example, aid the correct 
formation of long range interaction (LRI), 
as seen in Bacterial RNase P Type A RNA 
and Bacterial SRP 4.5S RNA where the 
transient structures are formed preceding 
a transcriptional pausing site to sequester 
the 5' portion of a LRI until the cognate 
3' portion is synthesised. 
6 Moreover, 
such transient structures can be employed 
to regulate gene expression either via 
translational control as exemplified in 
Levivirus 
7,8 or via a transcriptional mech-
anism as exhibited by Tryptophan operon 
leader 
9,10 and SAM riboswitch. 
11 Last 
but not the least, transient structures 
incorporating the 5' flanking sequence 
are involved in adjusting the self-cleavage 
activity of HDV ribozyme, CPEB3 ribo-
zyme and group I intron. </p>

<p>12,13 </p>

<p>Recent statistical evidence suggests that 
some transient structures are evolution-
arily conserved across homologous 
sequences thus confirming their potential 
functional importance. 
14 It is thus possi-
ble to provide entries in RFAM with a more 
complete structural annotation which 
should in turn allow us to gain a better 
understanding of the underlying regula-
tory mechanisms. </p>

<p>Purpose 
For each of the four alignments intro-
duced in this study, evidence from previ-
ous studies (as cited in each individual 
section below) shows that the formation 
of the experimentally confirmed transient/ 
alternative structures is critical to confer to 
the RNA molecule the ability to modulate 
gene expression or regulate ribozyme activ-
ity. Moreover, our previous research </p>

<p>14 </p>

<p>shows that the computationally predicted 
co-transcriptional folding pathways for 
homologous RNA sequences go through 
similar transient structural configurations, 
thus supporting our hypothesis that evolu-
tionarily related RNA sequences co-tran-
scriptionally fold in similar ways whose 
features have been partly conserved. Over-
all, the functional and structural annota-
tion of any RNA family should thus 
naturally include any conserved transient 
and alternative strutures with functional 
roles. Right now, however, RFAM 
1 only 
specifies a single functional structure for 
each RNA family. The RFAM database of 
RNA families 
1 features three of them -
Trp operon leader (RF00513), HDV ribo-
zyme (RF00094), SAM riboswitch 
(RF00162) -but lacks the annotation and 
alignment for the alternative structures. 
More specifically, RFAM features the termi-
nator structure of Trp operon leader, but 
misses the anti-terminator structure; for 
HDV ribozyme, the active self-cleavage 
structure is included, but the repressive 
and permissive structures involving the 5' 
flanking sequence of the cleavage site are 
missing; for the SAM riboswitch, though 
most of the SAM-bound structure is 
included, the corresponding alignment 
and annotation for the terminator hairpin 
and the SAM-unbound structure are 
absent. The Levivirus family is completely 
new and not yet part of RFAM. In order to 
provide more complete structural annota-
tions including conserved transient and 
alternative structures, we set up a pipeline 
involving INFERNAL program 
92 to structur-
ally align sequences for multiple structures. 
We here show that it is possible to go 
beyond the one-sequence-one-structure 
dogma by providing carefully curated 
alignment annotated by both transient/ 
alternative and dominant structures for the 
four RNA alignments (section 1 of </p>

<p>Supplementary Material contains the 
alignments, CM files and initial struc-
tures/sequence identified from literature). </p>

<p>Trp Operon Leader </p>

<p>Transcriptional control 
of the tryptophan operon 
Layout of the functional domains in trp 
operon 
The E.coli trp operon spans approxi-
mately 7000 nucleotides (nt) which con-
secutively encode the promoter containing 
an operator, 
15,16 the transcribed leader 
region, and structural genes essential for 
the biosynthesis of tryptophan(trp), i.e. E, 
D, C, B, A. 
17 The leader transcript refers 
to the 162 nt long untranslated region 
(UTR) preceding the structural genes. </p>

<p>10 </p>

<p>Along this leader transcript, the ribo-
somal binding site resides at the 5' end, </p>

<p>18 </p>

<p>and an internal transcription termination 
signal is located distally before the first 
structural gene E. 
10,19 This termination 
signal, lying within the attenuator, can be 
recognised by RNA polymerase to pro-
duce a transcript of about 140 nt (137-
141) length. 
9.20 This shorter transcript 
generates a leader peptide consisting of 
14 residues whose distal end has a tan-
dem of trp residues. 
10 This leader peptide 
is involved in the attenuation regulatory 
strategy where the Trp operon leader is 
utilised for adaptation to the metabolic 
condition concerning the biosynthesis of 
trp. </p>

<p>9 </p>

<p>Attenuation in Tryptophan operon leader 
The trp-activated repressor protein 
(trpR) is stimulated upon trp binding to 
compete against RNA polymerase, 
21 and 
consequently switches off the initiation of 
trp operon transcription. 
22 An additional 
repression mechanism is postulated to 
operate directly on the progressing tran-
scription along the starting segment of the 
operon. 
23,24 Further deletion mutagenesis 
studies narrow down the regulatory region 
onto the leader region of the trp 
operon 
25,26 wherein transcription stops at 
a distal transcription termination site. </p>

<p>19,27 </p>

<p>The transcription and translation of this 
short leader transcript have been demon-
strated in vivo and in vitro. 
9,28,29 The </p>

<p>6 
Volume 12 Issue 1 
RNA Biology </p>

<p>corresponding leader peptide is the 
byproduct of the attenuation mechanism 
which is essentially an internal transcrip-
tion termination signal that is modulated 
in response to the abundance of metabo-
lites relevant to the products of this 
operon. 
25 Consequently, the ongoing 
transcription of the downstream operon 
genes could be regulated accordingly and 
promptly in an "economical" way. </p>

<p>9,25 </p>

<p>The attenuation mechanism requires 
the translation of the leader peptide as 
shown by the altered termination fre-
quency observed in mutants with deficient 
components or targets of the translation 
machinery, e.g., tRNA, tryptophanyl-
tRNA 
synthetase 
and 
start 
codon. 
10,18,30,31 Whether the ribosome 
stalls during translation and where this 
occurs is likely to influence this regulatory 
attenuation mechanism because it depends 
on the abundance of the corresponding 
loaded tRNA; given the trailing trp tan-
dem observed in this trp operon, the trp 
codon is found to be the codon </p>

<p>responsible for this. 
10,32 Where the ribo-
some stalls dictates which alternative RNA 
structure the leader transcript forms: 
either the transcription termination hair-
pin forms or it is disrupted to permit tran-
scriptional read-through. 
30 In essence, the 
choice between terminator and anti-termi-
nator structures bridges the communica-
tion between the translation of the leader 
peptide and the transcription of operon 
genes in exchanging the message for the 
abundance of trp. </p>

<p>10,33 </p>

<p>Dual regulatory systems for the operon 
expression 
When trp is abundant, the cell uses a 
repressive system to promote the synthesis 
of other amino acids in starvation; here, 
the trpR repressor operates on the tran-
scription initiation whereas the attenua-
tion operates on the progressing 
transcription. 
10 The repression system tar-
gets the intracellular trp concentration 
which depends on the influx trp, the 
newly synthesised trp, and finally the </p>

<p>consumption of trp for protein synthe-
sis. 
10 In contrast, the attenuation measures 
the concentration of charged tRNA 
Trp , 
which is contributed by cellular capability 
of protein synthesis, trp concentration, 
tryptophanyl-tRNA 
synthetase, 
and 
tRNA 
Trp . 
10 The intracellular trp concen-
tration does not always correlate with the 
concentration of charged tRNA 
Trp . 
9 This 
dual system thus acts in concert to tune 
the biosynthesis level of trp on a wide 
spectrum. </p>

<p>10,34 </p>

<p>Terminator Structure 
The terminator structure consists of two 
hairpins 
The 5' portion of the first hairpin 
encompasses the region encoding the trail-
ing residues of the leader peptide: Trp, 
Trp, Arg, Thr, Ser 
10 (Figure 1). Other 
than the trp tandem required for sensing 
trp deficiency, base pairs embedded in this 
region also impose constraints on the 
sequence 
composition; 
indeed, </p>

<p>Figure 1. Schematic drawing for Tryptophan operon leader. The Trp codon (W) tandem is highlighted in green color in both the gene structure (the leader 
peptide sequence is shown) and the RNA secondary structures. The stem of the termination hairpin is colored in red in both terminator and anti-termina-
tor structures. In the anti-terminator structure, the ribosome, stalling on the Trp tandem, impedes the formation of the first hairpin. The 5' portion (red) of 
the termination hairpin is then sequestered in an anti-terminator hairpin. The RNA secondary structures in Figures 1-4 are drawn via VARNA[98]. </p>

<p>www.tandfonline.com

RNA Biology </p>

<p>conservation is observed in these five suc-
cessive codons and mutating the upstream 
codons does not alter the operon expres-
sion. </p>

<p>9,10,35-37 </p>

<p>The second hairpin, 
enriched in G/C and immediately fol-
lowed by several uracil residues, comprises 
the termination signal that attenuates the 
operon transcription. </p>

<p>10,20 </p>

<p>The terminator structure forms when 
no ribosome stalls in the vicinity of the Trp 
tandem (i.e., Trp or Arg codon); that is, 
either the leader peptide is not translated 
or the translation proceeds smoothly along 
the 5 
0 portion of the first hairpin with 
abundant charged tRNA </p>

<p>Trp </p>

<p>. 
9,10 More spe-
cifically, the ribosome is proposed to steri-
cally mask about 10 nts downstream, thus 
ribosome stalling in either the upstream 
Gly or further downstream Thr does not 
disrupt the formation of the termination 
hairpin. 
9,10 Thereafter, co-transcriptional 
folding only allows the two hairpins to 
form sequentially; the first hairpin forms 
right after its pairing portions are tran-
scribed, rendering the 3 
0 portion of the first 
hairpin unavailable to pair with the newly 
synthesised 5 
0 half of the second termina-
tion hairpin. </p>

<p>10 </p>

<p>Experimental evidence. In the past, the 
terminator structure responsible for pro-
ducing the 140 nt-long attenuated leader 
transcript has been investigated via experi-
mental approaches. Lee and Yanofsky 
(1977) concluded that the termination 
efficiency at the attenuator is correlated 
with the stability of an embedded second-
ary structure which is conserved between 
E. coli and Salmonnella typhimurium; the 
proposed structures agree with results of a 
partial RNase T1 digestion that exhibit 
digestion resistance in the distal portion of 
this transcript, i.e., where the structural 
features are located. </p>

<p>32 </p>

<p>Thereafter, 
Oxender et al. (1979) conducted struc-
tural probing with RNase T1 partial 
digestion followed by isolation of the co-
migrating pairing regions in a non-dena-
turing gel electrophoresis; the base-pairing 
regions were subsequently identified via 
denaturing gel electrophoresis and finger-
printing, based on which the two hairpins 
comprising the terminator structure were 
drawn. 
33 Later on, the secondary structure 
of DNA template was ruled out as a con-
tributor for this termination signal so the 
RNA structural features are the one </p>

<p>causing the termination. 
9,38,39 Indeed, the 
functional importance of the second hair-
pin for the transcriptional termination is 
illustrated by the reduced transcription 
termination frequency observed in experi-
ments destabilising the central GCC pair-
ing of this hairpin, such as by in vivo 
mutational analysis or in vitro substitution 
of G-C bond by I-C bond. 
32,40-42 More-
over, mutational analysis progressively dis-
rupting the first hairpin still preserves the 
production of the attenuated transcript, 
suggesting that the second hairpin itself is 
sufficient for the termination. </p>

<p>9,42 </p>

<p>Anti-terminator structure 
Anti-terminator structure disrupts the 
two terminator hairpins 
The anti-terminator hairpin is formed 
by the pairing between the 3 
0 portion of 
the first hairpin and the 5 
0 portion of the 
second hairpin from the terminator 
structure. </p>

<p>10 </p>

<p>This structure occurs when charged 
tRNA 
Trp (or tRNA 
Arg ) is starving, and the 
ribosome is impeded around the tandem 
Trp codon where the 5 
0 portion of the first 
terminator hairpin resides. 
10 This stalling 
ribosome spans approximately 10 nucleo-
tides downstream and thereby prevents 
the formation of the first terminator hair-
pin. 
10 Instead, it promotes the base-pair-
ing between the 3 
0 half of the first 
terminator hairpin and the 5 
0 half of the 
second terminator hairpin once they are 
transcribed. 
10 Co-transcriptionally, this 
removes the pairing option held by the 3 </p>

<p>0 </p>

<p>of the second terminator hairpin, render-
ing it single-stranded. 
10 Since the tran-
scriptional termination hairpin is 
sequestered under this circumstance, the 
progressing RNA polymerase no longer 
dissociates at the attenuation site, and the 
mRNA encoding the trp operon poly-pep-
tides gets fully transcribed. 
9,10 Nonethe-
less, the anti-terminator hairpin is 
speculated to still form occasionally after 
the ribosome dissociates from the leader 
transcript even in the absence of ribosome 
stalling. </p>

<p>9 </p>

<p>Experimental evidence 
Both the translation of the leader pep-
tide and ribosomal stalling are necessary 
for 
inhibiting 
the 
transcription </p>

<p>termination. </p>

<p>31 </p>

<p>Moreover, mutational 
analysis destabilising or disrupting the 
base-pairing of the anti-terminator hair-
pin, e.g., trpL75 mutant, demonstrates 
increased termination of several folds; 
consistent with the attenuation model, 
this mutation prevents the relief of attenu-
ation even with Trp starvation. 
9,31 In con-
trast, complementary oligonucleotides 
targeting the 5 
0 portion of the first termi-
nator hairpin increase the operon expres-
sion, presumably promoting the anti-
terminator formation. 
9,43 However, there 
is no direct experimental evidence con-
firming the base-pairing of the anti-termi-
nator hairpin (i.e., structural probing) due 
to the co-transcriptional nature, i.e. the 
other two terminator hairpins render the 
anti-terminator formation infeasible. </p>

<p>9 </p>

<p>Half-life of the structures 
The formation of the alternative struc-
tures is determined by whether or not the 
translating ribosome is impeded, which 
must be concomitantly captured by the 
transcribing polymerase. 
9 The time scale 
of the structural modulation must thus be 
comparable to that of the transcribing 
polymerase. 
10 Evidence supporting this 
requirement is a transcriptional pausing 
site located at the end of the first termina-
tor hairpin which allows time to put the 
ribosome in sync with the RNA polymer-
ase along the same transcript. 
10 The 
amount of trp abundance can thus be mea-
sured in a timely manner via the proper 
formation of the alternative structure. Sub-
sequently, either attenuation or read-
through occurs accordingly. </p>

<p>Translational control

Levivirus 
Phylogeny and host specificity of family 
Leviviridae 
The family Leviviridae, a prevalent 
family targeting gram-negative bacteria, 
comprises positive single-stranded (ss) 
RNA bacteriophages with one of the 
smallest genome sizes (around 3500 to 
4200 nt). 
44-47 Most of the family mem-
bers exhibit infection specificity for E. coli 
bearing F pilus receptors; moreover, the </p>

<p> 
Volume 12 Issue 1 
RNA Biology </p>

<p>family members exploit similar mecha-
nisms and host factors for replication and 
translational regulation. 
44 This family was 
proposed to be a monophyletic group 
with main constituent genera Levivirus 
and Allolevivirus based on maximum like-
lihood and Bayesian estimation using the 
coat and replicase genes of nine species. </p>

<p>44 </p>

<p>Levivirus and Allolevivirus have difference 
in the genes encoded and the orientation 
of the open reading frame (ORF), albeit 
both having four genes. 
44 Each of these 
two genera is further sub-divided into two 
groups according to their serological 
cross-reactivity and the characteristics of 
the virion. 
44,45,48,49 Among them, MS2 
and GA are the typical species of Group I, 
II of the Levivirus, respectively; Qb and 
SP are the representative ones of Group 
III and IV of the Allolevivirus, 
respectively. </p>

<p>44,50 </p>

<p>Structure of 5 
0 UTR of maturation gene 
solves the competition between translation 
and replication on ssRNA template 
MS2, a model organism for Group I 
coli-phage of Levivirus, has a sense RNA 
genome encoding four proteins (starting 
from the 5 
0 end): maturation, coat, lysis, 
and replicase. 
8,51 Both maturation and 
coat proteins serve as the structural com-
ponent of the icosahedral virion, present-
ing a per-virion ratio of 1:180. 
8 The lysis 
protein lyses the host cell; the replicase 
and host factors comprise a holoenzyme 
responsible for the replication of strands 
in both polarities. 
8 As a result of the RNA 
genome, transcriptional regulatory tools 
are no longer available and the viral gene 
expression is thus regulated translationally 
to achieve the desired quantity and timing 
pertaining to these proteins. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>As Levivirus has a ss RNA genome serv-
ing as the template for both translation and 
replication, the ribosome and the replicase 
tend to compete in binding the template. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>To solve this conflict, the three distal genes 
share a single ribosomal entry site; more-
over, the ribosome and replicase share the 
same binding site around the start codon 
of the coat gene. 
7,8,52,53 The translation of 
the three distal genes is therefore coupled 
as the binding of replicase and of ribosome 
is mutually exclusive. 
7 Nevertheless, ribo-
some bound to the ORF of the maturation 
gene could potentially dislodge the </p>

<p>replicase travelling to the 5 
0 end. 
7 To pre-
vent this, transcript folding can exert a 
translational control by gate-keeping the 
ribosomal binding site(RBS) in a long-dis-
tance interaction (LDI) via an inhibitory 
upstream 
complementary 
sequence 
(UCS). 
8 This structure prevents the bind-
ing of the ribosome and yields way to the 
replicase. 
8,54 The translation of maturation 
protein is thus usually suppressed. When 
the formation of the secondary structure is 
prevented, 
translation 
increases. </p>

<p>8,55 </p>

<p>Expression of the maturation protein is key 
for the viral infection process as it can pro-
teolytically trigger the releasing of viral 
genome through contacting the F-pili of 
male; this only requires low copies of the 
maturation protein in Escherichia coli. </p>

<p>8,56 </p>

<p>The virus employs a co-transcriptional 
folding strategy to postpone the forma-
tion of this inhibitory LDI via seques-
tering the UCS in a metastable hairpin, 
enabling a transient translation of matu-
ration protein. 
7 Moreover, studying this 
translational control of the maturation 
protein brings deeper insight into the 
evolutionary divergence of Levivirus and 
Allolevivirus in the Family Leviviridae. </p>

<p>44 </p>

<p>Gene expansion is proposed to have 
occurred in Allolevivirus, which post-
pones the formation of the inhibitory 
LDI and therefore up-regulates the mat-
uration protein; subsequent mutations 
accumulate and restore the virus fitness, 
resulting in the difference between these 
two genera. </p>

<p>44,57 </p>

<p>Final inhibitory Structure 
The final cloverleaf-like structure consists 
of four hairpins 
The cloverleaf-like structure assumed 
by the 5 
0 UTR of equilibrated RNA from 
MS2 was first proposed by Groeneveld et 
al. (1995), consisting of a 5 
0 hairpin, and 
the downstream West (W), South (S) and 
East (E) arms 
7,8 (Fig. 2). An inhibitory 
UCS, immediately 3 
0 to the 5 
0 hairpin, 
pairs with the 7 nt Shine-Dalgarno(SD, 
AGGAGGU) sequence, forming a LDI. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>This cloverleaf-like structure, even includ-
ing the bulge in the bottom of the S arm, 
is evolutionarily conserved between MS2 
and KU1 which is a Group II Levivirus 
that varies from MS2 in terms of primary 
sequence. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>The cloverleaf-like and inactive struc-
ture forms once the first 123 nt of the 
plus-strand is synthesised. 
7 Meanwhile, 
the start codon is not replicated yet, and 
the translation initiation complex requires 
the transcript up to the first 145 nt. 
7 The 
maturation protein can therefore not be 
translated. 
7 The RBS of the maturation 
protein spanning from nucleotide 110 to 
145 can also pair with a stretch of down-
stream sequence to further sequester the 
RNA molecule in an inactive form. 
8 This 
ensures that the RBS is not accessible to 
the ribosome once the inactive cloverleaf 
structure is formed, otherwise the ribo-
some could be there to dislodge the pro-
gressing replicase. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>Experimental evidence 
Phylogenetic analysis reveals the con-
servation of the cloverleaf structure in the 
5 
0 UTR sequences of the maturation gene 
among Levivirus members: Groeneveld et 
al. (1995) assembled an alignment consist-
ing of four group I phages (fr, M12, 
JP501, MS2), and two group II phages 
(KU1, GA). 
8 They noticed that the struc-
tural features are generally preserved, 
albeit some variations in the W arm com-
paring the two groups and bulge shifting 
in the S arm comparing MS2 and 
M12. 
8,58,59 They also reported covariation 
being observed in all arms and, most 
importantly, in the LDI; particularly, the 
amount of covariations present in Group I 
and II are similar. 
8 In addition, they were 
able to employ the secondary-structure 
prediction program MFOLD (GCG sof-
ware, Genetics Computer Group, Madi-
son, WI) to predict the cloverleaf 
structure. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>Biochemical probing of the structure 
from a reference MS2 sequence is initial-
ised as well using a combination of DMS, 
DEP, CMCT, and RNase T1/T2/VT. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>The resultant probing pattern is consistent 
with the proposed structure in terms of 
sensitivity to modification or cleavage, 
including the bulge region. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>Functional analyses have been con-
ducted on the components of this cloverleaf 
structure through a series of mutants with 
deletions in variable portions of the arms. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>Any changes in the synthesis of the matura-
tion protein were thus attributed to the 
structural feature being mutated because </p>

<p>www.tandfonline.com

RNA Biology </p>

<p>the stability of these mutant RNAs was 
confirmed to be unchanged. 
8 Only the 
base-pairing potential rather than the pri-
mary sequence composition of the W arm 
is required for maturation protein transla-
tion. 
8 Moreover, deleting the entire UCS 
sequence or destabilising the LDI via muta-
tions significantly enhances the maturation 
protein synthesis, which is further evidence 
for the negative regulatory role of the UCS 
strand. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>Transient permissive Structure 
The transient structure consists of a 
metastable hairpin 
After Groeneveld et al. (1995) and 
Poot et al. (1997) proposed a kinetic 
model to explain the brief translation of 
maturation protein, a series of MS2 
mutants were designed by Van Meerten et 
al. (2001) to progressively locate the 
kinetic trap that contributes to the slow 
folding of the cloverleaf-like structure. </p>

<p>7,60 </p>

<p>This temporary kinetic trap, essentially a 
transient structure, is located in the 5 </p>

<p>0 </p>

<p>UTR. 
7 The precise position was further 
explored by replacing the W, S and E 
arms of MS2 arm by arm by the cognate 
arm from KU1. 
7 Finally, nt 37-45 of 
MS2, residing in the 5 
0 segment of the W 
arm, was identified as the functional 
sequence corresponding to the 3 
0 portion 
of a metastable hairpin which is conserved 
among MS2, KU1 and fr. </p>

<p>7 </p>

<p>This transient hairpin encompasses 4 
nts from the 3 
0 portion of the 5 
0 hairpin, 
the UCS, and 7 nts from the 5 
0 portion of 
the West arm originally in the cloverleaf-
like structure. 
7 Therefore, it disrupts the 
inhibitory LDI and thereafter frees the SD 
sequence, temporarily permitting the non-
equilibrated RNA to be captured by the 
translation machinery for a brief transla-
tion of the maturation protein during the 
limited time window, i.e., after the syn-
thesis of the RBS but before the LDI 
forms. 
7 Moreover, this truncates the 5 </p>

<p>0 </p>

<p>hairpin and exposes the G 
0 s at the start of 
the 5 
0 UTR as ss, which is stipulated by 
the viral replication; maturation protein 
complemented in trans is not enough to 
rescue a mutant with no metastable hair-
pin, which agrees with this additional 
role. </p>

<p>7 </p>

<p>This structure forms only co-transcrip-
tionally during the synthesis of the posi-
tive strand from an antisense template, 
and will be eventually replaced by the 
mutually exclusive LDI. 
7 This requires the 
ribosome to bind the RBS fast enough 
compared to the formation of the LDI, </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>which is demonstrated feasible. </p>

<p>61 </p>

<p>Experimental evidence 
Firstly, Groeneveld et al. indirectly 
tested the kinetic model by delineating the 
maturation protein synthesis contributed 
from the equilibrium model; the latter 
model states that RBS is occasionally freed 
from UCS during breathing if the fully-
bound LDI forms faster than ribosome </p>

<p>Figure 2. Schematic drawing for Levivirus (MS2). The UCS is highlighted in red color, the SD sequence is in yellow color, and the start codon is colored in 
green. In the left structure, the SD sequence is accessible to ribosome for translation. In the right structure, the SD pairs with the UCS, forming the LDI to 
impede ribosome binding. </p>

<p> 
Volume 12 Issue 1 
RNA Biology </p>

<p>binding. 
8 Through modulating 
the stability of the LDI via muta-
tions, they eliminated the possi-
bility of maturation protein 
being mostly synthesised by the 
equilibrated cloverleaf confor-
mation. </p>

<p>7,8 </p>

<p>Secondly, 
they 
directly assessed the kinetic 
model via adjusting the co-tran-
scriptional time delayed for the 
LDI formation, and concluded 
that this duration is positively 
correlated with the yield of mat-
uration protein. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>Moreover, 
computational simulation of the 
co-transcriptional folding trajec-
tory using <rs type="software">KINWALKER</rs> does pre-
dict both the transient kinetic 
trap 
and 
the 
cloverleaf 
structure. </p>

<p>51 </p>

<p>Mutational analysis also pro-
vides evidence supporting the 
functional importance of this 
metastable hairpin -the kinetic 
trap for this kinetic model -for 
the translation of maturation 
protein. Mutants with the meta-
stable hairpin disrupted pro-
duce no plaque whereas 
compensatory double mutation 
is able to rescue the fitness of 
the phage. 
7 On the other hand, 
mutation stabilising the meta-
stable structure via replacing the 
bulge by a base pair increases 
the translation of maturation. </p>

<p>7 </p>

<p>Furthermore, bulk evolution of 
those mutants with no metasta-
ble hairpin eventually leads to 
the restoration of the metastable 
hairpin. 
7 Taken together, they 
imply the necessity of the meta-
stable hairpin for the synthesis 
of maturation protein and thus 
the infection fitness of the 
phage. </p>

<p>Half-life of the structures 
In vitro, the cloverleaf struc-
ture requires several minutes to 
fully fold, whereas a tRNA with 
comparable size and conforma-
tion folds only on a millisecond time 
scale. 
7,60 This further suggests that the 
MS2 5 
0 UTR folding is delayed by being 
kinetically trapped in a non-native </p>

<p>structure. 
7 Given that coli-phage replicase 
proceeds at 30 nt per second (sec), the 
ribosome can stably bind the maturation 
protein start codon as long as the </p>

<p>cloverleaf structure is postponed to form 
by about 1 sec. 
7,62 Hence, the proposed 
translational control is convincing in 
terms of time. </p>

missive alternative structure is colored in pink. In the inhibitory alternative structure, Alt 1, 2, and 3 disrupt the

<p>HDV Ribozyme </p>

<p>Regulation of the HDV ribozyme self-
cleaving activity 
HDV HDV is an RNA satellite virus 
depending on hepatitis B virus (HBV), 
and aggravates the virulency of HBV-caus-
ing hepatitis. 
63 HDV has a circular and 
1700 nt long ssRNA genome, encoding 
the delta antigen protein. 
12,64 The high 
self-complementarity of the genome ena-
bles it to assumes a rod-like structure. </p>

<p>65-68 </p>

<p>A double-rolling-circle mechanism is 
exploited by HDV to replicate via the 
host RNA polymerase II, yielding linear 
multimers of both genomic and antige-
nomic senses 
64,68 .The multimers are sub-
sequently self-cleaved into monomers via 
a trans-esterification reaction catalyzed by 
the HDV ribozyme in cis. 
64,68 The linear 
monomers are then ligated into a circular 
genome via a host factor, which harbours 
the ribozyme-targeting cleavage site 
again. 
12,13 The ribozyme activity is turned 
off in the ligated RNA by interacting a 
downstream attenuator in order to serve 
as a template during the upcoming repli-
cation cycles. </p>

<p>12,69 </p>

<p>HDV ribozyme catalyses the self-cleavage 
activity 
This HDV ribozyme has a fast reaction 
rate which only depends on 85 nucleotides 
of either genomic or antigenomic RNAs 
requiring one nucleotide located 5 
0 of the 
cleavage site; limited variation is observed 
in this ribozyme. 
64,68,70,71 Both genomic 
and antigenomic ribozymes are enriched in 
G and fold into similar secondary struc-
tures, as concluded by aligning the geno-
mic and antigenomic sequences in search 
of sequence and structural similarity, sec-
ondary-structure prediction via minimum-
free-energy minimisation, and ribonucle-
ase digestion. </p>

<p>72 </p>

<p>Flanking sequence participates in the 
regulation of HDV ribozyme self-cleavage 
Non-catalytic sequences neighbouring 
the group I intron of Tetrahymena thermo-
phila can modulate the ribozyme self-
processing activity through base-pairing a 
functional portion of the ribozyme 
sequence. 
12,73-75 Consistent with this reg-
ulatory model, flanking sequences origi-
nated from virus and vector have been 
shown to affect the HDV ribozyme self-</p>

<p>cleaving activity. </p>

<p>71,76 </p>

<p>The upstream 
sequence 5 
0 to the self-cleavage site could 
thus be involved in regulating the self-
cleavage activity of the HDV ribozyme 
when the self-cleavage activity is not 
desired, but the downstream attenuator 
not readily available. That is, alternative 
structures formed co-transcriptionally and 
being mutually exclusive to the active con-
formation could potentially temporarily 
adjust the HDV ribozyme activity. 
12 This 
would require a thorough investigation of 
the co-transcriptional folding kinetics of 
the HDV ribozyme incorporating the 5 </p>

<p>0 </p>

<p>upstream sequence. 
13 Here, we summarise 
the findings in one inhibitory and one per-
missive structure for the HDV ribozyme 
self-cleaving activity. </p>

<p>12 </p>

<p>Active structure 
Active conformation consists of 5 stems: 
P1, P1.1, P2, P3, P4. </p>

<p>64 </p>

<p>(Fig. 3) 
The active double-pseudo-knotted 
structure assumes a nested structure fold-
ing the active site inside a catalytic cleft to 
shield it against the solvents. 
64 Coaxial 
stacking occurs among P1, P1.1 and P4; </p>

<p>Figure 4. Schematic drawing for SAM riboswitch. For both RNA structures, the stem of the terminator is colored in red, and the stem of the anti-anti-ter-
minator is colored in blue. In the SAM-unbound structure, the anti-terminator is formed by the 3' portion of the anti-anti-terminator and the 5' portion of 
the terminator hairpin; thus, the terminator hair can no longer form. The pseudoknot is not shown in this drawing. </p>

<p> 
Volume 12 Issue 1 
RNA Biology </p>

<p>P2 and P3 share another stack parallel to 
the aforementioned stack. 
64 Both pseudo-
knots are required for cleavage. 
64 The 
composition of helix P1 can be modulated 
without affecting the activity as long as 
the length, base-pairing potential and the 
G1*U37 wobble base pair are intact. </p>

<p>64 </p>

<p>Helix P1.1 consists of only two base pairs, 
but it is critical for rendering the ribozyme 
into its correct 3D conformation, espe-
cially the active site responsible for cleav-
age activity. 
64 Mutations breaking the 
P1.1 stem result in a significantly reduced 
ribozyme activity. 
64,77,78 The active con-
formation of the genomic HDV ribozyme 
has been examined by X-ray crystallogra-
phy, ribonuclease probing and site-specific 
mutagenesis. </p>

<p>64 </p>

<p>Structure preventing self-cleavage 
The inhibitory structure consists of Alt1, 
Alt2 and Alt3 
Due to the rapid self-cleavage of the 
HDV ribozyme, the ribonuclease </p>

<p>experiments were performed on the 3 </p>

<p>0 </p>

<p>self-cleavage product rather than the pre-
cursor. 
72 An extended transcript extending 
from 30 nt upstream of the cleavage site to 
15 nt downstream of the 3 
0 -end, denoted 
as ¡30/99 RNA, was found to have 
extremely diminished activity. 
12 The 
flanking sequence kinetically traps the 
ribozyme during transcription and results 
in a slow reaction rate, which can be 
improved by the addition of heat and 
denaturants to facilitate the formation of 
the active conformation. </p>

<p>12,71,72 </p>

<p>Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3 disrupt the P1.1, 
P2 and P3 stems in the active conforma-
tion, as revealed by the biochemical, 
computational, and mutational studies 
conducted by Chadalavada et al. (2000); 
in contrast, P1 and P4 remain the native 
conformation. 
12 P2 is proposed to form 
prior to the remaining HDV ribozyme 
and activate both genomic and antige-
nomic ribozyme, which may explain the 
resultant inactive conformation. </p>

<p>12,79,80 </p>

<p>Alt1 is a 10-bp LDI formed between an 
upstream inhibitory stretch (nt ¡25/-15 
related to the cleavage site) and the 
downstream stretch (nt 76/86). </p>

<p>12,81,82 </p>

<p>Alt2 is an interaction between upstream 
flanking sequence and the ribozyme, and 
Alt3 is a non-native ribozyme-ribozyme 
interaction. </p>

<p>12 </p>

<p>Experimental evidence 
Three experimental approaches provide 
evidence for the inhibitory secondary 
structure. 
12 Firstly, this extended tran-
script was directly probed via ribonu-
cleases due to its slow self-cleaving rate, 
and the cleavage results were used to con-
strain the structural prediction by MFOLD 
3.0, yielding the structure shown in Fig-
ure 7. 
12 Secondly, a series of DNA 
oligomers were used to rescue the ribo-
zyme activity of this inactive transcript. </p>

<p>12 </p>

<p>Among the oligomers, AS1 anneals to the 
entire upstream inhibitory stretch of Alt1, 
raising the reactivity rate by 2700-to </p>

<p>20,000-fold; AS2 only partially disrupts 
Alt1, nevertheless, it still accelerates the 
reactivity by 14-fold. 
12 These two oligom-
ers have no additive effect since sequester-
ing either portion of Alt1 is sufficient for 
disrupting this inhibitory LDI. 
12 Thirdly, 
mutations were introduced outside the 
ribozyme to ensure that the observed </p>

<p>ribozyme activity is caused by the stability 
of Alt1. 
12 Single mutations, destabilising 
Alt1, exhibit 150-fold increase in the reac-
tivity rate or even co-transcriptional self-
cleavage; double compensatory mutation, 
restoring Alt1, has similar reactivity to the 
inactive RNA transcript. 
12 Upon addition 
of AS1, these mutants show similar </p>

<p>reactivity rate to the active ribo-
zyme. 
12 Lastly, Alt1 and Alt 3 
are conserved among 21 geno-
mic isolates. 
12 These non-native 
structures are conserved perhaps 
due to their potential role in 
facilitating the formation of the 
genome rod-like structure 
which is required for replication 
and packaging. </p>

<p>12 </p>

<p>Structure permitting self-
cleavage 
Self-cleavage-permissive 
structure is an upstream hairpin 
The permissive structure for 
the self-cleavage of the HDV 
ribozyme is mapped to the nt 
¡54/-18 of the RNA transcript 
using the secondary-structure 
prediction program <rs type="software">MFOLD</rs>. </p>

<p>12 </p>

<p>This structure sequesters the 
inhibitory stretch of nt ¡24/-15 
from Alt1 in a hairpin P(-1) 
located upstream of the cleavage 
site. 
12,81,82 This extended RNA 
transcript is demonstrated 
experimentally to cleave co-
transcriptionally. 
12 P(-1) has 
bulges allowing G migrating, 
resulting in a more stable con-
formation due to the increased 
structural entropy. 
12,83 Hairpin 
P(-1) does not appear to inter-
act with the ribozyme domain 
as the ribozyme has similar self-
cleaving activity regardless of 
whether it is activated in trans 
(AS1 or AS2) or in cis. 
83 How-
ever, the P(-1) motif is not 
found in the antigenomic 
sequences, 
12 so only genomic 
sequences are assembled in our 
updated alignment for HDV 
ribozyme. </p>

<p>Experimental evidence 
Firstly, structural mapping 
via ribonuclease was used to probe the nt 
¡54/-1 fragment instead of the whole pre-
cursor transcript due to the fast-cleaving 
nature of this structure, which reveals a 
local hairpin P(-1) pairing nt ¡54/¡40 
with ¡18/-30. 
12 This structure is consis-
tent with the ss-count values calculated </p>

specifies the percentage of canonical base-pairs in the paired alignment columns, i.e. those connected by an 
arc. The right legend specifies the evolutionary support (e.g., covariation, etc.) for each position in the align-
ment. The alignment and arcs at the top show the information for the terminator structure, whereas the bottom 
ones correspond to the anti-terminator structure for the same underlying alignment. The lines in each align-
ment correspond to the respective sequences with every box representing either a nucleotide or a gap in the 
respective sequence. Every arc represents a base-pair involving the respective two alignment columns. The 
arcs are colour-coded according to their percentage of canonical base pairs, whereas the evolutionary informa-
tion supporting each base pair is encoded in the colouring of the underlying nucleotides in the base paired 
alignment columns, see the right legend for details. Two green blocks connected by an arc implies that this is a 
canonical base pair (i.e., GC, AU or GU) which corresponds to the most abundant type of base pair for this pair 
of alignment columns. Cyan means this is a canonical base pair but that it has an one-sided mutation with 
respect to the most abundant (green) base-pair. Blue refers to a canonical base-pair which differs on both sides 
from the most abundant (green) base-pair. Red means this is a non-canonical base pair. Unpaired nucleotides 
are shown in black and gaps in grey. </p>

<p>Secondly, evolutionary conser-
vation is found in hairpin P(-1) 
and the linking region between 
P(-1) and P1 among 21 geno-
mic HDV RNA isolates. 
12 Min-
imal sequence variation is also 
observed in this linking region 
(nt ¡17/¡1) which is pyrimi-
dine-rich and suspected to melt 
the annealing between the 
nascent transcript and the tem-
plate, facilitating the subsequent 
ribozyme folding. </p>

<p>12 </p>

<p>Half-life of the structures 
No direct data exists regard-
ing the half-life, but the mecha-
nism proposed for the HDV 
ribozyme resembles the one uti-
lised by the group I intron. </p>

<p>12 </p>

<p>Moreover, in the human HDV-
like CPEB3 ribozyme, a similar 
regulatory mechanism involving 
the flanking sequence was dis-
covered. 
13 As a follow-up study, 
an equilibrium model is pro-
posed comprising two interme-
diate and the native fold, which 
is confirmed by mutagenesis 
and kinetic characterization. 
84 In this 
model, the 5 
0 portion of P2 can base-pair 
with either the native 3 
0 portion or non-
native ribozyme sequence made of nucleo-
tides from P1, P3 and single-stranded 
regions. 
84 Given that P2 has a driving role 
in the correct folding of the HDV ribo-
zyme, the direction of the shifting of this 
equilibrium may explain the resultant 
ribozyme activity. </p>

<p>84 </p>

<p>SAM-responsive riboswitch </p>

<p>Regulation of gene expression via a 
riboswitch 
Riboswitches are proposed to be regu-
latory mechanisms that derive from the 
RNA world. 
85,86 They correspond to 
non-coding RNA structure elements 
located in the leader sequence of 
mRNA strands, which selectively bind 
certain metabolites to regulate the syn-
thesis of downstream products relevant </p>

<p>to this metabolite. 
2-4,11,87 This regula-
tory response is achieved by the coordi-
nation 
between 
the 
embedded 
metabolite-binding aptamer domain 
and the expression platform which 
switches between alternative structures 
upon sensing a change in the aptamer 
domain when a metabolite binds. </p>

<p>3,4,11 </p>

<p>The riboswitch can generally assume 
two mutually-exclusive structures -one 
metabolite-bound, and one metabolite-
unbound. This ligand recognition via 
aptamer can sequentially affect the 
interaction between the mRNA and the 
translational or transcriptional appara-
tus. 
88 The structure of the aptamer is 
typically evolutionarily conserved; for 
instance, the S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM) riboswitch discussed in this 
paper is well conserved among bacteria 
species. 
11 In SAM riboswitch, S box is 
the aptamer where the coenzyme SAM 
binds with high affinity, which often </p>

<p>precedes a putative transcription termi-
nator hairpin; the binding of SAM trig-
gers 
an 
allosteric 
change 
that 
subsequently terminates the transcrip-
tion. 
11,89 Overall, a riboswitch assigns 
the same mRNA both a sensory and an 
action role without requiring an inter-
mediate. 
90 This amounts to a speedy 
and sensitive responsive mechanism that 
is able to sense the conditions of the 
cellular environment with an accuracy 
comparable to mechanisms involving 
protein factors. </p>

<p>11,90 </p>

<p>Sam-unbound structure 
If the SAM is unbound, the anti-termi-
nator sequence can sequester the termina-
tor sequence to prevent the formation of 
terminator and the polymerase can prog-
ress through the downstream gene </p>

<p>Sam-bound structure 
Once the SAM is bound to the con-
served core of the aptamer, the anti-termi-
nator is sequestered by an anti-anti-
terminator; the terminator sequence is 
then freed to assume a terminator hairpin 
to end the transcription. </p>

<p>11,91 </p>

<p>Experimental evidence 
The SAM-bound structure was origi-
nally derived from the phylogenetic con-
servation observed in an alignment, </p>

<p>11,89 </p>

<p>and subsequently verified with disruptive 
and compensatory mutations using a 124-
nt long construct (from leader mRNA of </p>

<p>yitJ gene in B. subtilis) fused with a 
reporter gene, 
11 and later determined by 
X-ray crystallography. </p>

<p>The proposed transcriptional termi-
nation mechanism upon SAM addition 
was tested in vitro using the transcrip-
tion of 11 DNA templates harbouring 
the S box. 
11,86 The percentage of tran-
scription termination was compared 
between presence and absence of SAM, 
which demonstrated increasing tran-
scription termination upon addition of 
SAM. 
11 Moreover, all structural features 
involved in the transcription termina-
tion mechanism (i.e., the anti-termina-
tor, 
terminator, 
and 
anti-anti-
terminator) were directly confirmed 
using disruptive and compensatory </p>

<p>mutations. </p>

<p>11 </p>

<p>Such disruptive 
mutations destabilise terminator 
and anti-terminator individually 
or both; in comparison, the 
compensatory mutations restore 
terminator and anti-terminator 
individually or simultaneously. </p>

<p>11 </p>

<p>The corresponding percentage 
of SAM-induced transcription 
termination 
was 
compared 
among these mutants. 
11 The 
results show that terminator is 
required for the mechanism to 
respond to SAM and anti-termi-
nator is critical for relieving the 
transcriptional 
termination. </p>

<p>11 </p>

<p>Hence, such mutational analysis 
supports the functional roles of 
those proposed structural fea-
tures participating in the SAM-
induced transcriptional termina-
tion mechanism. </p>

<p>Alignments 
We summarize the key fea-
tures of our alignments in 
Tables 1 and 2. A small multi-
ple sequence alignment (MSA) 
from a previous project pub-
lished by us 
14 was used to build 
a primary covariance model 
(CM) using the <rs type="software">INFERNAL</rs> pro-
gram 
92 to search the full align-
ments in RFAM 
1 and the NCBI 
TAXONOMY BROWSER. 
93 In our 
previous research, 
14 these small 
MSA were compiled using evolution-
arily related sequences for these four 
RNA families, respectively. These small 
MSAs are of a high-quality with posi-
tive covariation and few gaps, making 
them convenient starting points to 
build the corresponding primary CMs. 
For each of our four alignments, we 
aligned the sequences of the seed align-
ment in RFAM with the primary CM 
first and then curated this against all 
experimentally verified structures which 
were first mapped to a reference 
sequence. We then build a secondary 
CM incorporating sequences from the 
RFAM seed alignment which we used to 
align the hits returned by the search </p>

<p>with the primary CM. These hits were 
clustered to reduce primary sequence 
redundancy, choosing a representative 
sequence for each cluster based on 
structural fit and covariation. Hits pass-
ing this selection strategy were retained 
only if they contained all alternative 
structures. We then calculated quality 
measures for the resulting hits to deter-
mine which ones to add to the existing 
small MSA. The resulting alignment 
was then curated recursively according 
to the aligning results returned by 
<rs type="software">INFERNAL</rs> using the secondary CM for 
each of the alternative structures. </p>

<p>Mapping structures 
Each of the alternative structures is 
mapped to the curated alignments via the </p>

<p>respective reference sequence, see Tables 1 
and 2 for the structure-specific quality 
measures. All quality measures for all new 
alignments show an improvement with 
respect to the corresponding RFAM align-
ments, if they exist, see Table 1. As the 
numbers in Table 2 show, the evolution-
ary evidence supporting the alternative 
structures is strong and comparable to 
those supporting the nominal structural 
features, see Table 1. This is also 
illustrated in the arc-plots shown in 
Figures 5-8. </p>

<p>Conclusions </p>

<p>We introduce four RNA families, the 
Trp operon leader, the Levivirus 5 
0 UTR, </p>

<p>the HDV ribozyme, and the Sam 
riboswitch, with transient struc-
tures that convey important 
functions critical to the regula-
tion of their gene expression. The 
functional roles of these transient 
structures are diverse and com-
prise transcription regulation 
(Trp operon and SAM ribos-
witch), self-cleavage (HDV ribo-
zyme) and translation regulation 
(Levivirus 5 
0 UTR). Moreover, 
we show for all four alignments 
that both the dominant and tran-
sient structures are evolutionarily 
conserved. Our four alignments 
and structural annotations either 
significantly update and extend 
the existing RFAM family or intro-
duce a new RNA family. 
Overall, we hope to make that 
the case that the structural anno-
tation of any RNA family ought 
to naturally also comprise func-
tional transient RNA structures. 
This will not only require further 
experimental research regarding 
their structure determination and 
the study of their functional 
roles, but also some adjustments 
in RFAM. It should be fairly easy 
to provide a dedicated structural 
annotation for each functional 
role for a given RNA family. It 
will be more difficult to extend 
seed alignments in RFAM into full 
alignments using the current 
computational analysis pipeline of RFAM 
as more than one covariance model 
may be required to capture both the 
dominant and transient RNA structures 
of a given RNA family. Finally, trans-
lating experimental evidence into a 
structural annotation of an RNA family, 
as shown here for four families, is not 
always a straightforward task for tran-
sient structures and may require more 
manual curation and expertise. Ribonu-
clease probing, for example, of regions 
embedded in alternative structures may 
display only minor hits, rendering the 
interpretation ambiguous. 
72 A concerted 
effort using a variety of experimental 
techniques as well as more sophisticated 
computational analysis tools will thus 
be required to arrive at complete </p>

<p>Materials and Methods </p>

<p>Primary covariation model: Initial 
Small Alignment 
A primary covariation model (cm) is 
constructed using a small good-quality 
alignment assembled previously by our 
group; 
14 repeat the CM compilation (i.e., 
build and calibrate in <rs id="software-17" type="software">INFERNAL</rs>-<rs corresp="#software-17" type="version-number">1.1rc2</rs>) 
for each of the alternative structures. If the 
structure contains pseudo-knots, it must 
be split into non-pseudo-knotted sub-
structures in order to process it in INFER-
NAL; if possible, compatible helices of such 
non-pseudo-knotted substructures and the 
remaining alternative structures are com-
bined into one structure so as to simplify 
the subsequent curation (e.g., in HDV, a 
non-pseudo-knotted substructure of the 
active conformation is added to the alt2 
structure). The aforementioned pre-
assembled alignments of Trp operon 
leader, Levivirus, HDV and SAM ribos-
witch have 10, 7, 10 and 15 sequences, 
respectively. </p>

<p>Secondary covariation model: pre-
assembled alignment + unique RFAM seed 
alignment sequences 
Firstly, the primary CM is used to align 
the sequences from the RFAM seed align-
ment (or only part of it, e.g., the alterna-
tive structures of HDV are only valid for 
the genomic sequences, so only genomic 
sequences are aligned here). This aligning 
procedure is repeated for the primary CM 
built from each of the alternative struc-
tures. Secondly, redundant sequences are 
removed from this expanded alignment 
(i.e., sequence from pre-assembled align-
ment + RFAM seed alignment), which is 
subsequently manually curated to opti-
mise the covariation for all alternative 
structures. Curation is initiated on the 
alignment generated by the CM with the 
structure with the largest number of base 
pairs, and the other alternative structural 
features are mapped onto the same align-
ment. During curation, <rs type="software">RALEE</rs> 
94 is used to 
visually compare the resultant alignments 
generated by the covariation models per-
taining to each alternative structure, and </p>

<p>structural overlapping regions are identi-
fied and then manually curated (section 
4.1 (iv) of Supplementary Material). 
Thirdly, a secondary CM is thus built and 
calibrated based on this expanded 
alignment. </p>

<p>Expanded Alignment: select sequences 
to add into the original 
small MSA 
Overlapped hits 
Firstly, the primary CM for each alter-
native structure is used to search the RFAM 
full alignment via <rs type="software">INFERNAL</rs> (alternatively, 
for Levivirus, NCBI TAXONOMY BROWSER 
is used by downloading the branch of the 
tree of life in which this non-coding RNA 
resides; for SAM riboswitch, we start our 
curation from an alignment provided by 
Winkler et al. (2003) 
11 and the SAM-
bound structure is also annotated by 
them). A sequence is retained only if the 
searches using the CM of each individual 
alternative structure all return this 
sequence as a hit, and if this sequence 
spans the full length of all the CM without 
truncated ends. A hit is defined as a candi-
date sequence that yields log-odds score 
greater than 0 in the search result. Sec-
ondly, the secondary CM is used to align 
the overlapped hits; repeat the aligning 
step for all secondary CM corresponding 
to each of the alternative structures. Since 
the alignment constructing the secondary 
CM is optimised for all alternative struc-
tures, aligning the hits using the secondary 
CM facilitates the following curation 
among all alternative structures. 
The search for homologs to add is only 
conducted on the RFAM full alignment 
rather than searching the NCBI from 
scratch, which is due to the fact that the 
qualified sequence to add must satisfy the 
requirement for all alternative structures. 
Thus, it would be more efficient but with-
out loss of generality to start from the can-
didates fitting well with at least one of the 
alternative structures, i.e., the RFAM full 
alignment. </p>

<p>Cluster the aligned overlapped hits 
In order to reduce the sequence redun-
dancy and increase the diversity, the align-
ment sequences comprised of the 
overlapped hits are clustered based on </p>

<p>primary sequence conservation via 
<rs type="software">USEARCH</rs>; 
95 different percentage iden-
tity cutoffs are tested to obtain around 50 
to 100 clusters. For each alternative struc-
ture, a best-fit sequence is chosen for each 
cluster using home-made scripts scoring 
the covariation. Best-fit sequences over-
lapped among all of the structures are 
identified as common hits. These com-
mon hits are then ranked and filtered 
based on the fit of the sequence to a struc-
ture and the extent of insertions relative to 
the reference sequence, which gives rise to 
a MSA for each structure. </p>

<p>Criteria for selecting sequences to add 
The structural measures (e.g., covaria-
tion, gappiness) of these ranked common 
hit sequences in the alignment are then 
incrementally calculated starting from the 
top sequence for each alternative structure, 
respectively. Thus, a set of sequences 
could be chosen systematically to be added 
to the original small alignment to enhance 
the alignment quality. Sequences added 
should maintain the positive overall 
covariation score of this alignemnt, have 
few invalid base-pairs, the least number of 
insertions introducing gaps, and no signif-
icant redundancy in terms of primary 
sequence identity among them. </p>

<p>Curation 
Visual inspection and manual compari-
son are finally conducted to improve the 
alignment quality in terms of structural 
fitting. Homologous regions must be 
aligned based on their primary sequence: 
they cannot be shuffled around merely to 
satisfy the reference structure if they are 
obvious to be homologous to a neighbour-
ing region and not to the reference helix 
region. Ensure any region (including non-
structural) with known binding site, or 
other knowledge concerning the conserva-
tion in primary sequence is properly 
aligned. The detailed curation steps are 
described in section 4 of Supplementary 
Material. </p>
