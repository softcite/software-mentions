<p>Objectives: Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that depression can be </p>

<p>effectively treated by omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Therefore, we conducted 
this meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the clinical applicability of the combination of 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are the two major bioac-
tive types of PUFAs, in depressed women. 
Methods: RCTs that compared the combination of DHA and EPA to placebo for short-course </p>

<p>treatment of depression in women were systematically reviewed up to March 2015. Outcome 
measurement was the standardized difference in means in clinical measure of depression sever-
ity. Random effect model was performed. Meta-regression analysis was performed to assess 
the effects of baseline depression scores. 
Results: Data were obtained from eight RCTs. In these RCTs, 182 patients received placebo </p>

<p>and 185 patients received DHA and EPA. The pooled standardized difference in mean was 
0.65 with 95% CI = [0.18, 1.12]. There was no relation between the efficacy and the baseline 
depression scores. The sensitivity analysis found that the combination of EPA and DHA as 
monotherapy yielded a standardized difference in means of 0.65 (95% CI =0.41, 0.90) without 
heterogeneity. 
Discussion: These results indicate a beneficial effect of the combination of EPA and DHA on </p>

<p>depressed mood in women compared with placebo. The clinical applicability of EPA and DHA 
showed greater promise and should be further explored. 
Depression is one of the most debilitating mental disorders in psychiatry field, which 
affects more than 10% of the population and results in more than 10% of the global 
disease burden. 1-3 There are about 10%-20% free-living elderly subjects and 20%-30% 
elderly hospitalized patients experiencing the depressive symptoms. 4 Currently, despite 
a large number of established medication options for depression, about 19%-34% 
of patients fail to respond to the first-line treatments. 5 On the other hand, the female 
preponderance of depression and its emergence in adolescence was reported by most 
of the studies. 6 Studies reported that the prevalence of depression was doubled in girls 
than boys between 15 years and 19 years, 7 and this trend persisted until 54 years. 8 
Some studies reported a higher prevalence of depression in women than men, even 
after menopause. 9 This sex disparity indicated that gonadal hormones might play a </p>

<p>potential role in the etiology of depression. Additionally, 
some data have raised the concern that using selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants during the pregnancy 
may result in self-limited neonatal behavioral syndrome. 10 
Based on these results, there is an urgent need to identify a 
new treatment for depression in women. 
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including 
the two major bioactive types: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 
and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are nutritional compounds, 
which are not synthesized by the human body. 11,12 Omega-3 
PUFAs are considered a necessary dietary component. Some 
studies reported that the deficit of DHA, EPA, or both in 
cell membranes or plasma was associated with an increased 
incidence of depression. 13,14 The decreased levels of DHA 
and/or EPA were found in depressed patients. 15 Furthermore, 
researchers found that PUFAs may be beneficial in individu-
als with diagnosed depressive illness. 16 However, previous 
studies have demonstrated inconsistent findings regarding 
the efficacy of DHA and/or EPA in treating depression in 
women. 17,18 Freeman et al reported that there was no sig-
nificant difference between omega-3 PUFAs and placebo in 
treating depression in women. 17 But Rondanelli et al reported 
that the supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs had therapeu-
tic benefits in women with depression. 18 These discrepant 
conclusions may be due to a lack of statistical power among 
some of the individual clinical trials. 19 Therefore, this work 
seeks to examine the efficacy of DHA and EPA on treating 
depression in women. We hypothesized that the combined 
application of DHA and EPA could yield antidepressant 
effect on women with depression. This meta-analysis should 
obtain a more accurate conclusion by integrating the results 
from multiple studies. 20 </p>

<p>Methods 
study selection </p>

<p>The first step of this meta-analysis was to identify eligible 
trials. Electronic searches were performed in international 
databases (PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, 
Web of Science, Embase), two Chinese databases (China 
Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infra-
structure), and relevant websites dated up to December 
2014. The search terms used were "depress*" combined 
with "omega-3", "PUFA", "polyunsaturated fatty acids", 
"DHA", and "EPA". In order to mitigate language bias, no 
language restriction was imposed. Reference documents 
listed in relevant papers, conference summaries, and the 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also 
researched. </p>

<p>We selected studies for subsequent analysis according 
to the following inclusion criteria: 1) randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) comparing omega-3 fatty acid and placebo 
(active or not); 2) women patients over 18 years of age; 
3) informed consent provided; 4) outcome assessed by 
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Clinical Global Impres-
sion, Beck Depression Inventory, or Geriatric Depression 
Scale; and 5) used EPA and DHA at the same time. Mean-
while, studies according with any of the following criteria 
were excluded: 1) nonrandom allocation; 2) case reports and 
reviews; and 3) duplicate studies. </p>

<p>Data extraction </p>

<p>Two reviewers independently verified all potentially suitable 
studies by the inclusion/exclusion criteria and completed the 
data abstraction. Any disagreement was solved by consensus, 
and if needed, a third reviewer was consulted. Data extracted 
from the included studies were recorded in a structured 
fashion as follows: 1) patients characteristics (ie, mean age, 
mean depression score, country, and outcome measurement); 
2) treatment parameters (ie, treatment time, treatment strategy, 
and daily dose); and 3) outcome measures (ie, mean score of 
depression after the intervention and dropouts). When the trials 
reported results from different kinds of rating scales, HDRS 
was preferentially selected. For data that could not be directly 
extracted from the study, the data were retrieved through cor-
respondence with the primary author or from other studies. </p>

<p>Bias risk assessment </p>

<p>Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each 
included RCTs according to the Cochrane Collaboration 
criteria. 21 Bias risk was assessed by the following items: 
the quality of randomization, using the allocation conceal-
ment, blinding the investigators and patients, and reporting 
incomplete data and similar baseline clinical characteristics. 
Studies with two or more bias risks were excluded from the 
subsequent meta-analysis. </p>

data were extracted as mean and standard deviations (SDs). 
All depression scales' means and SDs at the beginning of 
treatment and after treatment in two groups were combined. 22 
To correct for small sample bias, the standardized mean effect 
for included RCTs was calculated by using Hedges' g. 23 </p>

<p>combined application of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid </p>

<p>We used the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model, as it 
was assumed that the included RCTs probably had varying 
true treatment effects. 24 But if there was no heterogeneity, the 
fixed-effects model was used. If needed, subgroup analysis 
and sensitivity analysis were conducted. Heterogeneity was 
investigated using the Q-statistic and I 2 . 25 The Egger test and 
funnel plots were conducted to assess the potential presence 
of publication bias. The protocol of this work followed the 
recommendations for conducting a meta-analysis. 26 </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Totally, 254 potentially relevant studies were obtained in 
the initial Internet search. Among these, we first excluded 
76 studies by reviewing the titles. Second, we excluded </p>

<p>167 additional studies by reviewing the abstract. Third, we 
excluded eleven additional studies by two reviewers inde-
pendently reviewing the full texts. Finally, eight RCTs met 
all the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were used for the 
subsequent analysis (Figure 1). Although the references listed 
behind these studies were researched for possibly omitted 
RCTs, no more RCTs were found. </p>

<p>characteristics of the eight studies </p>

<p>These eight RCTs contained an aggregate of 367 adult 
patients, composed of 182 patients receiving placebo and 185 
patients receiving EPA and DHA. 17,18,27-32 Three RCTs used 
paraffin oil as placebo; 17,18,31 two RCTs used olive oil ethyl 
esters as placebo; 27,32 and another three RCTs used sunflower </p>

<p>oil, corn oil, and Sunola oil as placebo. 24,29,30 The dose of EPA 
was higher than that of DHA in seven RCTs, but the dose of 
DHA (1.64 g) was higher than that of EPA (0.42 g) in Rees 
et al. 29 Six RCTs used EPA and DHA as monotherapy, 18,27-31 
and two RCTs used them as an augmentation agent (supportive 
psychotherapy, 17 tert-butylhydroquinone and tocopherols 32 ). 
Patients in seven RCTs received 8 weeks of treatment, but 
patients in Rees et al received 6 weeks of treatment. 29 The age 
of all patients in three RCTs was more than 65 years. 18,28,31 The 
detailed information is described in Tables 1 and 2. </p>

<p>Bias risk assessment </p>

<p>In this review, the eight studies used randomization and 
conducted allocation concealment. All studies reported the 
similar baseline characteristics and incomplete data. As far as 
we know, in clinical studies, the double-blind was difficult, 
but all these included RCTs blinded the investigators and 
patients. Thus, the eight RCTs in this review were consis-
tently of high quality. As these RCTs displayed no bias risk, 
all RCTs were used in this meta-analysis (Table 3). </p>

<p>standardized difference in means </p>

<p>All the included RCTs reported the data at the treatment end 
point. 17,18,27-32 The pooled standardized difference in means 
was 0.52 (95% CI =0.31, 0.73) for the fixed-effects model </p>

<p>and 0.65 (95% CI =0.18, 1.12) for the random-effects model 
(Figure 2), which indicated a beneficial effect of the combi-
nation of EPA and DHA on depressed mood compared with 
placebo. But, significant heterogeneity in effect size existed 
(P,0.0001, I 2 =78%). In order to check whether or not the 
depression scores on baseline played a role in the efficacy 
of the combination of EPA and DHA, we performed a meta-
regression analysis. The results indicated that there was no 
relation between the efficacy and the baseline depression 
scores (regression coefficient =0.015; 95% CI =−0.007, 
0.034; P=0.24). No significant asymmetry in the inverted 
funnel plots of these RCTs appeared. Meantime, the Egger 
test was conducted, and the result showed that the outcome 
was not influenced by the publication bias (P=0.32). </p>

<p>sensitivity analysis </p>

<p>Two RCTs used the combination of EPA and DHA as an 
augmentation agent. 17,32 Then, we excluded these two RCTs 
to investigate the efficacy of EPA and DHA as monotherapy. 
The results showed that the pooled standardized difference 
in means was 0.65 (95% CI =0.41, 0.90) for the fixed-effects 
model (Figure 3). This exclusion did not significantly affect 
the initial effect size estimates for the whole sample, but no 
significant heterogeneity existed (P=0.33, I 2 =13%). One study 
recruited four (18%) men with major depression disorder </p>

did not significantly affect the initial effect size estimates. </p>

<p>subgroup analysis </p>

<p>Three RCTs mainly used Geriatric Depression Scale to assess 
the outcome, 18,28,31 and five RCTs mainly used HDRS to assess 
the outcome. 17,27,29,30,32 Then we did subgroup analysis accord-
ing to the outcome measurement. The results showed that the 
five RCTs and three RCTs yielded the standardized differ-
ence in means of 0.34 (95% CI =0.07, 0.61) and 0.82 (95% 
CI =0.47, 1.17), respectively. Three RCTs recruited patients 
with an average age of above 80 years 18,28,31 and five RCTs 
recruited patients with an average age of 30-50 years. 17,27,29,30,32 
Then we did subgroup analysis according to the age. The 
results showed that the three RCTs and five RCTs yielded the 
standardized difference in means of 0.34 (95% CI =0.07, 0.61) 
and 0.82 (95% CI =0.47, 1.17), respectively. These results 
indicated that the different outcome measurement methods 
and age did not influence the outcomes. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>This meta-analysis first investigated the efficacy of EPA and 
DHA in the treatment of depressed women. Compared to </p>

<p>the placebo, the combination of EPA and DHA had signifi-
cantly better efficacy with pooled standardized difference in 
means of 0.65 (95% CI =0.18-1.12, z=2.70, P=0.007), but 
significant heterogeneity existed (P,0.0001, I 2 =78%). After 
excluding the two studies that used the combination of EPA 
and DHA as an augmentation agent, the pooled standardized 
difference in means had no changed, but significant hetero-
geneity non-existed (P=0.33, I 2 =13%). These results showed 
that the combination of EPA and DHA could effectively treat 
the depression in women. 
Mischoulon et al hypothesized that subjects with diets low 
in PUFAs would have higher baseline severity of depression. 33 
The association between depression and PUFAs has been 
reported by several studies. 34,35 One study reported that the 
DHA levels were particularly lower in the postmortem orbitof-
rontal cortex of female patients with major depressive disorder 
than their male counterparts. 36 Another study using adipose 
tissue, which reflects long-term dietary fat intake, also found 
a significantly lower DHA concentrations in female MDD 
patients than male MDD patients. 37 The reason might be the 
conversion of alpha-linolenic acid to DHA, positively regu-
lated by estrogen. 38 Meanwhile, many evidences have impli-
cated estrogen in the pathophysiology of MDD in women. 39,40 
Furthermore, another study found that the low levels of DHA 
could predict the low levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, which </p>

<p>was implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. 41 This 
work found that the supplementation of PUFAs could yield 
better efficacy for women with depression. Moreover, all the 
included studies showed that PUFAs were well tolerated by 
postpartum and pregnant women. 
Seven of eight studies in this meta-analysis used the 
larger dose of EPA than DHA. Previous study showed that 
EPA had an effect on core depressive symptoms, such as 
guilt feelings, depressed mood, and worthlessness as well 
as insomnia. 42 Mischoulon et al reported that the observed 
decrease in HAM-D-17 score was significant for the EPA 
group, but not for the placebo group. 33 They also found that 
the administration of EPA resulted in a significant increase 
in mean plasma EPA, but had limited effect on plasma DHA. 
The mechanism of EPA and DHA was different. The EPA 
might influence mood by acting through eicosanoid mecha-
nisms to increase cerebral blood flow. The brains contained 
much more DHA than EPA, which might partly explain why 
many studies used the larger dose of EPA than DHA. 
Depression comorbidity with other diseases, such as 
cardiovascular diseases and dementia, in the elderly popu-
lation often lower the effects of antidepressive treatments. 
This might be caused by the age or the comorbidity. In this 
meta-analysis, we found that the combined application of 
EPA and DHA in younger women with depression yielded 
a better antidepressant effect than that in elderly women with 
depression (standardized difference in means, 0.82 versus 
0.34). Although these results were limited by the relatively 
small studies, the treatments for elderly women with depres-
sion needed more attention. 
Several limitations should be addressed here: 1) the num-
ber of included RCTs and depressed patients were relatively 
small; 2) the dose of EPA and DHA, the age of included 
patients, and the used placebo were not exactly the same 
and there were also the general problems for metastudies 
to solve; 3) four of 367 included patients were men; and </p>

<p>4) whether or not it is appropriate to apply this conclusion to 
postpartum depression and male with depression or vascular 
depression is unknown. However, this pooled analysis of 
eight double-blinded RCTs found that the clinical applica-
bility of EPA and DHA showed greater promise and should 
be further explored. </p>
