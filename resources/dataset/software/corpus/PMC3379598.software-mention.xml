<p>OBJECTIVEdTo examine the relationship between access to health care and diabetes control. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdUsing data from the National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey, 1999-2008, we identified 1,221 U.S. adults (age 18-64 years) with 
self-reported diabetes. Access was measured by current health insurance coverage, number of 
times health care was received over the past year, and routine place to go for health care. Diabetes 
control measures included the proportion of people with A1C .9%, blood pressure $140/90 
mmHg, and non-HDL cholesterol $130 mg/dL. </p>

<p>RESULTSdAn estimated 16.0% of known diabetic adults were uninsured. Diabetes control 
profiles were worse among uninsured than among insured persons (A1C .9% [34.1 vs. 16.5%, 
P = 0.002], blood pressure $140/90 mmHg [31.8 vs. 22.8%, P , 0.05], and non-HDL choles-
terol $130 mg/dL [67.1 vs. 65.4%, P = 0.7]). Compared with insured persons, uninsured 
persons were more likely to have A1C .9% (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio 2.4 [95% CI 
1.2-4.7]). Compared with those who reported four or more health care visits in the past year, 
those who reported no health care visits were more likely to have A1C .9% (5.5 [1.2-26.3]) and 
blood pressure $140/90 mmHg (1.9 [1.1-3.4]). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdIn people with diabetes, lack of health care coverage is associated with 
poor glycemic control. In addition, low use of health care service is associated with poor glucose 
and blood pressure control. </p>

<p>Study variables 
We measured health care access through 
insurance coverage, derived from the 
answer to the question, "Are you covered by 
health insurance or some other kind of 
health care plan?" We measured the follow-
ing: 1) The number of times the participant 
received health care during the past 12 
months, derived from the question, "Dur-
ing the past 12 months, how many times 
have you seen a doctor or other healthcare 
professional about your health at a doctor's 
office, a clinic, hospital emergency room, at 
home or some other place?" This variable 
was categorized as three levels: none, the 
second-less-frequent health care use cate-
gory (one to three times per year), and the 
American Diabetes Association (ADA)-
recommended category (more than four 
times per year) (2). And 2) Routine place 
to go for health care, referring to any 
place to which people were usually going 
for care, derived from two questions: "Is 
there a place that you usually go when you 
are sick or you need advice about your 
health?" and "What kind of place do you 
go to most often: is it a clinic, a doctor's 
office, emergency room, or some other 
place?" Those who answered "no place" 
were categorized as "no regular place of 
care." Those who answered "having a 
place" were further divided into three cat-
egories according to the respondents' 
choices: hospital emergency room, outpa-
tient department, and other; clinic or health-
care center; and doctor's office or HMO. 
Based on ADA recommendations, A1C 
.9% was defined as poor glycemic con-
trol, and blood pressure $140/90 mmHg 
was defined as high blood pressure (2). Ac-
cording to American Heart Association 
recommendations, non-HDL cholesterol 
$130 mg/dL was defined as high non-
HDL cholesterol (16). In this study, the 
ABCs of diabetes were measured through 
1) A1C (a dichotomized variable of A1C 
level .9%), 2) blood pressure $140/90 
mmHg (a dichotomized variable of systolic 
blood pressure level $140 mmHg and di-
astolic blood pressure level $90 mmHg), 
and 3) non-HDL cholesterol levels (a di-
chotomized variable of non-HDL choles-
terol $130 mg/dL). 
Socioeconomic status, marital status, 
family history of diabetes, and self-rated 
health are associated with health care use 
(17-20). We controlled for seven sociode-
mographic factors: age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
marital status, education, family poverty 
index ratio (PIR), and family history of 
diabetes. We also used as covariates BMI 
(measured as kilograms divided by the </p>

<p>square of height in meters), smoking status, 
diabetes medication use, and a dichotomized 
version of self-rated health ("good or better" 
versus "fair/poor"). </p>

<p>Data analysis 
We used multivariate logistic regression 
models to examine the relationship between 
access to health care and diabetes control. 
Independent variables included age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, marital status, education, 
family PIR, BMI, self-reported family his-
tory of diabetes, diabetes medication use, 
and self-rated health. Accounting for the 
possibility of nonlinearity, we explored 
quadratic relationships of the continuous 
variables (age and BMI) with each of the </p>

<p>outcomes. Squared terms were retained in 
the model only if statistically significant at 
P , 0.05. 
Data were weighted to represent the 
U.S. diabetic population ages 18-64 years. 
Analyses were performed, using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">9.2</rs> 
and <rs id="software-2" type="software">SUDAAN</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">10.0.1</rs> (21), to adjust for 
the complex survey sample design. We 
conducted two-tailed t tests and considered 
results significant when P was ,0.05. </p>

<p>RESULTSdRespondents (1,221 repre-
senting 8,119,276 American adults with 
diabetes) aged 18-64 years self-reported 
that they had diabetes. Of these, 962 (rep-
resenting 6,429,698 American adults with 
diabetes) were insured (84.0%; an estimate </p>

<p>projected for the U.S. diabetic population 
aged 18-64 years), and 259 (representing 
1,689,578 American adults with diabetes) 
were uninsured (16.0%) (Table 1). Unin-
sured persons with diabetes were younger 
(48.3 vs. 50.4 years of age) and more likely 
to be Mexican American (27.7 vs. 7.4%), to 
be less educated (e.g., education attainment 
less than high school, 44.3 vs. 22.8%, and 
more than high school, 30.8 vs. 51.9%), to 
live below the federal poverty level (mean 
PIR 1.8 vs. 3.0), and to have a lower BMI 
(31.9 vs. 34.4 kg/m 2 ) and more likely to 
report fair or poor health (59.1 vs. 42.8%) 
than those who were insured. The percen-
tages of diabetes medication use were not 
different between insured and uninsured 
groups (P = 0.17). In general, uninsured 
persons had worse diabetes control and 
management profiles than their insured 
counterparts: 34.1 vs. 16.9% with A1C 
.9%, P = 0.002; 31.8 vs. 22.8% with blood 
pressure $140/90 mmHg, P , 0.05; and 
67.1 vs. 65.4% with non-HDL cholesterol 
$130 mg/dL, P = 0.7. 
Insurance coverage was associated 
with both frequency of health care use and 
routine place to go for health care; un-
insured persons less frequently than the 
insured visited a doctor or other health 
care professional (e.g., 12.2% of uninsured 
persons reported not visiting a doctor dur-
ing the past 12 months compared with only 
2.1% of insured falling into this category). 
In the second-less-frequent health care 
use category (one to three times per year), 
uninsured were still more likely to fall into 
this category than insured (38.6 vs. 27%, 
respectively); on the contrary, in the ADA-
recommended category (four or more 
times per year), uninsured were less likely 
to fall into this category than insured (49.3 
vs. 70.9%). They were more likely to report 
no routine place to go for health care (10.4 
vs. 1.7%, P , 0.001). Furthermore, fre-
quency of health care use was associated 
with diabetes control (Fig. 1). In general, 
diabetes control profile was improved as 
the number of health care visits increased. 
Those who did not report a health care visit 
had poorer diabetes control outcomes than 
those who reported health care visits four 
or more times in the past year: mean A1C 
9.1 vs. 7.4%, P = 0.014; mean systolic 
blood pressure 127.6 vs. 126.2 mmHg, 
P = 0.56; mean diastolic blood pressure 
79.6 vs. 72.4 mmHg, P = 0.002; and mean 
non-HDL cholesterol 171.3 vs. 146.6 mg/dL, 
P , 0.001, respectively. 
Access to health care was associated 
with diabetes control (Table 2). From our 
unadjusted model (model 1), we found </p>

<p>that compared with those who were in-
sured, their uninsured counterparts were 
more likely to have an A1C level .9% 
(odds ratio [OR] 2.5 [95% CI 1.6-4.2]) and 
to have blood pressure $140/90 mmHg 
(1.6 [1.0-2.5]). Compared with those 
who reported a health care visit four or 
more times in the past year, those who re-
ported none had 3.8 times higher odds of 
having A1C .9% (4.8 [1.6-14.1]). Com-
pared with those who used doctors' offices 
or HMO facilities for routine care, those 
who reported no regular place for care 
had 1.7 times higher odds of having A1C 
.9% (2.7 [1.1-6.8]). </p>

<p>After we adjusted for race/ethnicity 
(model 2), we found that health insurance 
coverage and having at least one health 
care visit in the past year were still associated 
with glycemic control as shown in model 1. 
Regardless of ethnicity, access to health care 
independently accounted for variations in 
glycemic control. 
After adjustments for age, sex, marital 
status, education, family PIR, BMI, family 
history of diabetes, smoking status, diabetes 
medication use, and self-rated health (model 
3), we found that compared with those who 
were insured, their uninsured counterparts 
were more likely to have A1C level .9% </p>

<p>Access to health care and diabetes control </p>

<p>(OR 2.4 [95% CI 1.2-4.7]). Frequency of 
health care use was related to both glycemic 
control and blood pressure control. Com-
pared with those who reported four or more 
health care visits in the past year, those who 
reported none had a higher likelihood to 
have A1C .9% (5.5 [1.2-26.3]) and to 
have blood pressure $140/90 mmHg (1.9 
[1.1-3.4]). In the multivariate model 3, 
having a routine place to go for health care </p>

<p>was no longer significantly associated with 
poor glycemic control. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdUsing a nationally 
representative sample of U.S. adults with 
diabetes, we found that lack of access to health 
care was associated with diabetes control. 
We found that the diabetes control profile 
was related to health insurance coverage and 
number of health care visits. Those who were </p>

<p>uninsured reported fewer health care visits 
and were more likely not to have a usual 
source of care than those who were insured. 
Furthermore, the uninsured were more likely 
to have worse diabetes control profiles. 
A previous study demonstrated that 
although diabetes processes of care and in-
termediate outcomes improved over time 
between 1988 and 2002, the difference in 
diabetes control between insured and un-
insured populations persisted (22). Consis-
tent with this study, our study found similar 
associations between access to health care 
and diabetes control. Although not all asso-
ciations were statistically significant, the 
combined effect appeared strong in the as-
sociation of access to health care with diabe-
tes control. 
For prevention and management of 
diabetes complications, a Position State-
ment of the ADA addressed the impor-
tance of routine diabetes visits for testing 
and screening (2). Access to health care is 
associated with the frequency of health care 
use among patients with chronic conditions 
(5,23). Our study further demonstrated 
that access to health care is associated with 
both the frequency of health care use and 
health care outcomes. Diabetes complica-
tions control and management depend 
on a continuing interaction between health 
care providers and patients. Through this 
interaction, patients and health care pro-
viders share information, which tends to 
improve diabetes care and control. Lack 
of access to health care could make this in-
teraction difficult, thereby bringing about 
negative health outcomes. 
It is well-known that having a regular 
doctor or having a usual source of care is 
important to health outcomes, and the 
former is further associated with receiving 
preventive care (24,25). In our unadjusted 
model, those who reported no place to go 
were less likely to control their A1C than 
those who used doctor offices or HMO fa-
cilities for their health care. However, this 
association was no longer significant in the 
multivariate model. 
Race/ethnicity has been found to be 
related to poor access to health care (26,27). 
In the U.S., Hispanics have been found to 
have significantly less access to health care 
than non-Hispanics (28-30). One study 
found that even though access to health 
care differed among Caucasians, African 
Americans, and Mexican Americans, the 
health status and outcomes for adults with 
type 2 diabetes did not significantly differ 
among these groups, and health status 
seemed not to be influenced by access to 
health care (31). Although our study also </p>

<p>found that Hispanics had less access, we 
also demonstrated that the uninsured had 
worse glycemic control profiles than those 
who were insured. When we adjusted for 
race/ethnicity in our model, the results from 
the adjusted model remained almost the 
same as those from the unadjusted model, 
indicating that the association of access to 
health care with glycemic control was inde-
pendent of race/ethnicity. These findings 
have never been reported before, and our 
study makes significant contribution to the 
public health literature. 
In our multivariate models, it was 
noticeable that lack of health insurance 
coverage and not having a health care visit 
in the past year were mainly associated with 
glycemic control. In model 3, only the lack 
of health care visits was significantly associ-
ated with blood pressure control. A tentative 
explanation could be that many low-cost 
generic medications to treat hyperlipidemia 
lipids and hypertension are available, but 
insulin, a primary tool to treat hyperglyce-
mia, may still be very expensive and, there-
fore, less accessible. This, in turn, made the 
association of access to health care with 
glycemic control more visible (32). 
Our study has both strengths and 
limitations. Strengths include nationally 
representative data and having controlled 
for sociodemographic, anthropometric, 
and health status. Limitations include the 
relatively small sample of persons in some 
categories of health care use and routine 
place to go for health care. Access to health 
care is better considered as a multidimen-
sional concept with five domains: avail-
ability, organization, financing, use, and 
satisfaction (33). However, our data source 
only addressed two of these five domains 
(financing and use). This study used data 
from NHANES 1999-2008. Because the 
National Center for Health Statistics with-
drew the 2007-2008 A1C data from public 
release recently, our analyses of poor glyce-
mic control were restricted to NHANES 
1999-2006 (N = 889). The decrease in 
sample size (from N = 1,221 to N = 889) 
might have affected the association of poor 
glycemic control with access to health care. 
If the 2007-2008 A1C data were available 
and used in our analyses, we might have 
enhanced our analytic power and strength-
ened other associations of poor glycemic 
control with access to health care from mar-

Our findings indicate that limited ac-

associated with poor glycemic control and 
blood pressure control, suggesting that </p>

of risk factors among U.S. adults with di-

need to improve access to health care 
among persons with diabetes on the one

from which to evaluate the effects of health 
reform on the other. </p>
