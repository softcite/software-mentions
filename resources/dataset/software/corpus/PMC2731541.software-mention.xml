<p>OBJECTIVE-An increased expression of RELM-(resistin-like 
molecule-), a gut-derived hormone, is observed in animal mod-
els of insulin resistance/obesity and intestinal inflammation. 
Intestinal sugar absorption is modulated by dietary environment 
and hormones/cytokines. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the effect of RELM-on intestinal glucose absorption. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Oral glucose toler-
ance test was performed in mice and rats in the presence and the 
absence of RELM-. The RELM-action on glucose transport in 
rat jejunal sacs, everted rings, and mucosal strips was explored 
as well as downstream kinases modulating SGLT-1 and GLUT2 
glucose transporters. </p>

<p>RESULTS-Oral glucose tolerance test carried out in rodents 
showed that oral administration of RELM-increased glycemia. 
Studies in rat jejunal tissue indicated that mucosal RELM-
promoted absorption of glucose from the gut lumen. RELM-had 
no effect on paracellular mannitol transport, suggesting a trans-
porter-mediated transcellular mechanism. In studies with jejunal 
mucosa mounted in Ussing chamber, luminal RELM-inhibited 
SGLT-1 activity in line with a diminished SGLT-1 abundance in 
brush border membranes (BBMs). Further, the potentiating 
effect of RELM-on jejunal glucose uptake was associated with 
an increased abundance of GLUT2 at BBMs. The effects of 
RELM-were associated with an increased amount of protein 
kinase C II in BBMs and an increased phosphorylation of 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS-The regulation of SGLT-1 and GLUT2 by 
RELM-expands the role of gut hormones in short-term AMPK/ 
protein kinase C mediated control of energy balance. Diabetes 
SGLT-1 activity induced by glucose. The activation of 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to 
downregulate SGLT-1 transport and upregulate glucose 
uptake by GLUT2 (20). The in vitro and in situ experiments 
performed with rat jejunal segments indicate that RELM-
increases transepithelial glucose transport by switching 
the active transport into passive entry. The mechanism 
involved activation of AMPK and protein kinase C (PKC) 
and an insertion of GLUT2 transporters in jejunal brush 
border membranes (BBMs). These data suggest that 
RELM-, a gut-derived hormone, can directly modulate 
intestinal glucose transport. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS </p>

<p>Male Wistar rats weighing 220 -240 g and male C57BL/6J mice weighing 20 -25 
g were from Centre Elevage Janvier, Le Genest-St. Isle, France. The animals 
had free access to tap water and standard food and were treated in 
accordance with European Community guidelines concerning care and use of 
laboratory animals. 
Glucose tolerance test. Gavages of conscious rats or mice with 1 g of 
glucose per kilogram of body weight were performed after a 16-h fast using a 
D-glucose solution without (control) or with RELM-. The total bolus volume 
for mice and rats was 0.25 ml and 1 ml, respectively, and the amount of 
glucose in each bolus was adjusted for the animal weight. The recombinant 
murine RELM-(18 kDa; PeproTech, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) used was 
highly purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and was endotoxin-
free. RELM-, at a final concentration of 0.1 and 1 nmol/l, results in dose range 
of 0.01-0.1 g/kg of body weight. RELM-is a stable molecule as high 
amounts of the homodimer form have been detected in mice and human stools 
(21). Preliminary experiments showed that the peptide given by gavage was 
found in proximal small intestine after 5 min with a recovery of 70%. Before 
starting the OGTT, blood samples were taken from the tail and fasting blood 
glucose levels (milligram per deciliter) were determined (ACCU-CHEK; Roche 
Diagnostic, Meylan, France). The bleeds were further taken at 15, 30, 60, and 
120 min after oral glucose administration. These experiments were performed 
at least with 6 -10 individual animals. 
Tissue preparation and short-circuit measurement. Rats were fasted for 
16 h and were killed by pentobarbital overdose. The proximal jejunum was 
dissected out and four adjacent samples were mounted in Ussing chambers as 
described previously (22). The tissues were bathed with 4 ml of Krebs-Ringer 
bicarbonate (KRB) solution (pH 7.4) with 10 mmol/l glucose at 37°C. In the 
solution bathing the mucosal side of the tissue, glucose was replaced by 
mannitol. Both solutions were gassed with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . Electrogenic ion 
transport was monitored continuously as short-circuit current (Isc) by using 
an automated voltage clamp apparatus (DVC 1000; WPI, Aston, England) 
linked through a MacLab 8 to a MacIntosh computer. KRB alone (vehicle) or 
containing RELM-(0.001-1 nmol/l) was added in the mucosal bath 2 min 
before a glucose challenge. Carbachol (100 mmol/l) was added at the end of 
each experiment as a control. Further, similar tests were performed with 
RELM-incubated overnight at 4°C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised 
against RELM-. Results were expressed as the intensity of the Isc (A/cm 2 ) 
or as the percentage of the peak Isc obtained after glucose challenge 
(measured after 3 min) over basal Isc (measured just before the addition of 
glucose). 
Transmural transport of hexoses. The experiments were performed using 
jejunal sacs from adult Wistar rats. Animals were fasted for 16 h and were 
killed by pentobarbital overdose. The proximal jejunum was dissected out and 
rinsed in cold saline solution. Jejunal loops (4 cm long) were prepared and 0.5 
ml of KRB solution without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-was inserted 
inside the jejunal lumen. The jejunal loops were incubated for 15 min in 
oxygenized KRB at 37°C and conditions were maintained during hexose 
transport assay. The corresponding jejunal loops were filled with 1 ml of KRB 
solution without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-and containing 0.02 
Ci/ml of the isotopic tracer D-[1-14 C] glucose (49.5 mCi/mmol) and glucose to 
obtain a final concentration of 10, 30, and 100 mmol/l. Similarly, we studied the 
paracellular transport with 30 mmol/l mannitol and the isotopic tracer </p>

<p>D-[1-</p>

<p>14 C] mannitol (59 mCi/mmol) at 0.2 Ci/ml. All the jejunal loops were 
incubated in 10 ml of KRB solution during the indicated time. The radioactivity 
was measured in the collected samples of serosal KRB solution and used to 
calculate glucose or mannitol transport as picomoles per milligram of jejunal 
protein. Five independent experiments were performed and significance is 
expressed as *P 0.05,**P 0.01. 
Western blot analysis. Rats were anesthetized by pentobarbital and lapa-
rotomized for in situ experiments. Three jejunal segments (5 cm long) were </p>

<p>tied and filled with 3 ml of KRB without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-. 
After 3 min of in situ incubation, 3 ml of 60 mmol/l glucose solution were 
injected in the lumen to obtain a final concentration of 30 mmol/l. After a 
further 3 min, these loops were removed and opened along the mesenteric 
border and the mucosa was scraped off on ice with a glass blade. Total cell 
protein extracts and BBMs were prepared from the scrapings as previously 
described (23), and enrichment was estimated by determination of alkaline 
phosphatase activity (20-fold increase of activity in BBMs). Solubilized 
proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and 
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. The 
following rabbit antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution: SGLT-1 (AB 1352; 
Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), GLUT2, PKC II (sc-9117, sc-210; 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu-Bio, France), phospho-AMPK-(Thr172), 
AMPK-(23A3), and phospho-PKC (pan (2531, 2603, 190D10; Cell Signaling 
Technology, Ozyme, France). The intensity of the specific immunoreactive 
bands was quantified using National Institutes of Health Image (Scion, 
Frederick, MD). 
Glucose uptake experiments. Uptake experiments were performed using 
rat intestinal everted rings as previously described (24). Groups of eight 
intestinal rings were incubated at 37°C for 15 min in oxygenized KRB buffer in 
the absence (control) and the presence of RELM-(1 nmol/l) and cytochalasin 
B as indicated. Then the rings were incubated for 2 min in an uptake solution 
corresponding to a KRB buffer containing 30 mmol/l glucose and 0.1 Ci/ml of 
the isotopic tracer D-[1-14 C] glucose. After adding the uptake solution, the 
rings were washed in ice-cold KRB solution, and radioactivity incorporated in 
the tissue was quantified by liquid scintillation. Data were not corrected for 
extracellular substrate because RELM-was found not to affect paracellular 
diffusion. Total protein from homogenized tissue with a Dounce homogenizer 
was determined with bicinchoninic acid reagent from Pierce (Thermo Scien-
tific,  res, France). Results are expressed as micromoles glucose per 
gram of tissue protein. 
Chemicals. Recombinant murine RELM-was purchased from PeproTech 
(Neuilly-sur-Seine, France). Antibody raised against RELM-was a gift from 
Dr. Blagoy Blagoev (University of Southern Denmark). D-[1-14 C] Mannitol was 
from GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences (les Ulis, France), D-[1-14 C] 
glucose was from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA), and compound C from Merck 
Sharp &amp; Dohme-Chibret (Paris, France). All other chemical reagents were 
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 
Statistical analysis. All results were expressed as means SE. One-way 
ANOVA with Turkey-Kramer multiple comparisons post hoc test was per-
formed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 4.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA)</rs>). The level of significance was set at P 0.05. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Effect of RELM-on glucose tolerance tests. Oral 
administration of RELM-increased glycemia during 
OGTT carried out in mice (Fig. 1A) and rats (Fig. 1B) as 
compared with control groups. The area under the curve 
was significantly (P 0.05) increased in mice when 
RELM-was used at 1 nmol/l and the two doses used (0.1 
and 1 nmol/l) were effective in rats (Fig. 1A and B, insets). 
A similar 15% increase in blood glucose as compared with 
control was observed in both mice and rats. These data 
show that luminal administration of exogenous RELM-is 
active in vivo as previously described (6). 
Mucosal RELM-inhibits Na -dependent glucose 
transport. The route of glucose entry can involve active 
Na -dependent GLUT (SGLT-1) or diffusive transporter 
GLUT2. We used the Ussing chamber to characterize the 
effect of mucosal RELM-on rat intestinal active glucose 
transport (SGLT-1). Rat jejunal mucosa mounted in the 
chamber was allowed to reach a steady state (usually 40 
min). Addition of 10 mmol/l glucose in the mucosal bath 
induced a rise in Isc (maximum after 3 min) representing 
an increase in SGLT-1 activity. Addition of RELM-to the 
mucosal side 2 min before glucose challenge induced a 
marked and dose-dependent inhibition of glucose-induced 
Isc. As shown in Fig. 2A, addition of RELM-to the 
mucosal side inhibited glucose transport by jejunal mu-
cosa in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal inhi-
bition was achieved with 0.1 nmol/l RELM-. The </p>

<p>
concentration that produced a half-maximal inhibition 
(IC 50 ) of glucose transport was 3 pmol/l. Further, an 
overnight incubation of 0.1 nmol/l RELM-with an anti-
body raised against RELM-countered the inhibition of 
glucose-induced Isc by RELM-as shown in Fig. 2B. Next, 
we investigated if the observed inhibition by RELM-was 
associated with an altered abundance of SGLT-1 in jejunal 
BBMs. A typical immunoblot of SGLT-1 protein in BBMs 
after glucose challenge in the presence or the absence of 
RELM-is shown in Fig. 2C. The mean densitometry of 
three separate blots shows that glucose increased the 
amount of SGLT-1 protein in BBMs by 1.5-fold as com-
pared with control. This increase is reduced by half in the 
presence of RELM-. 
RELM-modulates jejunal glucose transport. We 
isolated rat jejunum and performed in vitro studies of 
transmural glucose transport to directly evaluate the effect 
of RELM-on intestinal transport. As shown in Fig. 3A, 
luminal glucose in jejunal loops significantly increased net 
mucosal to serosal glucose flux. A dose-dependent effect 
on glucose transport was observed with increasing glu-
cose concentrations 10, 30, and 100 mmol/l. Further, </p>

<p>RELM-, at 1 nmol/l, significantly enhanced the jejunal 
transport of 10, 30, and 100 mmol/l glucose but not that of 
30 mmol/l mannitol. Thus, increased jejunal glucose trans-
port induced by RELM-is unlikely to have been caused 
by changes in paracellular permeability. This is in line with 
histological studies of the jejunum tissues used in these 
experiments that did not show any visible mucosal dete-
rioration (data not shown). Further, experiments were 
performed to identify if the effect of RELM-implicated 
potential downstream kinases, PKC, and AMPK, which are 
known as key effectors of intestinal glucose transport 
(6,20,23,25). The AMPK inhibitor, compound C, and the 
PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine, inhibited the 30 mmol/l glu-
cose-induced jejunal glucose transport as shown, respec-
tively, in Fig. 3B and C. The insets represent the area under 
the curve of the 30-min glucose transport kinetics. 
RELM-significantly increased glucose transport by ap-
proximately twofold and this effect was blunted by com-
pound C and chelerythrine as shown, respectively, in Fig. 
3B and C. These results indicate a likely involvement of 
PKC and AMPK in the luminal effect of RELM-on glucose 
uptake. 
RELM-stimulates phosphorylation of AMPK and 
translocation of PKC II. The above results prompted 
us to assess by in situ experiments the cellular effects of 
RELM-on AMPK and PKC. Jejunal segments were in-
jected with a KRB solution alone or containing 30 mmol/l 
glucose in the absence and the presence of 1 nmol/l 
RELM-. The mucosal scrapings of jejunum were exam-</p>

mucosa was mounted in Ussing chamber and the increase in Isc was 
studied at steady state. Electrogenic (Na ) transport was followed as 
an index of the active glucose transport by cotransporter SGLT-1. 
RELM-was added in the mucosal bath 2 min before challenging the 
tissues with 10 mmol/l glucose. Values for Isc were standardized to 
control values and expressed as percentage of controls. A: Dose-
dependent inhibition. B: The effect of 0.1 nmol/l RELM-after an

from rat jejunum loops incubated in situ with and without luminal 
RELM-during 6 min. Densitometric analysis of immunoreactive bands 
was performed using National Institutes of Health Image analysis 
program. The densitometry represents the amount of SGLT-1 relative 
to -actin and is representative of at least three separate experiments.

<p>ined by Western blot analysis. The results indicated that 
glucose as well as RELM-stimulated AMPK phosphory-
lation over control values as shown in Fig. 4A. The 
corresponding mean densitometric analysis indicates that 
RELM-induced a threefold increase in AMPK phosphor-
ylation. A further increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK 
occurred when glucose and RELM-were added together. 
Similarly, RELM-induced a threefold increase in PKC 
phosphorylation in line with our data (6) in the mouse 
colon (data not shown). This prompted us to study the 
translocation of cytosolic PKC II of enterocytes to BBMs, 
a mechanism that is associated with intestinal glucose 
transport (20,23). We performed Western blot analysis to 
determine the expression of PKC II in BBMs obtained 
from intestinal segments that were incubated with glucose 
(30 mmol/l) or RELM-(1 nmol/l) as described above. As 
shown in Fig. 4B, RELM-or glucose induced, respec-
tively, 1.5-or 2-fold increase of PKC II at the BBMs as 
compared with control values. A further increase (2.7-fold 
compared with the control) of PKC II at the BBMs was 
observed when RELM-and glucose were added together. 
These results suggest that RELM-stimulates the phos-
phorylation of AMPK and PKC as well as an increased shift 
of PKC II to the BBMs of rat jejunal tissue. 
RELM-increases GLUT2 activity and its expression 
at BBMs. We explored whether RELM-could enhance 
the glucose-induced GLUT2 translocation to the apical 
membrane of enterocytes. To this end, we measured </p>

<p>FIG. 4. RELM-induces phosphorylation of AMPK and translocation of 
PKC II. Rats were anesthetized and their jejunal loops were used for 
in situ experiments. The loops were filled with KRB buffer with or 
without 1 nmol/l RELM-. After 3 min, glucose (30 mmol/l) was added 
in this mucosal bath. After a further 3 min, loops were excised and kept 
on ice before scraping off the mucosa. Total protein extraction and 
BBMs preparation were performed immediately as described in 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS. Representative immunoblots for phospho-
AMPK (A) in mucosal extracts and PKC II (B) in BBMs are shown. 
The densitometry in A represents the amount of phosphorylated

glucose uptake in rat everted jejunal rings in the presence 
of RELM-and without or with cytochalasin B, a compet-
itive inhibitor of GLUT2 (26). As shown in Fig. 5A, 
cytochalasin B inhibited glucose uptake by 50% in agree-
ment with the implication of GLUT2 in glucose uptake 
(27,28). RELM-enhanced glucose uptake by twofold and 
this effect was also strongly inhibited by cytochalasin B. 
Further, we performed Western blot analysis to determine 
the expression of GLUT2 in BBMs obtained from intestinal 
segments that had been incubated with RELM-under the 
same conditions as above. We observed that glucose or 
RELM-alone induced, respectively, a four-or threefold 
increase in the amount of GLUT2 found in the brush-
border fraction, respectively (Fig. 5B). When glucose and 
RELM-were added together, a further increase in the 
amount of GLUT2 was observed (fivefold as compared 
with control). This suggests that RELM-enhanced glu-
cose uptake is a result of an increased insertion of GLUT2 
into the BBMs. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>In the present study, we show that RELM-, a resistin-like 
molecule, can directly increase jejunal absorption of glu-
cose in the rat. Several lines of evidence suggest that 
transepithelial transport of glucose in the small intestine 
can be mediated by an active absorption through Na / 
glucose cotransporter (SGLT-1) as well as by a diffusive 
component GLUT2 at the apical membrane (27). We found 
that RELM-inhibited the activity of SGLT-1, whereas 
enhancing the presence of GLUT2 at the BBM of entero-
cytes. Moreover, the increased jejunal glucose transport 
induced by RELM-was inhibited by cytochalasin B in 
agreement with a functional role of GLUT2. The underly-
ing molecular mechanism involves the activation of PKC 
II and AMPK kinases as described for such reciprocal 
regulation of glucose transporters (20). 
The acute treatment of rat jejunum with RELM-had no 
significant effect on passive mannitol movement suggest-</p>

<p>ing that RELM-increases glucose transport by the use of 
transporters. We found that mucosal RELM-inhibited the 
activity and the translocation of cytosolic SGLT-1 to cell 
membranes. This effect was blunted by an antibody raised 
against RELM-. Other peptides such as leptin, angioten-
sin II, and CCK-8 have also been shown to inhibit SGLT-1 
activity (14,16,28). We show that in contrast to CKK-8, 
which seems to have no effect on GLUT2 (28), RELM-can 
induce GLUT2 translocation. Indeed, in response to 
RELM-the amount of GLUT2 was increased in the BBMs. 
Similarly, a rapid insertion of GLUT2 to apical membrane 
in response to another gut-peptide, GLP-2, has been re-
ported (29,30). Taken together, these findings suggest the 
involvement of GLUT2 in RELM-stimulated glucose 
uptake. 
The mechanisms responsible for RELM-effect may 
involve the activation of PKC (6) and AMPK (25) that have 
been shown to regulate jejunal glucose transporters (20). 
This is sustained by the report that luminal epidermal 
growth factor increases jejunal glucose transport in rabbit 
through PKC activity (31). We found that chelerythrine, an 
inhibitor of PKC, blocked RELM-stimulation of glucose 
uptake. The effect of RELM-is accompanied by an 
increase in the amount of PKC II at the BBMs. The 
activation of PKC has been shown to inhibit SGLT-1 
mediated transport of hexoses (14,32). In oocytes express-
ing rat and rabbit SGLT-1, the activation of PKC decreases 
the maximum rate of transport for both isoforms. This 
change is accompanied by proportional change in the 
number of SGLT-1 molecules at the plasma membrane, 
indicating that PKC regulates endocytosis of the vesicles 
containing the transporter (33). Further, SGLT-1 contains 
a consensus site of PKC phosphorylation and thus PKC 
phosphorylation of the transporter could control its activ-
ity (34). These data are in line with our results showing 
that RELM-inhibits SGLT-1 activity and its translocation 
to BBMs in rat small intestine. 
The activation of AMPK has been shown to downregu-
late SGLT-1-dependent glucose transport but also to 
enhance GLUT2 translocation to the apical membrane of 
the jejunum (20). This effect of AMPK leads to an in-
creased glucose uptake in jejunum (20) as well as in 
muscle (35). Interestingly, several hormones have been 
shown to regulate AMPK in a strictly tissue-specific man-
ner (36). We demonstrate that the compound C blocked 
RELM-stimulation of glucose transport in rat intestine 
suggesting the involvement of AMPK. Humans and rodents 
express two isoforms of the catalytic subunit (1, 2) that 
form the heterotrimeric complex AMPK (, , and ) 
known to serve as a regulator of energy balance (37). We 
showed that RELM-could increase the phosphorylation 
of the conserved threonine residue (Thr-172) of 1 in the 
jejunal mucosa that is crucial for the AMPK activity. As 
evoked above, activated PKC decreases the number of 
SGLT-1 transporters but can also activate the transloca-
tion of GLUT2 to BBMs as described elsewhere (23). Thus, 
luminal RELM-can directly enhance glucose transport by 
mustering GLUT2 at BBMs through PKC and AMPK 
activation. 
This inverse regulation of SGLT-1 and GLUT2 by luminal 
RELM-may be important when enterocytes require en-
ergy as shown in stress-induced pathology (38). The 
energy sensor molecule AMPK as well as PKC can increase 
the GLUT2 energy-independent pathway to override that 
of SGLT-1 that requires energy (20,32). In agreement with 
this concept, the SGLT-1-mediated absorption of nutrients </p>

BBMs. A: Rat jejunal everted rings were incubated in oxygenized KRB 
buffer without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-. The presence of 
cytochalasin B is indicated. The rings were incubated for 2 min in a 
KRB buffer containing 30 mmol/l glucose and 0.1 Ci/ml of the isotopic

<p>such as galactose and glucose is decreased during either 
systemic (39) or intestinal inflammation (40). Further, to 
meet the increased metabolic demand of inflamed tissue, it 
has been shown that proinflammatory cytokines (interleu-
kin [IL]-8, IL-6, and IL-1) can increase jejunal absorption of 
glucose without changes in BBM SGLT-1 content (41). An 
increased expression of RELM-has been described in the 
intestine during jejunal inflammation (19,42,43). The ex-
pression of RELM-is increased by several proinflamma-
tory cytokines and by lipopolysaccharide (9,21) and they 
may act together to modulate intestinal glucose absorp-
tion. Thus, the enhanced glucose absorption by RELM-in 
response to inflammatory stimulus may contribute to the 
associated energy demand. 
Obese and insulin-resistant rodent models that are char-
acterized by a low-grade inflammation are associated with 
an increased expression of the gut-derived RELM-(8). 
Expression of RELM-has been shown in rat (18) and 
mice (19) proximal intestine and the peptide may act 
locally in a paracrine manner or as a circulating hormone 
linking the gut to the liver. When given by gavage, it is 
possible that RELM-could be partly absorbed by the 
small intestine to reach the blood as demonstrated for 
leptin (44). In favor of a hormonal effect, the infusion of 
intestinal RELM-in mice has been shown to promote a 
marked increase in the rate of hepatic glucose production 
(7). This was associated with a rapidly induced hepatic but 
not peripheral insulin resistance. We observed that acute 
RELM-administration in the intestinal lumen of rodents 
resulted in an increased glycemia in OGTT. This could 
result from the observed increased intestinal glucose 
absorption and an acute hepatic insulin resistance (7). 
This is in line with a local intestinal and distant action of 
this gut peptide. As to whether RELM-may also counter-
act the described insulin inhibition of intestinal sugar 
absorption remains to be established (45). There may be 
different RELM-thresholds in insulin target tissues as 
described for resistin (46). A better understanding of 
RELM-action on different tissues could emerge if puta-
tive RELM-receptors were identified. In this context, the 
effect of RELM-may even involve rapid neuronal activa-
tion because RELM family members RELM-(47) and 
RELM-(4) can bind to neurons. Other than short-regula-
tion, RELM-can have a chronic effect as shown in 
diet-induced metabolic disorders (25). Transgenic mice 
over-expressing circulating RELM-exhibited significant 
hyperglycemia, hyperlipedemia when fed on high-fat diet. 
In conclusion, our study shows that RELM-increases 
intestinal glucose transport. Further studies may reveal if 
this process in conjunction with an adverse nutritional and 
inflammatory status, can participate in the onset of 
diabetes. </p>
