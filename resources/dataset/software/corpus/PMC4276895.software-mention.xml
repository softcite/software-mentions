<p>Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is associated with structural alterations of lung vasculature. PAH is still a 
devastating disease needing an aggressive therapeutic approach. Despite the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the molecular parameters to define the stemness remain largely unknown. Using high-
density oligonucleotide microarrays, the differential gene expression profiles between a fraction of mononuclear cells of 
human umbilical cord blood (UCB) and its MSC subpopulation were obtained. Of particular interest was a subset of 46 genes 
preferentially expressed at 7-fold or higher in the group treated with human UCB-MSCs. This subset contained numerous genes 
involved in the inflammatory response, immune response, lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, cell migration, cell differentiation, 
apoptosis, cell growth, transport, cell proliferation, transcription, and signal transduction. Our results provide a foundation for 
a more reproducible and reliable quality control using genotypic analysis for the definition of human UCB-MSCs. Therefore, 
our results will provide a basis for studies on molecular mechanisms controlling the core properties of human MSCs. </p>

<p>Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a progressive 
disease, with an estimated median survival of 2.8 years </p>

<p>cardiomyocytes, or even cells of nonmesodermal derivation, 
including hepatocytes and neurons [7-11]. Although MSC 
were originally isolated from bone marrow [12, 13], similar 
populations have been reported in other tissues. Human MSC 
have now been isolated from adipose tissue [14], umbilical 
cord blood (UCB) [15-18], and peripheral blood [19, 20]. 
Recently, Kogler et al. [18] described a subset of MSC derived 
from human CB which they called ''unrestricted somatic 
stem cells. '' All of the research demonstrated that variations 
in conditions had a significant impact on the potential of the 
populations generated, even though the initial cell material 
could be phenotypically identical. MSC have been defined 
by plastic adherent growth and subsequent expansion under 
specific culture conditions, by a panel of nonspecific surface 
antigens, and by in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential 
[21]. However, the lack of common standards and of a precise 
definition of initial cell preparations remains a major obstacle 
for the research and applications of MSC. In the present 
study, MSC isolated from UCB were used to treat PAH rats, 
and the genome-wide expression profiles were compared. 
The advantage of DNA microarray analysis is that it can 
simultaneously evaluate changes in the relative expression of 
thousands of genes [22-24]. The purpose of this study was 
to investigate the changes of gene expression by microarray 
analysis after the injection of human UCB-MSCs into 
monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rats. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods </p>

<p>Animals and treatment </p>

<p>Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 
approximately 180-220 g, were used for this study. All rats 
were housed in climate-controlled conditions with a 12 
hour light/12 hour dark cycle, and had free access to food 
and water [25]. Pulmonary hypertension was induced by 
subcutaneous injection of 60 mg/kg MCT (Sigma Chemicals, 
St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in 0.5 N HCl solution. The rats 
were grouped as follows: control group (n=12), subcutaneous 
injection of saline (0.1 ml/kg); M group (n=12), subcutaneous 
injection of MCT; U group, human UCB-MSCs transfusion 
(n=12). Human UCB-MSCs (3×10 </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>/ml/cm </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>) were transfused 
by external jugular vein administered 1 week after MCT 
injection. The animals were sacrificed in 4 weeks after human 
UCB-MSCs transfusion. The rats were anesthetized by Zoletil 
50 (30 mg/kg, Virbac, Carros Cedex, France) and Rompun 
(10 mg/kg, Bayer Korea Ltd., Seoul, Korea). Lung tissues </p>

<p>were removed and immediately for microarray analysis. All 
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committees of the School of Medicine of Ewha Womans 
University (approval number 11-0169). </p>

<p>Cell preparation </p>

<p>Human UCB-MSCs were obtained from Medipost Inc. 
(Biomedical Research Institute Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) and 
isolated human MSCs were expanded in culture according 
to the method of previous report [26]. Briefly, mononuclear 
cells isolated from UCB were washed, suspended in alpha-
minimum essential medium (Gibco-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(Gibco-Invitrogen, Grand island, NY, USA). Human UCB-
MSCs were adherent to plastic culture dishes during the 
culture period and showed spindle-shaped fibroblast-like 
morphology at passage 5. </p>

<p>RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis </p>

<p>Total RNA was extracted from the lung sample that stored 
for 24 hours at room temperature and then in the fridge 
(-20°C) using a PAXgene lung RNA extraction kit according 
to the manufacturer's instructions. Each total RNA sample 
(1 μg) was labeled and amplified using Universal Linkage 
System aRNA labeling kit (Kreatech Diagnostics, Amsterdam, 
Netherlands). </p>

<p>Microarray analysis </p>

<p>Each total RNA sample (100 ng) was labeled and 
amplified using Low Input Quick Amp labeling kit (Agilent 
Technologies, CA, USA). The Cy3-labeled aRNAs were 
resuspended in 50 ml of hybridization solution (Agilent 
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). After labeled aRNAs 
were placed on Agilent SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8X60K array 
(Agilent Technologies) and covered by a Gasket 8-plex slide 
(Agilent Technologies). The slides were hybridized for 17 
hours at 65°C oven. The hybridized slides were washed in 
2× saline sodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate 
for 2 minutes, 1× SSC for 3 minutes, and then 0.2× SSC for 2 
minutes at room temperature. The slides were centrifuged at 
3,000 rpm for 20 seconds to dry. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis </p>

<p>The arrays were analyzed using an Agilent scanner with 
associated software. Gene expression levels were calculated 
with <rs id="software-1" type="software">Feature Extraction</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">v10.7.3.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Agilent Technologies</rs>). </p>

<p>www.acbjournal.org </p>

<p>Relative signal intensities for each gene were generated 
using the Robust Multi-Array Average algorithm. The data 
were processed based on quantile normalization method 
using the <rs id="software-2" type="software">GeneSpring GX</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">11.5.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Agilent Technologies</rs>). 
This normalization method aims to make the distribution 
of intensities for each array in a set of arrays the same. The 
normalized, and log transformed intensity values were then 
analyzed using <rs id="software-3" type="software">GeneSpring GX</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">11.5.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Agilent Technologies</rs>). 
Fold change filters included the requirement that the genes be 
present in at least 200% of controls for up-regulated genes and 
lower than 50% of controls for down-regulated genes. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Comparison of microarray analysis between the M 
group and the control group </p>

<p>The expressions of 393 genes in the M treatment group 
were significantly different to those of the control group. M </p>

<p>treatment showed a 1.5-fold increase in the expression of 
1,996 genes (two-fold increase in the expression of 557 genes) 
and 1.5-fold decrease in the expressions of 1,797 genes (two-
fold decrease in the expression of 563 genes) compared to 
the control group (Table 1). Among the up-regulated genes 
(Table 2), four genes (Lipase, Cytochrome P450, Acyl-CoA 
thioesterase 1, and Apolipoprotein C-l) were related to lipid 
metabolism, seven were related to transport (Aquaporin 3 
[Aqp3], Rh-associated glycoprotein, Adducin 2 beta, Solute 
carrier family 4, Globin alpha, Solute carrier family 10, and 
Potassium voltage-gated channel), and fourteen were related 
to signal transduction (Olfactory receptor 1584 [Olr1584], 
Glucagon receptor, Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, and 
Neuropeptide Y receptor Y1). Galanin prepropeptide (Gal) 
was related to apoptosis, and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase 
(Alox15b) was related to cell growth. Three genes (Hemogen 
[Hemgn], Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 
16 [Zbtb16], Kohjirin [Chrdl1]) were related to cell 
differentiation, and two were related to transcription (cAMP 
responsive element binding protein 3-like 3 [Creb313], 
Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 [Nr1d1]). 
Twenty one genes were down-regulated in the M group 
compared with the control group (Table 3). Among the 
down-regulated genes, six genes (Synaptotagmin-like 4 [Sytl4], 
Solute carrier family 7, member 10 [Slc7a10], Gap junction 
protein, beta 1 [Gjb1], Neuromedin U receptor 1 (Nmur1), </p>

human UCB-MSCs by flow cytometry was performed with 
cultured cells. </p>

<p>The genes that showed differential expression by more than 
2.0-fold (P&lt;0.05) in at least one sample are shown in Figs. 2 
and 3. The red color indicates over expression, while green 
indicates under expression (Fig. 4). Through microarray 
analysis, changes in the expression of genes associated with 
inflammatory response, immune response, lipid metabolism, 
cell adhesion, cell migration, cell differentiation, apoptosis, 
cell growth, transport, cell proliferation, transcription, and 
signal transduction were observed. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>In this study, it was demonstrated that human UCB-MSCs 
(3×10 </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>/ml/cm </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>) which were injected via the external jugular 
vein were engrafted in the lung tissues of MCT-induced PAH 
rats. Adverse effects were not observed after the transfusion </p>

<p>of human UCB-MSCs. We have demonstrated changes of 
gene expressions after bone marrow cell transfusion in MCT 
model of PAH in our previous study [27] and confirmed in 
the present study. Previously, Umar et al. [28], also reported 
the application of MSCs from donor rats with PAH reduces 
RV pressure overload, RV dysfunction, and lung pathology in 
recipient rats with PAH. Several studies have suggested that 
immune activation and the secretion of cytokines contribute 
to the pathogenesis of PAH [29-32]. Although the etiology 
of PAH remains unknown despite extensive investigation, 
the incidence of PAH patients continues to increase in many 
countries [33-36]. There is no doubt that human UCB-MSCs 
have therapeutic utility in the treatment of PAH. Infusion 
of high doses of human UCB-MSCs effectively reduces 
systemic inflammation and prevents the development of lung 
lesions in PAH. Several mechanisms may explain the anti-
inflammatory effects of human UCB-MSCs in this disease 
[37-39]. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the 
therapeutic effects of human UCB-MSCs, the gene expression 
profiles of lung tissue obtained 4 weeks after the injection 
of human UCB-MSCs in PAH rats were examined. The 
advantage of DNA microarray is that it can simultaneously 
evaluate changes in the relative expression of thousands of 
genes [22-24]. To gain further insight into the mechanism 
of human UCB-MSCs related to immune processes and 
genetic factors, the difference of gene expression between 
the groups injected with human MSCs and UCB-MSCs, the 
M group and the U group, were investigated. In addition, 
the difference of gene expression levels after human UCB-
MSCs therapy was compared to identify potential candidate 
genes that might link the systemic immune response to 
the development of PAH disease by examining the gene 
expression patterns between the M group and the U group in 
PAH rats. In the present study, many immunologic processes 
and genetic factors were attributed to the pathogenesis of 
PAH. Immunologic abnormalities in the M group of PAH 
rats reflected marked activation of the immune system, 
leading to increased cytokine production. The data indicated 
that there were several genes with differential expression 
in the U group compared to the M group. The change in 
expression levels of several genes were confirmed after the 
injection of human UCB-MSCs. These genes were related to 
inflammatory response, immune response, lipid metabolism, 
cell adhesion, cell migration, cell differentiation, apoptosis, 
cell growth, transport, cell proliferation, transcription, and 
signal transduction. </p>

<p>Previous reports suggested that naive or gene-modified 
endothelial progenitors from peripheral blood or bone 
marrow can ameliorate some of the symptoms of MCT-
induced pulmonary hypertension [40, 41]. In the investigation 
of PAH, gene microarrays have been employed in a variety 
of study designs performed on a diverse array of cell types 
and animal species. Animal microarray studies have been 
performed on both whole lung tissue and microdissected 
pulmonary vasculature of hypoxic and MCT-induced PAH 
[42, 43]. These studies have employed "hypothesis-building" 
strategies, helping to focus attention on potentially novel 
pathologic pathways. However, gene expression has also been 
utilized as a biomarker, potentially useful in the classification 
or identification of an individual's risk of disease [44]. 
Examination of gene expression profiling from the lungs of 
two genetically engineered mouse models provided important 
clues into the pathogenesis of transforming growth factor α 
(TGF-α)-induced pulmonary fibrosis and disruption of the 
BMPR2 pathway. The work by Hardie et al. [45]. utilized 
an advanced tetracycline-inducible transgenic induction of 
TGF-α with lung specificity. 
To define of PAH genes, the scleroderma group was 
subcategorized into mild and severe. Genes that appeared 
to correlate with severity of disease included ILA, vascular 
endothelial growth factor, interleukin-β, and matrix 
metalloproteinase 9. Moreover, confirmation of previously 
differentially expressed genes by the study of Bull et al. [22] 
included ADM, IL7R, ZFP36, GLUL, JUND, and BCL6. 
To create effective and reliable cell-based therapies for 
pulmonary hypertension, it is important to clearly identify 
the population or subpopulations of nonhematopoietic stem 
or progenitor cells that contribute to particular tissues that 
provide large numbers of reparative cells while maintaining 
their differentiation capacity and ability to durably engraft in 
vivo [46]. Despite the injection of human UCB-MSCs into 
MCT-induced PAH rats, relatively little is yet known about 
the relationship between the pulmonary hypertension and 
MSCs. Therefore, in the current study, we was to investigate 
the changes of gene expression by microarray analysis after 
the injection of human UCB-MSCs into MCT-induced PAH 
rats. Many studies estimated that many of the patients do not 
respond to a single injection of human UCB-MSCs, and the 
risk of aneurysm formation is higher in the unresponsive 
group than among rats who defervesce completely after a 
single injection of human UCB-MSCs. The limitations of the 
present study were as follows. The sample size was small, and </p>

<p>further analysis with larger samples of other independent sets 
as well as specific samples such as peripheral blood T cells, 
monocytes/macrophages would be needed to confirm the 
results of human UCB-MSCs injection. </p>
