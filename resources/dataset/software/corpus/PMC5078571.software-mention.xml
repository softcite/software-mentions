<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children and young 
adults. TBI is an example of a medical condition where there are still major lacks in diagnostics and outcome pre-
diction. Here we apply comprehensive metabolic profiling of serum samples from TBI patients and controls in 
two independent cohorts. The discovery study included 144 TBI patients, with the samples taken at the time of 
hospitalization. The patients were diagnosed as severe (sTBI; n = 22), moderate (moTBI; n = 14) or mild TBI 
(mTBI; n = 108) according to Glasgow Coma Scale. The control group (n = 28) comprised of acute orthopedic 
non-brain injuries. The validation study included sTBI (n = 23), moTBI (n = 7), mTBI (n = 37) patients and con-
trols (n = 27). We show that two medium-chain fatty acids (decanoic and octanoic acids) and sugar derivatives 
including 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid are strongly associated with severity of TBI, and most of them are also de-
tected at high concentrations in brain microdialysates of TBI patients. Based on metabolite concentrations from 
TBI patients at the time of hospitalization, an algorithm was developed that accurately predicted the patient out-
comes (AUC = 0.84 in validation cohort). Addition of the metabolites to the established clinical model (CRASH), 
comprising clinical and computed tomography data, significantly improved prediction of patient outcomes. The 
identified 'TBI metabotype' in serum, that may be indicative of disrupted blood-brain barrier, of protective phys-
iological response and altered metabolism due to head trauma, offers a new avenue for the development of diag-
nostic and prognostic markers of broad spectrum of TBIs. 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability 
worldwide (Maas et al., 2008), especially in children and young adults. </p>

<p>Classical approaches to grading TBI rely on the Glasgow coma score 
(GCS) (Saatman et al., 2008) and neuroimaging, but this classification 
takes no account of mechanistic heterogeneity or addresses emerging 
approaches to precision medicine (Maas et al., 2015). 
TBI is associated with a complex metabolic disruption that results in 
energy crisis and energy failure, which is the consequence of multiple 
mechanisms, including classical ischaemia (Coles et al., 2004), diffusion 
hypoxia (Menon et al., 2004), mitochondrial dysfunction (Lakshmanan  et al., 2010) and increased energy needs (from excitotoxicity, seizure ac-
tivity and spreading depolarization) (Timofeev et al., 2011). Thus far, </p>

<p>the only approaches to examine this metabolic dysregulation have in-
volved the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain microdialysis, 
arteriojugular venous differences, or advanced metabolic imaging with 
positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging 
and spectroscopy (MRIS), none of which are universally available, and 
are particularly problematic in less severe TBI. Since metabolic dysregu-
lation is such a fundamental facet of TBI pathophysiology, these meta-
bolic changes may contain prognostic information, and early changes 
may provide a useful summary of the pre-hospital and early hospital 
physiological insults experienced by the brain. The broad assumption 
has been that these metabolic changes are the consequence of metabol-
ic failure -but there is the possibility that some may be causes as well as 
consequences of the pathophysiology observed. In addition, release of 
brain specific metabolites (i.e. small molecules with molecular mass 
under 500 Da) into the systemic circulation may provide information 
on blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, a fundamental process in 
TBI (Saw et al., 2014). 
Several peptide or protein based biomarkers for TBI have been pro-
posed. These include S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B), neuron-
specific enolase, myelin basic protein, creatine kinase brain isoenzyme, 
glial fibrilary acidic protein, plasma DNA, brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor, and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 (Berger et al.,  2006; Ingebrigtsen and Romner, 2002; Mondello et al., 2011; Papa et  al., 2010; Pelinka et al., 2004; Vos et al., 2004). However, most of these 
biomarkers lack the disease specificity. For example, protein S100B, 
the most extensively studied biomarker of TBI, has been reported to 
be released into the serum also after experimental ischemic injury to 
the liver, kidney, and the gut (Pelinka et al., 2004). Moreover, its levels 
have been found to have increased also after exercise (Koh and Lee,  2014), extracranial trauma (Savola et al., 2004) and burns (Anderson  et al., 2001) and it has also been suggested as a biomarker of melanoma 
(Torabian and Kashani-Sabet, 2005). 
Here we hypothesized that metabolites may be a rich source of cir-
culating TBI biomarkers. We applied comprehensive metabolic profiling 
of serum samples from TBI patients and controls comprised of acute or-
thopedic non-brain injuries in two independent cohorts, with the aims 
(a) to associate metabolite profiles with TBI severity and (b) to predict 
the outcomes of TBI patients. </p>

<p>2. Materials and Methods </p>

<p>2.1. Ethics Statement </p>

<p>South-West Finland Hospital District Research Ethics Committee, 
the Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee, and the Norfolk 
Research Ethics Committee approved the protocol. All patients or 
their next of kin were given both oral and written information 
about the study and a written informed consent was obtained. All pa-
tients were treated according to standard local guidelines based on </p>

<p>the current international guidelines and recommendations (Brain  Trauma Foundation et al., 2007). </p>

<p>2.2. Study Population and Clinical Assessment </p>

<p>Patient recruitment of this prospective multicenter study was part of 
the EU funded TBIcare (Evidence-based Diagnostic and Treatment Plan-
ning Solution for Traumatic Brain Injuries) project. A total of 389 adult 
patients with acute TBI and 81 patients with acute orthopedic trauma 
without acute or previous brain disorders, who served as controls, 
were prospectively recruited at Turku University Hospital (Turku, 
Finland) and at Addenbrooke's Hospital (Cambridge, United Kingdom). 
211 patients with acute TBI and 55 orthopedic trauma patients had eli-
gible serum samples available (Table 1). 
Inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18 years (≥ 16 years in United King-
dom), clinical diagnosis of TBI and indications for acute head computed 
tomography according to National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence (NICE) criteria (http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg176). Exclu-
sion criteria were: blast-induced or penetrating injury, chronic 
subdural hematoma, inability to live independently due to pre-existing 
brain disease, TBI or suspected TBI not needing head computed tomog-
raphy, more than two weeks from the injury, not speaking native lan-
guage, and no consent obtained. The control group comprised patients 
with acute orthopedic non-trivial trauma without any signs of acute 
central nervous system involvement, previous central nervous system 
disease, or previous non-concussional TBI. 
Two separate sample cohorts were utilized in this study (Turku and 
Cambridge studies, respectively). Blood samples for metabolomic anal-
ysis (2 ml) were collected within 12 h after hospital admission. After 
sampling, the samples were allowed to clot for 30 min at +4°C before 
centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. After centrifugation the 
serum was divided into five aliquots and immediately frozen at −70°C. 
Cerebral microdialysis was undertaken using a CMA71, 100 kDa molec-
ular weight cut-off catheter (M Dialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden), via a 
cranial access device (Technicam, Newton Abbot, United Kingdom), 
perfused at 0.3 ml/min using a CMA106 pump (M Dialysis AB). The per-
fusate consisted of CNS perfusion fluid (M Dialysis AB). 
The severity of TBI was classified on the basis of Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) (Saatman et al., 2008). GCS 13-15 was considered mild, 9-12 
moderate and 3-8 severe. GCS scores in the scene of accident assessed 
by paramedics or an emergency physician were retrieved from the am-
bulance sheets. GCS scores at emergency departments were assessed on 
admission. Lowest recorded GCS before intubation and sedation from 
the scene of accident or emergency department was used in the statis-
tical analysis. 
Outcomes were assessed at 3 months in patients with mild TBI 
(Cambridge) and at 6-12 months (all other patients) after the injury 
using Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSe), which divides patients 
with TBI into groups allowing the standardized assessment of their </p>

classified as favorable outcome, and GOSe score 1-4 was classified as 
unfavorable outcome. </p>

<p>2.3. Metabolomic Analysis </p>

<p>Metabolomic analyses of serum and brain microdialysate samples 
were performed at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland (Espoo,  Finland). Additional analyses to identify metabolites of interest were 
also performed at LECO Corporation (St. Joseph, Michigan) and Steno 
Diabetes Center (Gentofte, Denmark). 
Serum samples (30 μl) or microdialysate samples (100 μl) were 
spiked with 10 μl of internal standard mixture (C17:0 (186,5 mg/l), deu-
terated valine (37 mg/l) and succinic acid-d4 (63 mg/l). The protein 
precipitation was done as follows: 400 μl of methanol was added 
and then the samples were vortexed for 2 min. After centrifugation 
(5 min at 7800 g at room temperature) and settling for 30 min at 
− 20°C the supernatant was evaporated to dryness under gentle 
flow of nitrogen before derivatization. The original metabolites 
were then converted into their methoxime and trimethylsilyl (TMS) 
derivatives by two-step derivatization. First, 25 μl of methoxyamine 
hydrochloride (98%) was added to the residue, and the mixture was 
incubated for 60 min at 45°C. Next, 25 μl of N-methyl-N-
trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide was added, and the mixture was 
incubated for 60 min at 45°C. Finally, a retention index standard 
mixture (n-alkanes, 25 μl, c = 8 mg/l) and an injection standard (4,4′-
dibromooctafluorobiphenyl, 50 μl, c = 10 mg/l), both in hexane, were 
added to the mixture. 
GC × GC-TOFMS analyses were carried out on an Agilent 6890 gas 
chromatograph equipped with a split/splitless injector (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA), cryogenic dual-stage modulator and time-
of-flight mass spectrometer (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA). In addi-
tion, multipurpose sampler with Maestro software (Gerstel, Mülheim 
an der Ruhr, Germany) was used for derivatization and sample intro-
duction. A 10 m × 0.18 mm I.D. Rxi-5 ms (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, 
USA) column with film thickness 0.18 μm was used as the first column 
and a 1.5 m × 0.1 mm I.D. BPX-50 (SGE Analytical Science, Austin, TX, 
USA) column with film thickness of 0.1 μm as the second column. A phe-
nyl methyl deactivated retention gap column (1.5 m × 0.53 mm I.D.) 
was installed in front of the first column. The injector was used in the 
splitless mode at 240°C for injecting 1 μl of a sample. The splitless period 
was 90 s. High-purity helium (Aga, Espoo, Finland) was used as the car-
rier gas in a constant-pressure mode with initial pressure of 276 kPa. 
The first column oven temperature program was as follows: 50°C (iso-
thermal for 2 min) then 7°C/min to 240°C, and, finally, 25°/min to 
300°C (3 min). The second dimension column oven temperature was 
maintained 20°C higher and the programming rate and hold times 
were similar than in the first dimension. The temperature of the transfer 
line was maintained at 260°C and ion source at 200°C. Modulation time 
was 4 s. Electron impact ionization was applied at 70 eV, and the mass 
range from 45 to 700 amu with 100 spectra/s was measured. 
Automatic peak detection and mass spectrum deconvolution were 
performed using a peak width set to 0.2 s. Peaks with signal-to-noise 
(S/N) values lower than 100 were rejected. The S/N values were based 
on the masses chosen by the software for quantification. <rs id="software-1" type="software">ChromaTOF</rs> 
version <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">4.32</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">LECO Corporation</rs>, St. Joseph, MI) was used for the raw 
data processing. The peak areas from total ion chromatography (TIC) 
were used for most of the compounds; for compounds that were quan-
tified with the <rs type="software">ChromaTOF</rs> software, peak areas of selected characteris-
tic m/z were used. 
Next, the data files obtained by the <rs type="software">ChromaTOF</rs> software were 
exported to text files and in-house developed software <rs id="software-3" type="software">Guineu</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Castillo</rs> et al., 2011) was used for aligning and normalization of com-
pounds for further analyses. The original GC × GC-TOFMS data includes 
retention times, retention indices (RI), spectral information (for possi-
ble identification), spectral similarity value (S = 0-999), and peak </p>

<p>response data. The linear retention indices were calculated based on 
the total (i.e., sum of the first and the second dimension) retention 
times of the compounds and the retention times of the retention 
index standards (n-alkanes). The second dimension retention time is 
so short (1-3.5 s) that its contribution to the retention index is not sig-
nificant. The alignment of the data was performed based on retention 
indices, second dimension retention times and spectra. After alignment 
of the GC × GC-TOFMS data, two filtration criteria was utilized for pos-
itive identification: spectral similarity N850 and maximum allowed dif-
ference in retention index between experimental and literature values 
b25. Only the metabolites detected in over 70% of the samples in each 
of the four study groups were included in the dataset. This procedure re-
sulted in a total of 465 metabolites. The literature values were obtained 
from NIST 2008 Mass Spectral Library or they were determined experi-
mentally with GC × GC-TOFMS instrument in our laboratory with au-
thentic standards (in-house developed library). In addition, Golm 
metabolome database (Kopka et al., 2005) was used for further identifi-
cation of the metabolites. In cases where the metabolite identity could 
not be determined with available methods, the chemical class was re-
ported based on the MS spectra (Castillo et al., 2011). 
The validation and discovery cohorts were analyzed separately. 
The orders of both sample preparation and analysis were randomized, 
and a set of controls samples (pooled serum samples), standards 
and blank samples (solvent blank) was analyzed together with the 
samples. In the discovery set, the day-to-day variation of internal 
standards added to all samples was on average 17.3% and the day-to-
day variation in control serum samples (n = 31) of the quantified 
metabolites was 18.0%. In the validation set, the variation of internal 
standards added to all samples was on average 12.3% and the variation 
of control serum samples (n = 14) of the quantified metabolites was 
9.2%. </p>

<p>2.4. Data Filtering </p>

<p>Most severe TBI patients, as well as several moderate and mild TBI 
patients and a few controls have been given propofol. Propofol was 
detected at low concentrations. However, one phase two metabolite 
of propofol (propofol glucuronide) was detected in relatively high 
concentrations. The identification was further verified by liquid chro-
matography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Possible 
correlation of propofol metabolites with other metabolites was also 
checked using Pearson correlation, showing correlation with unknown 
compounds that were structurally similar to the identified propofol me-
tabolites, and a few additional metabolites. Three compounds that had 
similar mass spectra to propofol glucuronide and which showed high 
correlation (r N 0.7, p b 0.05) with the compound were removed from 
the data. Ibuprofen was also detected in several control samples and 
was removed from the dataset. </p>

<p>2.5. Statistical Analyses </p>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB R2014b (The 
MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), applying in-house developed scripts 
and <rs id="software-5" type="software">PLS Toolbox</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">7.9</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Eigenvector Research, Inc</rs>., Wenatchee, WA, USA), 
and <rs type="software">R</rs> Statistical Software using rms package (Harrell, 2015). 
The zero values in the metabolomics dataset were first imputed. For 
each metabolite, zero value was replaced by half the minimum non-
zero value of the metabolite across all samples. Due to the non-normal 
distribution of data, data were then log-transformed. The mean levels 
of the four study groups were compared using ANOVA on all 465 metab-
olites. In order to adjust for multiple testing, False Discovery Rates (FDR) 
were calculated (Storey, 2002), with FDR q-values b0.05 considered 
significant. The mean levels of each of the three TBI groups (mild, mod-
erate, and severe) were compared to the control group using two-sided 
t-test (unequal variance). </p>

<p> 
M. Orešič et al. / EBioMedicine 12 (2016) 118-126 </p>

<p>A principal component analysis (PCA) model was calculated based 
on the 172 subjects from the Turku cohort and 98 metabolites selected 
using ANOVA and FDR related to control/mild/moderate/severe sub-
jects. Data were autoscaled and the model consisted of seven principal 
components. No potential confounding factors, such as age and gender, 
affected the model in the major components. In the fifth principal com-
ponent there was a slight age drift. Correcting for this drift by orthogo-
nalization did not change the outcome of the model in relation to the 
severity status; hence age does not affect the coherence of the metabo-
lites related to the severity of TBI. </p>

<p>2.6. Prediction of Patient Outcomes -Multivariate Metabolite Model </p>

<p>1000 prediction models were built using partial least squares dis-
criminant analysis (PLS-DA). However, PLS-DA is sensitive to a skewed 
dataset and therefore 33 subjects were randomly selected out of the 99 
good outcome subjects in each of the 1000 models in order to align with 
the 33 poor outcome subjects. 49 metabolites were included in the anal-
yses; these were also selected using ANOVA and FDR related to good/ 
poor outcome of the subjects. Data were mean centered. The models 
were cross-validated using random cross-validation with 10 splits and 
10 iterations. During model optimization, metabolites were selected in 
two runs as being most important based on variables influence in pro-
jection (VIP) with values in the first run above 1 and in the second 
run above 0.75. The most abundant metabolites present in N 750 of the 
1000 PLS-DA models comprised eight metabolites out of the 49 metab-
olites included in the analyses. </p>

<p>2.7. Prediction of Patient Outcomes -Combined Clinical and Metabolite 
Model </p>

<p>The additional predictive value of the metabolites over known clin-
ical predictors was assessed with ordinal multivariable regression. Out-
comes were assessed at three months in patients with mild TBI 
(Cambridge) and at 6-12 months (all other patients) after the injury 
with GOSe. The first model contained the clinical predictors age, pupil 
reactivity, Glasgow Coma Scale at admission, CT characteristics (Mar-
shall CT classification), and extracranial injury (Injury Severity Score). 
Selection of these predictors was based on the CRASH prediction 
model (MRC Crash Trial Collaborators et al., 2008) but limited to the 
availability of variables in our data. 
Model 2 contained the same clinical predictors, and the top ranking 
metabolites were added (top ranking metabolites based on FDR q-value, 
comparing favorable (GOSe N4). and unfavorable (GOSe ≤4) outcomes). 
Both models were fitted on the Turku cohort, internally validated using 
a bootstrap procedure and subsequently externally validated on the 
Cambridge cohort. The best combination of metabolites together with 
the clinical predictors was selected recursively, initially starting with 
the top ranking metabolite, then adding additional metabolites to the 
model, until the predictive performance started to decrease due to the 
model complexity. 
Missing clinical predictors were imputed with multiple imputation 
based on the predictors and outcome, using the AregImpute function 
in R. All subsequent analyses were performed on the 10 imputed 
datasets and results were pooled in one summary estimate. Models 
were compared in terms of the AUC curve. </p>

<p>3. Results </p>

<p>3.1. Serum Metabolites Associate With Severity of TBI </p>

<p>We evaluated serum metabolomic profiles from 144 TBI patients 
from Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. The samples were 
taken at the time of hospitalization (arrival samples), which was up to 
12 h after the injury. The patients were diagnosed as severe (sTBI; 
n = 22), moderate (moTBI; n = 14) or mild TBI (mTBI; n = 108) </p>

<p>according to their lowest recorded pre-intubation Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) (Saatman et al., 2008) from the scene of accident or emergency 
department. Additionally, the control group (n = 28) comprised of 
acute orthopedic non-brain injuries (Fig. 1, Table 1). The established 
metabolomics platform based on two-dimensional gas chromatography 
coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) (Castillo  et al., 2011) was applied to analyze the serum samples. A total of 465 
metabolites were included in the analysis. Among those were amino 
acids, sugar derivatives, hydroxyl acids, fatty acids as well as sterols 
and related metabolites. 
In the arrival samples, 98 metabolites showed significant differences 
between the four study groups in the Turku cohort (ANOVA, FDR 
q b 0.05) (Supplemental Table 1). Since the patients could not be con-
trolled for confounding factors such as dietary status, alcohol use and 
age, we studied the associations of metabolome with severity of TBI 
only for these 98 top ranking metabolites. Principal component analysis 
(PCA) showed that the differences between cases and controls were 
most pronounced for the severe and moderate TBI patients, while the 
differences were smaller in the mild TBI patients (Fig. 2a, b). None of 
the potential confounding factors explained the differences between 
the study groups (Materials and Methods). We also specifically studied 
the effect of gender on metabolite levels in the control group, due to dif-
ferent gender distributions between the control and TBI groups (Table 
1). We found no significant associations between the 98 top ranking 
metabolites and gender (FDR q N 0.25 for all 98 TBI-associated metabo-
lites; two-sided t-test, unequal variance). 
Metabolite concentrations were highly similar in severe and moder-
ate TBI patients as compared to controls (Fig. 2c). Two medium-chain 
fatty acids (FA), octanoic acid (OA) and decanoic acid (DA), 2-and 3-
hydroxybutyric acids as well as several sugar-derived metabolites 
were upregulated in sTBI. Among these sugar derivatives, we identified 
a metabolite 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-BPG), a key regulator 
of oxygen release to the tissues (Hsia, 1998), which was strongly 
associated with severity of TBI. 2,3-BPG was about 100-fold upregulated 
in sTBI and moTBI as compared to controls. However, the levels of 2,3-
BPG was approaching normal levels during the first 24 h, unlike 
for OA and DA, that remained high in most patients during the first 
week following the injury (Supplemental Fig. 1). Some metabolites, in-
cluding the amino acids serine and alanine, as well as indole-3-
propionic acid (IPA), were downregulated in TBI (Fig. 2c, Supplemental 
Table 1). 
Metabolite levels in mild TBI patients followed the same pattern as 
in more severe TBI, but the magnitude of change as compared to con-
trols was clearly less than e.g. in sTBI (Fig. 2d). Taken together, these 
data suggest that TBI is characterized by a specific 'TBI metabotype', 
but the degree of metabolite changes as compared to their normal levels 
is proportional to the severity of TBI. </p>

<p>3.2. Administration of Propofol Does not Associate With Observed Metabolic 
Profiles in TBI Patients </p>

<p>The propofol vehicle contains predominantly long-chain FAs, mainly 
stearic acid, and it is known that propofol may inhibit mitochondrial 
entry of long-chain FAs and inhibit the respiratory chain (Wolf et al.,  2001). Although the propofol and related metabolites were removed 
from the dataset and the long-chain FAs were not upregulated in the pa-
tients with propofol administration, we examined in more detail the po-
tential association of propofol with the observed changes in medium-
chain FA levels. However, the two significantly upregulated FAs (OA 
and DA) were significantly upregulated also in the severe patients 
(n = 8) who had not been receiving propofol prior to the first sample 
being taken (4.2 and 3.6-fold, p = 0.001 and p = 0.012 for OA and 
DA, respectively). Furthermore, the single control patient who received 
propofol did not show elevated levels of these two FAs. We therefore 
concluded that the propofol administration could not explain the ob-
served upregulation of OA and DA in TBI. </p>

<p>3.3. Validation of Findings in Independent Studies </p>

<p>Next, we compared the TBI metabolite profiles from Turku 
with those from a different population from Addenbrooke's Hos-
pital (Cambridge, United Kingdom). The study group comprised 
sTBI (n = 23), moTBI (n = 7), mTBI (n = 37) patients and controls 
(n = 27), selected using the same inclusion criteria as in the city of 
Turku. The metabolomics data was first aligned with the Turku dataset 
and thus contained a total of 465 metabolites. Out of 98 metabolites 
found significantly associated with TBI in Turku, 44 were found signifi-
cantly different also in the Cambridge dataset, when comparing sTBI pa-
tients and controls (Supplemental Table 2). There was a high degree of 
association between the metabolite levels in sTBI when comparing the 
patients from the two cities (Fig. 3a). No such strong association was 
found in mTBI, which may have been due to the lack of power in a highly 
heterogeneous mTBI population (Supplemental Fig. 2). Notably, the me-
tabolites displaying largest differences between TBI patients and con-
trols in the Turku cohort also behaved similarly in the Cambridge 
cohort, including 2,3-BPG and IPA. 
In order to study the potential relevance of the serum metabolic pro-
files in TBI to brain metabolism, brain microdialysates (BMD) were an-
alyzed from 12 samples acquired from four sTBI patients (Cambridge 
cohort). The top ranking serum metabolites associated with TBI were 
found highly correlated with their levels in BMD (Fig. 3b), which sug-
gests possible disruption of the BBB. Among these metabolites were </p>

<p>sugar derivatives, metabolites related to energy metabolism as well as 
several hydroxy-acids. Notably, the medium-chain FAs (C7-C10) includ-
ing OA and DA were detected at relatively high concentrations in BMD 
as compared to their corresponding concentrations in blood, while the 
long-chain FAs had clearly lower levels in BMD than in blood. </p>

<p>3.4. Serum Metabolites Predict TBI Patient Outcomes </p>

<p>We then investigated if the serum metabolome associates with the 
patient outcomes as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended 
(GOSe) (Wilson et al., 1998). The metabolite levels from patient arrival 
samples in the Turku cohort were compared between patients with un-
favorable outcomes (GOSe ≤4; n = 33) and favorable outcomes (GOSe 
N4; n = 99). Out of 465 metabolites, 49 were significantly different 
between the two outcome groups, most of them up-regulated in poor 
outcome patients (FDR q b 0.05; Supplemental Table 3), and 26 out of 
49 were also significantly different and changed to a similar degree in 
patients in the two outcome categories in the Cambridge cohort 
(Supplemental Fig. 3 and Supplemental Table 4). Only 10 out of 49 me-
tabolites were also among the 98 metabolites that were associated with 
severity of TBI. Interestingly, despite being strongly associated with TBI 
severity, 2,3-BPG was not associated with patient outcomes. 
Based on the metabolomics data from 49 metabolites in the Turku 
cohort, predictive model was developed using the partial least squares 
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (Supplemental Table 5). When tested </p>

<p>in the Cambridge patients with outcome values available (n = 53), the 
model predicted the patient outcomes with good accuracy (AUC = 
0.84; Fig. 4). We also studied the added value of metabolites over the 
established clinical prognostic model CRASH (MRC Crash Trial  Collaborators et al., 2008) using ordinal multivariable regression. The 
models were fitted using the Turku data. In external validation in the </p>

amining the top ranking metabolites together with the CRASH model 
(with metabolites selected based on FDR q-value; Supplemental Table

in external validation setting was achieved for a combination of the clin-
ical model with decanoic acid and pentitol-3-desoxy (AUC = 0.801 in </p>

performance over the clinical model. The retention indices and mass 
spectra for the two metabolites are shown in Supplemental Table 6. 
The predictive performance of a model comprising the two metabolites 
alone was similar as for the clinical model (AUC = 0.740 in external val-
idation). Using the univariate model fitted to Turku data, individual per-
formance of the two selected metabolites as outcome predictors was 
assessed in the validation setting. The two metabolites showed good 
performance, with AUC = 0.648 (p b 0.0001) for decanoic acid and 
AUC = 0.637 (p b 0.0001) for pentitol-3-desoxy. </p>

<p>4. Discussion </p>

<p>Although several circulating peptide or protein based biomarkers for 
TBI have been proposed, these generally lack sensitivity and specificity. 
Here we showed that specific circulating blood metabolites are associat-
ed with severity of TBI as well as predict the patient outcomes. 
We found that two medium-chain fatty acids (OA and DA) are ele-
vated in TBI as well as associated with poor outcomes in TBI patients. 
Medium-chain fatty acids readily penetrate the BBB (Oldendorf, 1973)  and there is evidence that FAs can be transported in both directions 
through the BBB (Spector, 1988). A recent study of free fatty acids in 
plasma and brain, following intravenous human mesenchymal stem 
cells transplantation into rats that had undergone transient middle ce-
rebral artery occlusion, showed upregulation of several FAs in both 
blood and brain, including OA, whereas the levels of long-chain FAs 
were significantly reduced (Paik et al., 2009). Mitochondria play a cru-
cial role in the pathophysiology and energy crisis associated with the 
brain injury. OA and DA provoke mitochondrial dysfunction by acting 
as uncouplers and metabolic inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation 
(Schuck et al., 2009b). Several studies have also shown that DA and OA 
play a role in brain energy metabolism (Ebert et al., 2003) and elicit lipid 
and protein oxidative damage (Green and Reed, 1998; Reis de Assis et  al., 2004; Schuck et al., 2009a). 
The observation of increases in plasma 2,3-BPG in the TBI patients, 
which was unrelated to the patient outcome, is difficult to interpret 
for two reasons. First, blood concentrations of 2,3-BPG are dominated 
by the concentration of this metabolite in red blood cells (RBCs), 
where it acts as an allosteric modulator of oxygen affinity (Hsia, 1998)  and is produced through the effect of BPG mutase on 1,3-BPG (a glyco-
lytic intermediate). It is therefore likely that plasma levels may be influ-
enced by the dominant effects of RBC 2,3-BPG, but the relationship </p>

<p>between the levels of this metabolite in the two compartments is un-
clear. Second, levels of 2,3-BPG in RBCs are modulated by physiological 
influences, including anemia, hypoxia and changes in partial pressure of 
carbon dioxide (PaCO2), all of which are common in TBI. These factors 
make it difficult to identify the drivers of changes in serum 2,3-BPG, 
but may explain why the metabolite had no prognostic relevance. 
Several other metabolites, which are present at high concentrations 
in cerebrospinal fluid (Hartonen et al., 2013) and BMD, were also upreg-
ulated in serum of the TBI patients, indicative of disruption of the BBB. 
These included sugar derivatives, metabolites related to energy metab-
olism as well as several hydroxyl acids. Elevated levels of sugar deriva-
tives are consistent with earlier studies which have shown that 
cerebral glucose metabolism is severely disturbed after TBI (Clausen et  al., 2011; Glenn et al., 2003; Hovda et al., 1992). 
Although multiple amino acids were found to be reduced in the plas-
ma of TBI patients when compared to controls, we were not able to con-
firm earlier findings that the levels of branched chain amino acids 
(BCAAs) are reduced in TBI (Jeter et al., 2013); which may have been 
due to the high variability of BCAA levels due to dietary status not 
being controlled for. The indole derivative IPA, a deamination product 
of tryptophan formed by gut microbiota (Wikoff et al., 2009), was 
downregulated in severe as well as mild TBI patients. IPA has been 
shown to prevent oxidative stress and death of primary neurons and 
neuroblastoma cells exposed to the amyloid beta-protein (Chyan et  al., 1999). IPA also shows a strong level of neuroprotection in two 
other paradigms of oxidative stress (Hwang et al., 2009; Karbownik et  al., 2001). Our findings thus suggest an intriguing possibility that specif-
ic circulating metabolites are transported to the injured brain in order to 
maintain normal brain metabolism. 
The mean age of the patients in Turku cohort was higher than in 
Cambridge cohort. Consequently, the mean GOSe value was lower in 
the Turku cohort, which is in accordance with previously published 
studies reporting that older age predicts poor prognosis in patients 
with TBI (MRC Crash Trial Collaborators et al., 2008; Takala et al.,  2016). The difference in the cohort mean ages likely weakens the total 
accuracy of the predictive outcome model. However, the added value 
of two among the top ranking metabolites from Turku cohort signifi-
cantly augmented the performance of clinical multivariate model 
(CRASH) including age in Cambridge cohort. Considering the discovery 
and validation design of the study comprising two distinct TBI cohorts, 
the metabolite model appears to be potentially valuable in the clinical 
practice. 
As a methodological limitation of the present study, several of the 
metabolites of interest remained unidentified. However, using our ana-
lytical approach (Castillo et al., 2011), we were able to annotate most of 
them by their chemical class. Based on the acquired spectra and chro-
matographic information such as retention indices, these metabolites 
can still be followed-up in the future when better analytical tools and/ 
or spectral library information become available. In order to develop a 
diagnostic assay based on the biomarker panel identified in our study, 
the metabolites will also have to be absolutely quantified and then 
assayed in larger TBI and control populations. This would serve not 
only to validate the findings, but also to derive a more precise diagnostic 
model based on the biomarker panel as well as other relevant clinical in-
formation such as from the CRASH model. 
Taken together, we show that TBI is associated with a specific meta-
bolic profile, which is exacerbated proportionally to the severity of TBI. 
High degree of concentration changes of TBI metabolites in serum as 
well as their proportional enrichment in BMD is indicative of multiple 
underlying mechanisms including potential disruption in BBB as well 
as protective response and altered metabolism due to head trauma. 
Our findings also suggest that these metabolites may exhibit diagnostic 
potential in the full spectrum of TBI. However, further validation studies 
including metabolic profiles in patients with polytrauma are needed to 
find out to what extent the observed results reflect systemic responses 
to severe injury and to what extent they are brain or TBI-specific. </p>
