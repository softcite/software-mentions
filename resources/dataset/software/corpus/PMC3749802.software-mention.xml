<p>The design of experiments (DOE) technique was used to provide 
an efficient means to optimize the process variables of nanopar-
ticles composition. DOE is an approach for effectively and 
efficiently exploring the cause and effect relationship between 
numerous process variables and the output. A sequence of experi-
ments were performed that would yield the most information 
about the factors and their interactions in as few experiments as 
possible. A 4-factor 3-level factorial experimental design tech-
nique was employed to investigate the variables like particle size 
and percent drug entrapment using the statistical software pack-
age (Version 7). This technique was applied to quantify the influ-
ence of operating parameters on the production of nanoparticles. 
The factorial design created various sets of the experiments in 
this study. The independant variables were drug concentration, 
polymer concentration, PVA concentration and sonication time. 
The software was also used to construct mathematical models 
for making response predictions for experiments. The goal of the 
experimental design was to find out, with the minimum number 
of experimental runs, the effect of various independent variables 
on the final product. The design is suitable for understanding the 
quadratic response surfaces. 
Qualitative estimates of the influence of the individual vari-
ables could be made by inspection of the data. However, it 
would be difficult visually to make predictions as to whether the </p>

<p>the aim of this study was to investigate the combined influence of 3 independent variables in the preparation of 
temozolomide bearing Non-peGylated and peGylated nanoparticles by emulsification solvent evaporation method. 
A 3 factor 2 level design was used to derive a polynomial quadratic model and construct contour plots to predict 
responses. the independent variables selected were concentration of drug (A), concentration of pLGA/peG-pLGA (B), 
pVA concentration in aqueous phase (C) and sonication time (D) and evaluated for percentage drug entrapment (pDe) 
and particle size (pS). A 3 
4 factorial design was used with 4 factors (A, B, C and D) at 3 levels and experimental trials 
were performed at all 82 possible combinations. In the present work, 28 runs are considered as the preliminary trials 
revealed that on increasing drug concentration from 2.5 to 5 mg the percent drug entrapment increases, but on further 
increasing the drug concentration (i.e., to 7.5 mg) no significant effect on the percent drug entrapment and particle size 
was observed. the 3 
4 factorial design was used to derive a polynomial quadratic model and construct contour plots to 
predict responses. Contour plots were constructed to show the effects of A, B, C and D on the pDe and pS. </p>

<p>interactions actually existed between the variables, or which sin-
gle variable had the most dominant effect. To achieve this, facto-
rial statistical design methods were applied and these designs are 
good alternatives to a full factorial design, especially in the initial 
screening stage. In this study a 4-factorial design was used where 
main factor effects are confounded with two factor and higher 
order interactions. The main effects and interaction effects calcu-
lated for the responses of particle size and entrapment efficiency. </p>

<p>1,2   In the present study emulsification solvent evaporation 
method was used for preparation and optimization of temozolo-
mide loaded Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles, as 
this method is widely used for the encapsulation of hydrophobic 
drugs. The study reveals the effect of independent variables [drug 
concentration (A), PLGA/PEG-PLGA concentration (B), PVA 
concentration (C) and Sonication time (D)] on percent drug 
entrapment and particles size. 
Traditional experiments require more effort, time and materi-
als when a complex formulation needs to be developed. Various 
experimental designs are useful in developing a formulation 
requiring less experimentation and providing estimates of the 
relative significance of different variables. </p>

<p>increasing drug concentration 2.5 to 5 mg the percent drug entrap-
ment increases, but on further increasing the drug concentration 
(i.e., 7.5 mg) no significant effect on the percent drug entrapment 
and particle size was observed. The 3

derive polynomial quadratic model and construct contour plots 
to predict responses of independent variables on percent drug

Data analysis. Percent drug entrapment. All the batches of for-
mulations of nanoparticles within the experimental design yielded 
nanoparticles which were evaluated for their size and percent drug 
entrapment. In this design, only fewer experiment (28 batches 
from one class of formulations) were studied where formulations 
are having 5 mg drug as optimum concentration of drug than full 
factorial design (82 batches). The transformed values of all the 
batches (28 each) for Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanopar-
ticles bearing separately TMZ along with the results are shown in 
Tables 1 and 2. The results show that formulations numbers 6, 
8, 9 and 18 from both class of formulations are exhibiting maxi-
mum percent drug entrapment i.e., &gt; 78% for Non-PEGylated 
nanoparticles of TMZ, while it is decreased about 3% in case </p>

<p>nanoparticles are smooth and spherical in shape. The synthesized 
conjugate, PEG-PLGA was used to prepare PEGylated nanopar-
ticles bearing drug. For comparing the efficacy of the PEGylated 
nanoparticles, Non-PEGylated nanoparticles were also prepared. 
The Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles bearing 
TMZ was prepared using emulsification solvent evaporation 
method technique reported by Avgoustakis, (2004). The various 
process and formulation variable, i.e., drug concentration, poly-
mer concentration, PVA concentration and sonication time were 
optimized to get small sized nanoparticles with maximum percent 
drug entrapment. These variables were optimized by applying 3 </p>

In this method of optimization, it is difficult to develop an 
optimized formulation as the method reveals nothing about 
the interaction among the variables. The independent variable 
selected were, concentration of drug (A), concentration of PLGA/ 
PEG-PLGA (B), PVA concentration in aqueous phase (C) and 
sonication time (D). Hence, a 3 
4 factorial design was used with 
4 factors (A, B, C and D) at 3 levels and experimental trials were 
performed at all 82 possible combinations which reveals that on </p>

<p>The main effect of A, B, C and D represents the average result 
of changing variable at a time from its low level to high level. 
The interaction terms (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, A 
2 , B 
2 , C </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>and D 
2 ) show how the PDE changes when 2 variables are simul-
taneously changed. The negative coefficient for all the indepen-
dent variables (D, AC, BD, A 
2 , C 
2 and D 
2 ) indicate unfavorable 
effect on the PDE while others are exhibiting positive interaction 
which indicate favorable effect on the PDE as its concentration 
in all selected formulation is kept unchanged. Among the four 
independent variables the lowest coefficient value is for D (−0.36 
and p &lt; 0.05) indicating that this variable is insignificant in the 
prediction of PDE. It is also observed that the PDE does not sig-
nificantly change (p &lt; 0.05) because as on changing sonication 
time from 30 sec to 90 sec there is very little decrease in the PDE 
which shows very less amount of drug loss due to size reduction 
of the nanoparticles. Similarly, the effect of PVA on the PDE of 
various nanoparticles was observed and as on increasing the PVA 
concentration from 0.5 to 1% in nanoparticles the PDE increases 
significantly while on further increasing PVA concentration </p>

<p>of PEGylation of nanoparticles. The PDE (dependent variable) 
obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and 
D). The response surface quadratic models were generated using 
<rs type="software">Expert Design Software</rs>. These were subjected to multiple regres-
sion to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). 
The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated 
which are found to be &gt; 0.94 indicating good fit. The PDE values 
measured for various batches showed wide variation i.e., ranges 
from a minimum of 52.89% to a maximum of 77.96% in case 
of temozolomide bearing Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while a 
minimum of 49.62% to a maximum of 75.91% in case temozolo-
mide bearing PEGylated nanoparticles. It is clearly indicated that 
the PDE is strongly affected by the variables selected for the study. 
It is observed that as on increasing the concentration of PLGA 
polymer in the matrix of nanoparticles the percent drug entrap-
ment was found to increased up to the level of medium (i.e., 50 
mg) at 5 mg of drug concentration then very little change in PDE 
was observed which could be due to completely entrapment of the 
drug into the polymer matrix. </p>

26-28 which indicates an adequate signal (Tables 5 and 6). 
Particle size. Nanoparticles are formed when specific concen-
tration of PLGA and PVA were mixed together. All the batches 
of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles within the 
experimental design were also evaluated for their particle size. 
The transformed values for particle size of all the batches (28 
each) of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles bearing 
temozolomide TMZ along with the results are shown in Tables 1 
and 2. The results show that formulations no. 10, 19, 20 and 22 
from each class of formulations are exhibiting minimum particle 
size, i.e., &lt; 114 nm for Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while it is 
increased about 6 nm more in case of PEGylation of nanoparticles 
which might be due to the diffusion of the copolymer solubilized 
in the organic phase leads to an homogenous distribution of the 
PEG chain on the surface of the droplets and on the surface of 
the NPs after solvent evaporation. The PS (dependent variable) 
obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and 
D). The response surface quadratic models were generated using 
Expert Design Software. These were subjected to multiple regres-
sion to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). 
The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated 
which are found to be &gt; 0.96 indicating good fit. The particle size 
of various nanoparticles formulations showed wide variation i.e., 
ranges from a minimum of 111.91 nm to a maximum of 120.88 </p>

<p>no significant change in PDE was observed in all the cases of 
nanoparticles formulations. This shows an appropriate concentra-
tion of PVA (surfactant 1%) for the better formation of emul-
sion. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) measures how much 
the variance of that model coefficient is inflated by the lack of 
orthogonality in the design and calculated for Non-PEGylated 
and PEGylated formulations for temozolomide which is found to 
be near 1 indicating good estimation of the coefficient (Tables 3 
and 4). Similarly Ri-squared is near to zero which is leading to 
good model. The model F value calculated in the range of 75.15 
to 81.00 which implies the models are significant. The values of 
Prob &gt; F less than 0.05 are indicating that model terms are sig-
nificant. In all cases A, B, C, D, AB, A 
2 and B 
2 are significant 
model terms. The lack of fit values "F-value" for Non-PEGylated 
nanoparticles was found to be 61.86, which implies the lack of 
fit is not significant relative to the pure error and there are only 
10-11% chances of large lack of fit "F-value" which could occur 
due to noise and non-significant lack of fit "F-value" is good fit of 
model. Similar results were obtained in PEGylated nanoparticles 
bearing temozolomide where lack of fit "F-value" was found to 
be 11.44% which is non-significant related to pure error. In both 
these cases 17-23% chances of large lack of fit "F-value" could 
occur due to noise. In both cases "Pred R-squared" values are in 
reasonable agreement with the "Adj R-squared" values. The Adeq-
Precision is the measures of the signal to noise ratio. A ratio &gt; 4 </p>

<p>The main effect of A, B, C and D represent the average result

show how the particle size changes when 2 variables are simulta-

2 , C 
2 and D

able effect on the particle size while others are exhibiting positive 
interaction which indicate favorable effect on the nanoparticles 
size. Among the 4 independent variable the lowest coefficient 
value is for D 
2 (−0.02 and p &lt; 0.05) indicating that this variable is 
insignificant in the prediction of PS as the concentration of drug 
was kept unchanged. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) mea-

which implies the models are significant. The values of Prob &gt; F 
less than 0.05 are indicating that model terms are significant. In 
all cases A, B, C, D, AB, A 
2 and C 
2 are significant model terms. 
The lack of fit values "F-value" for Non-PEGylated nanopar-
ticles was found to be 0.03 which implies the lack of fit is not sig-
nificant relative to the pure error and there is a 100% chances of 
large lack of fit "F-value" could occur due to noise and non-signif-
icant lack of fit "F-value" is good fit of model. Similar results were 
obtained in PEGylated nanoparticles where lack of fit "F-value" </p>

<p>nm in case of Non-PEGylated nanoparticles and 116.31 nm to 
123.76 nm in case of PEGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolo-
mide. It is clearly indicated that the particle size of the nanopar-
ticles is strongly affected by the variables selected for the study. It 
is observed that as on increasing the concentration of PLGA poly-
mer in the matrix of nanoparticles the particle size was found to 
increase upto the level of medium (i.e., 50 mg) at 5 mg of drug con-
centration then little change in particle size was observed which 
could be due to saturation of the polymer matrix. 
It is also observed that the PS was significantly changed (p &gt; 
0.05) because as on changing sonication time from 30 sec to 90 sec 
there is decrease in the PS of the nanoparticles which could be due 
to the production of high energy and released with rapid dispersion 
to form small size nanoparticles. Similarly, the effect of PVA on the 
PS of various nanoparticles was observed and as on increasing the 
PVA concentration from 0.5 to 1% concentration in nanoparticles, 
the PS increases insignificantly while on further increasing PVA 
concentration to 1.5% significant change in PS was observed in all 
the cases of nanoparticles formulations. This shows the appropriate 
concentration of PVA (surfactant 1%) for the better formation of 
tight surface of PVA macromolecules at high concentration which 
increased diffusion resistance of drugs from aqueous phase and sta-
bilized the emulsion. But too much of PVA was susceptible in the 
nanoparticles because it could not be totally biodegraded in vivo 
and could decrease cellular uptake of nanoparticles. On the other 
hand too much of PVA was difficult to remove. </p>

"F-value" could occur due to noise. 
In all cases "Pred R-squared" values are in reasonable agree-
ment with the "Adj R-squared" values. The Adeq-Precision is the 
measures of the signal to noise ratio. A ratio of greater than 4 
is desirable. In our case the Adeq-Precision value is in range of 
48-72 which indicates an adequate signal (Tables 7 and 8). </p>

<p>PDE (76.02%) and a small PS (112.93 nm) for Non-PEGylated 
and high value of PDE (75.12%) and a small PS (117.23 nm) for 
PEGylated nanoparticles. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods </p>

<p>Temozolomide was obtained as a gift sample from the Kandelwal 
Lab, Mumbai, India. Poly (D-L-lactic-Co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) 
with L:G molar ratio of 50:50 and Mw of 20,000, Bis-amine-
PEG, Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Stannous octoate, were procured 
from Sigma Chemicals. Cellophane membrane (molecular weight 
cut off, 12000-14000 dalton) was procured from Himedia Ltd., 
Mumbai, India. All other reagents used in this study were of 
HPLC grade. Water wherever used was unionized and sterile 
water for injection. 
The traditional approach to developing a formulation is to 
change 1 variable at time. By this method it is difficult to develop 
an optimized formulation, as the method 
reveals nothing about the interactions 
among the variables. Hence, a 3 
4 factorial 
design was used with 4 factors (A, B, C and 
D) at 3 levels and experimental trials were 
performed at all 82 possible combinations. 
The dependent and independent variables 
are listed in Table 9.

<p>Particle size. The size of the nanoparticles was determined with 
the help of laser diffraction particle size analyzer (Cilas 1604L). 
Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles were suspended in 
the chamber of particle size analyzer containing milli-Q water 
and the vesicles size were determined using the software provided 
with the instrument. 
Percentage drug entrapment (PDE). The amount of drug 
encapsulated in nanoparticles was determined using the method 
reported by Khuller and Pandey. 
5 The lyophilized non-PEGylated 
and PEGylated nanoparticles were digested in 5 ml of 0.1 M 
NaOH at 50°C for 10 min to release the drug content and resul-
tant mixture was filtered. The volume was adjusted to 10 ml with 
0.1 M NaOH. The amount of drug was quantified by HPLC 
method. 
Drug encapsulation efficiency (%) = Amount of drug released 
from the lysed NPs/amount of drug initially taken to prepare the 
NPs × 100. 
Checkpoint analysis. A checkpoint analysis was performed to 
confirm the role of the derived polynomial equation and contour 
plots in predicting the responses. Values of independent variables 
were taken at 3 points. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>Optimization of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles is 
a complex process that require one to consider a large number 
of variables and their interactions with each other. The present 
study demonstrates the use of quadratic model in optimization 
of nanoparticles formulations. The derived equation and contour 
plots aid in predicting the values of selected independent variables 
for preparation of optimum nanoparticles with desired properties. </p>

<p>octoate as catalyst. 
3 Stannous octoate has been approved by the 
US FDA for surgical and pharmacological application. This 
compound is the most widely used initiator as it provides high 
reaction ratio, and high molar mass even under relatively mild 
conditions. </p>

<p>4 </p>

<p>Briefly, lactide and glycolide in a molar ratio of 4:1 and the 
specified amount of Bis-PEG were put in thick-walled glass 
tubes. The total weight of the feed was about 3 g. Stannous 
octoate was dissolved in hexane and added at a concentration of 
0.03% by the weight of the feed. Then, the tubes were heated 
at 190°C for the 2 h. The resulting copolymer was purified by 
dissolving in chloroform and then precipitating in an excess 
methanol. The purified copolymer was dried under vaccum. </p>

<p>5 </p>

<p>Preparation of non-PEGylated nanoparticles. Drug loaded 
Non-PEGylated nanoparticles were prepared using emulsifica-
tion solvent evaporation method (Avgoustakis, 2004) which is 
widely used for the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs. Briefly, 
temozolomide (5 mg) and PLGA (50 mg) were dissolved in 
acetone (5 ml) (organic phase). The organic phase was added 
at a constant flow rate (0.3 ml/min) into 20 ml of aqueous 
phase containing 1% of PVA under intense shear using probe 
sonicator (Lark Innovative Fine Tecknowledge). The resultant 
mixture was further stirred for 2 h using magnetic stirrer. The 
organic solvent was then evaporated off under vacuum using 
a rotavapor (Steroglass). Then NPs were lyophilized (Heto 
Drywiner) at −46°C, 0.001 atm for 24 h with 5% w/w mannitol 
which was used as cryoprotectant (Yin et al., 2006). </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>Preparation of PEGylated nanoparticles. PEGylated 
nanoparticles were also prepared by emulsification solvent 
evaporation method. All the parameters were kept same except 
the PLGA polymer was replaced with PEG PLGA Copolymer. 
These Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles were 
stored in a tightly closed container until further evaluation. 
Characterization of non-PEGylated and PEGylated 
nanoparticles. Shape morphology. The Non-PEGylated and 
PEGylated nanoparticles were characterized for the shape by 
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Philips XL 30 scanning 
microscope, Philips). The nanoparticles were coated with gold-
palladium alloy (150-250 Å) using a sputter coater. The coater 
was operated at 2.2 kV, 20 mV, 0.1 torr (argon) for 90 sec at an 
accelerating voltage of 15 kv. The samples were viewed under a 
scanning electron microscope. </p>
