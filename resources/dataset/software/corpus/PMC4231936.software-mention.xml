<p>rates. Based on previous research, 
we hypothesized that older, female 
participants who have better gly-
cemic control would respond to a 
higher percentage of SMART Project 
text messages. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Study participants 
SMART Project study participants 
included 23 adolescents, aged 13-17 
years, who had been diagnosed 
with type 1 diabetes for at least 
1 year and who were followed by 
the endocrinology department at 
a Mid-Atlantic children's hospital 
(Table 1). Participants were excluded 
if they were not on a basal-bolus 
insulin regimen (via multiple daily 
injections or insulin pump), did not 
have a cell phone with an unlimited 
text message plan, were diagnosed 
with severe psychopathology and/or 
developmental/physical disabilities, 
were not fluent in English, or did not 
have parental consent. </p>

<p>Study procedure 
Identification of eligible partici-
pants was conducted by reviewing 
clinic lists. Patients who met initial 
SMART Project eligibility criteria 
were mailed recruitment letters and 
a postcard that could be returned if 
they did not wish to be contacted. 
Patients were contacted by phone 1 
week later to assess their eligibility 
and complete verbal consent. 
Patients who provided consent 
attended an orientation to the </p>

<p>SMART Project during a regu-
larly scheduled clinic appointment. 
Informed assent and parental 
consent were obtained, partici-
pants were oriented to the SMART 
Project, and adolescents completed 
a demographics and medical his-
tory questionnaire. Participants 
were registered in the <rs type="software">SMART 
Project program</rs>, a two-way text 
message software program con-
tracted through Reify Health of 
Baltimore, Md., and the timing of 
texts was customized according to 
their schedules. Participants were 
instructed to choose morning (before 
school), afternoon (after school), 
evening (before bed), and weekend 
mid-morning times. Glucose meters 
were downloaded, and medical 
charts were reviewed for A1C results. 
Participants were compensated with 
a $25 gift card. 
Subsequently, participants 
received text messages for 6 weeks. 
During Week 1, participants were 
prompted to text their blood glucose 
levels three times per day (morning, 
afternoon, and evening). During 
Weeks 2-5, they received text mes-
sages 2 times per day (morning and 
either afternoon or evening) regard-
ing topics related to type 1 diabetes, 
including blood glucose monitoring 
(Week 2), nutrition (Week 3), physi-
cal activity (Week 4), and sleep/mood 
(Week 5). Texts included two parts: 
type 1 diabetes-related information 
and tips and a request to respond to 
a specific question. During Week 6, </p>

<p>participants again were prompted to 
text their blood glucose levels three 
times per day. Participants received 
a confirmation text for all texts they 
sent. Immediately after completion 
of the 6-week program, participants 
completed follow-up questionnaires. </p>

<p>Study measures 
Sociodemographic and medi-
cal questionnaires. Participants 
reported their age, sex, race/ 
ethnicity, family income, par-
ents' marital status, and insulin 
regimen using the Demographics-
General Information and Medical 
Information questionnaires. 
Glycemic control. A1C was 
calculated for each participant at the 
clinic appointment that was closest 
in time to their orientation to the 
SMART Project and recorded by 
a research team member. Thus, all 
A1C values reflected adolescents' 
glycemic control during the months 
immediately before participation 
started. All assays were conducted 
with a DCA 2000+ analyzer 
(Siemens/Bayer, Munich, Germany), 
a point-of-care type 1 diabetes man-
agement platform that performs an 
A1C test in minutes. </p>

<p>9 </p>

<p>Blood glucose data. Participants' 
glucose meters were downloaded at the 
clinical appointment during which they 
were oriented to the SMART Project 
to obtain blood glucose data from the 
30 days before their enrollment. These 
data were used to calculate their num-
ber of daily blood glucose checks and 
average daily blood glucose level. </p>

<p>Cell phone use. A four-item ques-
tionnaire was developed by our team 
to assess adolescents' cell phone use. 
Participants reported how many days 
per week they used their cell phone 
to text, how many texts they sent per 
day, how many days per week they 
talked on their cell phone, and how 
many hours they talk on the phone 
per day. 
Text message data. Participants' 
responses to SMART Project text 
messages were collected via the <rs type="software">Reify 
Health</rs> software program, and the 
time and verbatim text of text mes-
sages were downloaded. From these 
data, response rates and response 
latency were calculated. Overall 
and weekly response rates were 
calculated as the percentage of texts 
to which an adolescent responded. 
For Weeks 1 and 6, adolescents 
were supposed to text their blood 
glucose levels three times per day 
(morning, afternoon, and evening); 
thus, the denominator in the Week 
1 and Week 6 equations was 21 (3 
times per day × 7 days). For Weeks 
2-5, adolescents were supposed to </p>

<p>respond to two texts per day (morn-
ing and either afternoon or evening); 
thus, the denominator in the equa-
tions for Weeks 2-5 was 14 (2 
times per day × 7 days). Finally, the 
denominator for the overall Week 
1-Week 6 response rate was 98 (the 
sum of texts they were asked to send 
each week). Response latency was 
calculated as the number of minutes 
before the adolescent responded. </p>

<p>Data analysis 
All statistical analyses were 
conducted using <rs id="software-2" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">20th ed.</rs>. 
(<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">International Business Machines</rs>, 
Armonk, N.Y.). Descriptive statistics 
were generated to assess adoles-
cents' demographic and medical 
characteristics and their SMART 
Project text message response rate 
and latency by week and time of 
day. Correlational analyses were 
conducted to determine whether ado-
lescents' demographic and medical 
characteristics were related to their 
text message response rates. </p>

<p>Study Results </p>

<p>Aim 1: Adolescent recruitment/ 
retention and SMART Project 
response patterns 
Recruitment letters were mailed to 
97 patients initially identified as 
eligible through screening. Fifty-five 
percent were reached by phone by 
a research assistant to discuss the 
project and assess their eligibility. 
Seventeen patients declined to par-
ticipate, 10 were ineligible, and three 
verbally consented but did not com-
plete an orientation session. Thus, 23 
adolescents (54% of eligible partici-
pants) consented and were enrolled 
in the SMART Project. Retention 
was high; 96% of participants 
responded to texts throughout the 
6 weeks of the SMART Project and 
completed follow-up data collection. 
Participants responded to 78% 
of texts with some variability based 
on week (Table 2). Participants 
responded to the most texts during 
Week 3 (83%; nutrition texts) and to 
the least texts during Week 6 (53%; 
assessment phase 2; blood glucose 
prompt texts). Text message response 
rates and latencies were examined 
for a small, randomly selected subset 
of participants according to time of 
day (n = 8) (Table 3). Regardless of 
time, adolescents responded to the 
majority of texts (≥ 76%). Mean 
response latency was 64 minutes 
(standard deviation 148, range 
6-227). Response latency was not 
related to response rate, regardless of 
time of day (P &gt; 0.05). For example, 
adolescents responded to 86% of 
morning texts, despite the fact that 
it took them longer to respond to 
morning texts (106 minutes) than to 
afternoon, evening, or weekend mid-
morning texts. </p>

<p>Feature Article / Diabetes Texting Program for Adolescents </p>

<p>Aim 2: Medical/demographic 
characteristics related to text 
message response rate 
To assess how demographic variables 
(age, sex, ethnicity, family income, 
and parent marital status) and medi-
cal variables (average monthly blood 
glucose level, number of daily blood 
glucose checks, A1C, and insulin 
regimen) were related to overall 
text response rates, a series of cor-
relational analyses were conducted. 
There was a significant correlation 
between adolescents' sex and overall 
text response rate (r = 0.41, P &lt; 0.05); 
females responded to more SMART 
Project texts than males. Similarly, 
there was a significant positive cor-
relation between the self-reported 
number of personal texts adolescents 
sent per day and the text response 
rate (r = 0.82, P &lt; 0.001); adolescents 
who sent more personal texts per 
day responded to a greater number 
of SMART Project texts. There was 
also a trend for adolescents who 
had a lower mean monthly blood 
glucose level to respond to more 
texts (r = -0.39, P = 0.08). No other 
demographic or medical variables 
were related to text response rate. </p>

<p>Discussion 
More than half of eligible par-
ticipants were interested in and 
completed all 6 weeks of the SMART 
Project. Adolescents responded to the 
majority of texts within 1-2 hours, 
although there was some variability 
in response rate according to the 
week and in response latency accord-
ing to the time of day. Adolescents 
responded to type 1 diabetes infor-
mation and tips more than blood 
glucose check prompts. Specifically, 
adolescents responded to more texts 
about nutrition and physical activ-
ity than to other topics; these may 
be areas of particular interest for 
adolescents with type 1 diabetes. 
Adolescents also tended to respond 
to SMART Project texts regardless 
of the time of day, although it took 
them longer to respond to morning 
texts than to afternoon and evening 
texts. Mornings are likely to be 
particularly busy for adolescents as 
they prepare for school, so tasks such 
as checking type 1 diabetes-related 
texts are less of a priority. </p>

<p>Three groups of adolescents were 
most likely to respond to SMART 
Project texts: girls, adolescents who 
self-reported that they send a large 
number of daily personal texts, and 
adolescents with lower monthly 
mean blood glucose levels. That girls 
responded to more texts is consistent 
with other research documenting 
that girls text more than boys. </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>It also makes intuitive sense that 
adolescents who text more and have 
lower blood glucose levels (i.e., who 
may be more adherent to their regi-
men) are more inclined to respond to 
type 1 diabetes-related texts. Future 
type 1 diabetes text message projects 
with adolescents may expect compa-
rable results. However, it was equally 
notable that response rates were 
not related to age, ethnicity, family 
income, or insulin regimen; adoles-
cents from diverse backgrounds can 
benefit from programs similar to the 
SMART Project. 
There are several notable 
strengths of this study, including our 
ability to calibrate the timing of text 
messages to fit adolescents' schedules 
and to monitor text responses. We 
ensured that adolescents received 
texts at an optimal time and calcu-
lated response rates and latencies, 
which have not been options in 
previous text message programs for 
youths with type 1 diabetes. We also 
did not include access to a cell phone 
as an incentive. Thus, we can confi-
dently say that adolescents responded 
to SMART Project texts because 
they wanted to respond, not because 
they had to respond to use a cell 
phone. We also experienced minimal 
technical difficulties as a result of 
several weeks of beta testing before 
participant enrollment. 
There are, however, study limita-
tions that should be addressed in 
future research. The SMART Project 
had a small sample size, was con-
ducted over a period of only 6 weeks, 
and provided type 1 diabetes content 
that varied by week rather than 
within each week. Some adoles-
cents reported that they wanted to 
receive texts with a variety of type 
1 diabetes topics throughout each 
week, instead of focusing on only 
one topic per week. Greater variety 
may have increased the novelty of the </p>

<p>SMART Project and concomitant 
response rates. 
These results contribute to a 
growing body of literature regarding 
the use of text message interventions 
for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. 
A recent review of the literature iden-
tified seven published studies that 
included text messages as a means of 
improving adolescents' knowledge 
about type 1 diabetes and adherence 
to their treatment regimen. 
8 Some 
of these interventions focused only 
on blood glucose monitoring </p>

<p>10,11 </p>

<p>and sent all participants the same 
information, 
12,13 but there is a trend 
for the development of increasingly 
personalized text message programs 
that include two-way communi-
cation between participants and 
medical providers. For example, both 
Franklin et al. 
14 and Mulvaney et al. </p>

<p>15 </p>

<p>reported on text message programs 
that included the development of 
personal type 1 diabetes profiles and 
goals for each participant during 
clinic appointments, which were 
then used to select appropriate texts. 
Hanauer et al. 
10 included the medi-
cal team in their program, such that 
adolescents received health care rec-
ommendations by text if the blood 
glucose level they submitted was out 
of range. Although these programs 
are more time-intensive to develop 
and coordinate and require the par-
ticipation of additional medical team 
members, preliminary A1C results 
and participant satisfaction indicate 
that these efforts may have a positive 
impact on outcomes. 
Future studies should be devel-
oped with the goal of increasing 
engagement among boys and 
adolescents who have higher aver-
age blood glucose levels. Hingle et 
al. 
7 reported that adolescents enjoy 
responding to text quizzes; thus, 
including a game component may 
be a method to encourage partici-
pation. This may take the form of 
a competitive, social component 
(either text-based or smartphone 
application-based) composed of text 
quizzes and weekly game "leaders" 
(i.e., the usernames of adolescents 
who respond the most or answer 
the most questions correctly). The 
study by Hingle et al. also revealed 
that adolescents prefer health text </p>



<p>Diabetes Spectrum Volume 27, Number 4, 2014 </p>

<p>Feature Article / Herbert et al. </p>

<p>message programs that include some 
nonhealth information. 
7 Adolescents 
who have worse glycemic control 
and are less inclined to participate in 
a type 1 diabetes-related program 
may be encouraged to participate if 
the program includes nonhealth texts 
or fun facts (i.e., trivia). 
Additional suggestions for future 
programs are the development and 
evaluation of the inclusion of a par-
ent component and the possibility 
of integrating the SMART Project 
into clinical care. Although parents 
did not receive text messages in the 
current study, parents of partici-
pants provided feedback that they 
wanted to receive educational type 1 
diabetes texts as well. Others men-
tioned that they would appreciate 
type 1 diabetes clinic appointment 
and/or prescription reminders via 
text message. Additionally, the 
SMART Project did not provide 
adolescents with feedback regard-
ing their responses. Engagement 
and response rates may increase if 
a health care provider is available 
to review responses and provide 
real-time feedback (e.g., respond 
to high or low blood glucose levels 
with reminders about hyper-and 
hypoglycemia management). Finally, 
it will be important to determine 
whether SMART Project texts 
changed patients' type 1 diabetes-
related behavior. 
Collectively, these results docu-
ment the feasibility of a text message 
program for youths with type 1 
diabetes. Adolescents who were 
interested in receiving type 1 diabe-
tes-related text messages actively 
engaged with the program for an 
extended period of time. Although 
girls were more likely to respond 
to texts, most adolescents, regard-
less of other demographic and 
medical characteristics, responded </p>

<p>to SMART Project texts. Mobile 
health technologies such as text mes-
sages may be a particularly relevant 
method of intervention for youths 
with type 1 diabetes. </p>
