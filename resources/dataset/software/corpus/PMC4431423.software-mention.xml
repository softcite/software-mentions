<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Background: The Rosemary extract (RE) possesses various antioxidant, cytoprotective and cogni-
tion-improving bioactivities. In this study, we postulated which doses of RE have a more effect on 
the hippocampus of middle-aged rats. 
Methods: In this experimental study, thirty-two middle-aged male Wistar rats were fed by different 
doses (50,100 and 200 mg/kg/day) of RE (containing 40% carnosic acid) or distilled water for 12 
weeks. The effects of different RE doses on learning and spatial memory scores, hippocampal neu-
ronal survival, antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation amount were evaluated by one and two 
way analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
Results: It seemed that RE (100mg/kg) could recover the spatial memory retrieval score (p&lt; 0.05). 
The amount of activity of SOD, GPx and CAT enzymes in the hippocampus of animals of the RE 
(100mg/kg) group showed a significant increase compared to the normal group (p&lt; 0.01), (p&lt; 0.01) 
and (p&lt; 0.05), respectively. Also, the amount of activity of GPx in the RE (50 mg/kg) group of ani-
mals showed a significant increase compared to the normal group (p&lt; 0.05). No significant differ-
ence was found between the groups in the MDA level. 
Conclusion: The results revealed that rosemary extract (40% carnosic acid) may improve the 
memory score and oxidative stress activity in middle aged rats in a dose dependent manner, especial-
ly in 100mg/kg. </p>

<p>Introduction 
In recent decades, traditional medicine 
has become more popular. A main reason 
of this popularity is that herbs are rich in 
natural antioxidants (1). Natural antioxi-
dants are not usually toxic compared to </p>

<p>synthetic antioxidants. Antioxidants have 
an important role in the prevention of many 
diseases and aging. These materials are ca-
pable of blocking initiation or propagation 
of oxidizing chain reactions (2). 
The Lamiaceae family seems to be a rich 
source of large amounts of phenolic acids, </p>

<p>so it is revealed to be a potential source of 
natural antioxidant (3). Rosemary (Rosma-
rinus officinalis L. family Lamiaceae) is a 
spice and medicinal herb which is widely 
used around the world (4). 
Several studies have found some benefi-
cial effects for rosemary leaves such as an-
ti-inflammatory, anti-viral, cytoprotective 
and anti-tumoral effects (5). Rosemary con-
tains numerous compounds including diter-
penes, triterpenes, flavones and steroids. 
The main compounds, which cause RE ef-
ficacy, are two phenolic diterpenes: carno-
sic acid (CA) and carnosol (about 90% of 
antioxidant activity) (6). 
CA is a lipophilic antioxidant that re-
moves the most free radicals. Free radicals 
atoms and molecules that have an unpaired 
electron, including superoxide radical ani-
on, hydroxyl radicals and lipid peroxyl rad-
icals may produce oxidative damage direct-
ly to critical biological molecules. Free rad-
icals are generally the by-products of vari-
ous endogenous processes that can have a 
noxious effect on cell macromolecules, 
such as proteins, lipoproteins, carbohy-
drates, DNA and RNA (7). 
Researches showed that CA protects cor-
tical neurons by activating the Keap1/Nrf2 
pathway (8). On the other hand, Satoh et al. 
suggested that the neuroprotective effects 
of CA critically require both free carbox-
ylic acid and catechol hydroxyl moieties. 
Thus, neuroprotective effects of CA may be 
due to its hydrophilicity (9). 
Oxidative damage is particularly detri-
mental to the brain, because brain weighs 
about 2% of the body mass, but it utilizes 
20% of the total oxygen consumption. 
Meanwhile, except for some limited areas 
of the brain, the neuronal cells are largely 
post-mitotic and tend to accumulate oxida-
tive damage. The brain is enriched by poly-
unsaturated fatty acids, which are perox-
idizable. In addition, the brain contains 
large amounts of ascorbate and iron, which 
are important catalysts for lipid peroxida-
tion. Also, It has moderate amounts of en-
dogenous antioxidant enzymes, superoxide 
dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and a </p>

<p>very low level of catalase activity (10). 
Hippocampus is a part of the brain which 
plays an important role in cognition, mood 
regulation, response to stress, learning and 
memory (11). The Hippocampus is one of 
the most vulnerable brain regions to oxida-
tive stress (12). 
Numerous enzymatic and non-enzymatic 
antioxidant defense systems exist in cells to 
protect them from the damaging effects of 
free radical reactions (13). Since the en-
dogenous antioxidant protection systems 
are not 100% effective, we assume that nu-
tritional antioxidants could have beneficial 
effects on the memory, neurogenesis and 
activities of enzymatic oxidative in the 
brain. 
The main goal of this study was to de-
termine which RE dose has the best poten-
cy to improve the memory and antioxidant 
status of the hippocampus in middle-aged 
rats. We focused on the effect of different 
RE doses ( 50mg, 100mg and 200mg) on 
learning and spatial memory in rats by 
Morris Water Maze test, pyramidal cells 
survival of CA1 area in hippocampus, ac-
tivities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase 
(CAT) and lipid peroxidation (MDA). </p>

<p>Methods 
Data 
Male Wistar rats (n= 32) weighing 250-
330g (middle-aged: 9 months) were ob-
tained from the Animal Care Center of Iran 
University of Medical Sciences. These rats 
were housed (3/cage) under controlled en-
vironmental conditions 12:12-h light-dark. 
The room temperature was maintained at 
21-23 ºC; and they were fed by standard 
pellet rat chow and had free access to tap 
water. All experiments were conducted ac-
cording to the policy of Ethics Committee 
of the Iran University of Medical Sciences. 
The rats were randomly divided into four 
groups (n= 8 per group): one normal and 
three RE groups of rats. For the RE groups, 
rosemary extract was dissolved in distilled 
water in different doses (50,100 and, 200 
mg/kg) and was administered (1mL) orally </p>

<p>as a single daily dose for twelve weeks. 
The normal group received 1 mL of dis-
tilled water every day using the same pro-
tocol. </p>

<p>Materials 
The rosemary extract (RE) containing 
40% carnosic acid was purchased from Hu-
nan Geneham Biomedical Technological 
Company of China, (RAP20-110401). Cre-
syl violet acetate was purchased from Sig-
ma Chemical Co. Saint Louis, Missouri 
USA. SOD, GPx, and, CATA kits were ob-
tained from Randox, UK. </p>

<p>Behavioral Assessment 
Morris water maze (MWM) test was per-
formed for all the rats after 12-weeks and 
after they completed the treatment period. 
This test is used to evaluate learning and 
spatial memory in rodents (14,15). Behav-
ioral tests were done two hours after RE 
gavage. 
Morris Water Maze Test: This test was 
carried out in a quiet room containing mul-
tiple external cues (e.g., a white door and a 
colorful poster on the wall). The water 
maze was made up from a stainless steel 
black circular tank with a diameter of 210 
cm and 50 cm in height. The tank was filled 
with 25 cm deep water (20±1ºC). The maze 
was divided geographically into four quad-
rants: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and 
Southwest. A hidden circular black plat-
form with a diameter of 10cm was located 
in the N.W quadrant center, 20 cm away 
from the sidewall and submerged 1 cm be-
low the water surface. A video camera was 
mounted directly above the water maze to 
record the rats' swim path. 
Acquisition Testing (Learning Phase): 
This process was previously described by 
Jacobson (16). The starting position was 
randomly changed and the rats received 
four trials each day for five consecutive 
days. During each trial, each rat was placed 
in the water with its head pointed toward 
the sidewall and was given 60s to find the 
hidden platform. If the rat found the plat-
form, it was allowed to remain on it for </p>

<p>20s. If the rat was unable to locate the plat-
form within 60 s, it was guided to the plat-
form. During the acquisition phase, the 
platform position remained unchanged. 
The traveled distance, escape latency and 
swimming speed of each rat were calculat-
ed (Figs. 1, 2). 
Spatial Probe Test (Memory Retrieval): 
On the 6 th day of the experiment, the plat-
form was removed and during 60 seconds, 
the time spent in this zone was recorded 
and analyzed for retention of spatial refer-
ence memory (Fig. 3). </p>

<p>Histological Study 
After the behavioral tests, the animals (n= 
3 in each group) were perfused transcardi-
ally, with 4% paraformaldehyde. Then the 
brains were placed in the post-fix solution 
overnight. The samples were processed and 
embedded in the paraffin. Coronal sections 
(4µ thickness) were prepared by a micro-
tome rotary (LEICA RM 2235) and were 
stained with Nissl staining (cresyl violet 
acetate: 0/01%) (17). The pyramidal neu-
rons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus 
were counted in 3 sections (which found 
between -2.8 to -3.1mm from bregma) for 
each animal (Fig. 4). </p>

<p>Antioxidant Enzymes Detect 
After the behavior tests, the animals (n= 4 
in each group) were anesthetized with ket-
amine (150mg/kg) and xylazine (15mg/kg), 
then were decapitated (by animal guillo-
tine). The brains were immediately re-
moved, and the hippocampus was isolated; 
all samples were washed in an ice-cold 
phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The washed 
samples were immediately immersed in 
liquid nitrogen and stored at −80º C until 
biochemical analysis. On the day of use, 
the frozen tissue samples were quickly 
weighed and homogenized 1:10 (W/V) in 
ice-cold tris-Hcl centrifuged at 12000 × g 
for 20 min at 4º C. The supernatants were 
separated and used for enzyme activity as-
say and lipid peroxidation level. </p>

<p>Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) Activity 
SOD activity was determined by method 
of Misra and Fridovich (18). In this pro-
cess, an aliquot of 0.25 ml ice cold chloro-
form was added to 0.1 ml of supernatant 
followed by adding 0.15 ml ice cold etha-
nol. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 
rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Then 0.2 ml of 
supernatant was taken and 1.5 ml carbonate 
buffer, 0.5CC EDTA, and 0.8 ml distilled 
water was added. Reaction was started by 
adding 0.4 ml epinephrine. Change in ab-
sorbance ΔOD/min at 480 nm was read for 
3 minutes. The results were expressed in 
terms of nmol/min/mg protein. </p>

<p>Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) Activity 
GPx activity was determined spectropho-
tometrically based on Wheeler method (19) 
and using Randox kit recommendations. 
The reaction was initiated by adding 
0.2mM H2O2, 1.0mM GSH, 0.14U of glu-
tathione reductase GR, 1.5mM NADPH, 
1.0mM sodium azide, 0.1M phosphate 
buffer (pH= 7.4), and 1 mg/ml of superna-
tant hippocampus at room temperature. En-
zyme activity was calculated as the nmol of 
oxidized nicotinamide adenin dinucleotide 
phosphate. Absorbance changes were rec-
orded at 340 nm. </p>

<p>Catalase (CAT) Activity 
CAT activity was measured based on en-
zyme ability to break down H2O2. The 
method was performed according to modi-
fied method of Aebi (20). For this purpose, 
the tissues were homogenized in isotonic 
buffer (pH= 7.4) and were centrifuged at 
1,000 g for 10 minutes. A volume of 20µl 
100-fold diluted supernatant was added to 
980 µl assay mixture, containing 10mmol/l 
of H2O2 (900µl), Tris-HCl buffer (50µl, 
pH= 8), and distilled water (30µl). The rate 
of H2O2 decomposition was monitored 
spectrophotometrically at 240nm. </p>

<p>Lipid Peroxidation (LP) Level 
One of the products of LP is malondial-
dehyde (MDA). Lipid peroxidation level 
was determined by Satoh method (21). This </p>

<p>method was used to measure, spectropho-
tometrically, the color produced by TBA 
and MDA reaction. The supernatant of hip-
pocampus was precipitated by trichloroace-
tic acid (TCA), and the mixture was heated 
with thioburbituric acid in 2M sodium sul-
phate in a boiling water bath for 30 
minutes. The resulting chromogenic color 
which was extracted by n-butyl alcohol and 
the sample absorbance was measured at 
530 nm. MDA levels were expressed as 
nm/mg protein. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis 
Data were evaluated by one way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) followed by the 
Tukey's post hoc test. Repeated ANOVA 
were run for MWM traveled distance and 
escape latency data. Analyses were per-
formed using <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>. Significance level was 
set at p&lt; 0.05. Values were expressed as 
mean ± SEM. </p>

<p>Results 
Behavioral Test (MWM) 
The predescribed test had two stages, ac-
quisition test (learning) and probe test (re-
tention of spatial memory). In the first 
stage, we measured traveled distance, 
escape latency and swimming speed. In the 
latter stage, time spent in the target 
quadrant was calculated. </p>

<p>Traveled Distance 
Traveled distance to find the platform is 
one of the parameters evaluated in MWM, 
which describes the learning process. The 
results, analyzed by repeated measures 
ANOVA, were F(3,141)= 4.017, (p=0.008); 
F(4,970)= 27.49, (p= 0.001); and F(12,45)= 
1.3, (p= 0.221) for groups, days and 
groups-days, respectively. 
No significant difference was observed 
between the normal and treatment groups 
during the five-day learning period with 
respect to the traveled distance scores (one 
way ANOVA) (Fig. 1). </p>

<p>Escape Latency 
Escape latency is the time required by a </p>

analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA, 
were F(3,94)= 6.83, (p= 0.001); F(4,37)= 
26.85, (p= 0.001); F(12,71)= 0.517 (p= 
902) for groups, days and groups-days, re-
spectively. 
No considerable difference was found be-
tween the normal and treatment groups dur-
ing the five-day learning process with re-
spect to escape latency (one way ANOVA) 
(Fig. 2). </p>

<p>Swimming Speed

and 13.04±0.46, respectively. No signifi-
cant difference was observed between all 
groups with respect to the swimming speed. </p>

<p>Time Spent in the Target Quadrant 
On the 6 th day of the MWM test (probe 
test), or on the retention day, the time spent 
in the target quadrant was tested. The time 
spent (mean±SEM) in the normal, RE 
(50mg/kg), RE (100mg/kg) and RE 
(200mg/kg) groups were 16.98±1.09, 
20.34±1.68, 22.97±1.4 and 18.87±1.8, re-
spectively.

<p>Discussion 
The aim of this study was to examine the 
effect of administration of different doses 
(50, 100 and 200mg/kg) of RE on spatial 
memory and learning scores, density of 
neurons in the CA1 area of hippocampus, 
the oxidative stress status and level of lipid 
peroxidation in hippocampus in middle-
aged rat. 
The diet supplement with natural antioxi-
dant properties was shown to have 
beneficial effects (De la Fuente and Victor, 
2000). Antioxidants can inhibit the oxida-
tion of other molecules. Oxidation is a 
chemical reaction that transfers electrons or 
hydrogen from a substance by an oxidizing 
agent. Oxidation reactions can produce free 
radicals. Antioxidants are various substanc-
es that show remarkable radical scavenging 
effects even at low concentrations (22). 
One natural compound that possesses 
high levels of antioxidants is found in the </p>

<p>Rosemary plant. This plant has been widely 
used as a preservative in the food industry 
(23). 
The most important components in RE 
are phenolic diterpenes such as carnosic 
acid (CA), carnosol and other phenolic ac-
ids (24). CA is a lipophilic antioxidant with 
the ability to prevent lipid peroxidation, 
and it avoids the disruption of the biologi-
cal membrane by scavenging free radicals 
(25). 
It is believed that hippocampus play an 
essential role in spatial memory formation 
and is highly vulnerable to oxidative dam-
age. The maintenance of a normal redox 
state in the hippocampus is important for 
the prevention of cognitive functions de-
cline in aging (26). 
Rasoolijazi et al. suggested that CA 
(10mg/kg) may improve the memory and 
learning scores which were decreased by 
the toxicity of β-amyloid in the rat hippo-</p>

<p>campus (27). 
Memory is often considered to be a pro-
cess that has several stages including acqui-
sition, consolidation and retrieval (28). Per-
formance of MWM test is a key technique 
to investigate the hippocampal circuitry, 
and also it has been linked to long-term po-
tentiation (LTP) and N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptor function (15). 
This study found that animals in all 
groups traveled longer distances and spent 
lesser time to find the platform during the 
five-day learning phase. However, no sig-
nificant difference was found in this score 
between the groups. On the other hand, in 
the probe test stage, animals in the RE 
group (100mg/kg) spent more time in the 
target quadrant compared to the normal 
group (p&lt; 0.05). 
Recent studies have suggested that 
changes in diet can have positive conse-
quences on neurogenesis, learning and 
memory as well as the cognitive function. 
Polyphenolic compounds are phytochemi-
cals which can decrease the reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS) production known for 
their biological antioxidant capacity and 
neuro-protective effects (29). 
Zanella et al. found that treatment with 
150 and 300 mg/kg of rosemary extract 
(hydro-alcoholic) improves new social 
short-term memory. Also, they suggested 
that treatment with 150 mg/kg of rosemary 
extract improves long-term memory when 
ordered in the consolidation phase of learn-
ing (30). 
There are two neurogenic areas in the 
brains of adults: the sub-ventricular zone 
and the sub-granular layer (in dentate gyrus 
of hippocampus). Thus, the adult brain tis-
sue has more ability for plasticity at the cel-
lular level than it was thought in the past. 
It is believed that newly formed neurons 
can play a role in learning and memory 
(31). 
In this study, the results from the probe 
test stage showed that animals in the RE 
(100mg/kg) group spent significantly more 
time in the target quadrant compared to the 
normal group. Therefore, it seems that at </p>

<p>least a part of this memory improvement is 
due to the induction of neurogenesis by RE 
in the hippocampus. Drapeau et al. found a 
quantitative relationship between neuro-
genesis and memory capability in rodents 
(32). 
Other researchers suggested that i.p in-
jection of rosemary extract for 30 days 
(100mg/kg) can have neuroprotective ef-
fects against acrylamide induced neurotoxi-
city injury (33). 
Our results showed that although treat-
ment for 12 weeks with different doses of 
RE had no significant effect on the density 
of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippo-
campus between the groups, we observed a 
14% reduction of neuron density in the RE 
group (200mg/kg) compared to the normal 
group. A research conducted in 2012, re-
vealed a clear morphological evidence of 
dose dependent (250mg and 500mg) anti-
fertility potential of rosemary in male albi-
no rats (34). Therefore, using RE in high 
doses may have destructive effects on tis-
sues. 
Antioxidant enzymes like superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase 
(GPx) and catalase (CAT) have a noticea-
ble role in the management of oxidative 
stress within the cell. Analysis of these an-
tioxidant enzymes as well as the contents of 
lipid peroxidation may yield a snapshot of 
oxidative stress (2). 
Based on the results of this study, SOD 
and CAT activities significantly increased 
in the animals in the RE (100mg/kg) group 
compared to the normal group (p&lt; 0.05 &amp; 
P&lt;0.01 respectively). Also, GPx activity 
increased significantly in RE (50 and 
100mg/kg) groups compared to the normal 
group (p&lt; 0.05 &amp; p&lt; 0.01, respectively). 
Another research found that the rosemary 
extract which is added to the diet of quails 
may alter the antioxidant activity in the liv-
er and spleen tissues (35). Also, Posadas et 
al. indicated that supplementing the diet 
with RE (CA rich) reduces oxidative stress 
in the brain tissue of the aged rats (6). 
On the other hand, our results in MDA 
level showed 13.2 % increase in the ani-</p>

<p>mals in the ER (200mg) group compared to 
the normal group. 
Devi and et al. showed that vitamin E as 
an antioxidant, not only increased the anti-
oxidant enzymes activities such as SOD, 
GPx and CAT, but also reduced MDA con-
tent in the hippocampus of the middle-aged 
rat (36). </p>

<p>Conclusion 
Our results demonstrated that administra-
tion of rosemary extract (100mg/kg) for 12 
weeks in middle-aged rats caused an in-
crease in the score of spatial memory in 
MWM test and also an increase in the ac-
tivity of SOD and CAT antioxidant en-
zymes. In addition, two doses of rosemary 
extract (50 and 100mg/kg) could increase 
the GPx activity. 
This study suggests that consumption of a 
specified dose of rosemary extract may 
have useful effects on the memorial func-
tions and the antioxidant capacity of the 
hippocampus in adolescents. </p>
