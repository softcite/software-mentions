<p>Background and purpose -Patients with osteoporosis who pres-
ent with an acute onset of back pain often have multiple fractures 
on plain radiographs. Differentiation of an acute osteoporotic ver-
tebral fracture (AOVF) from previous fractures is diffi cult. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of concomitant 
AOVFs and previous OVFs in patients with symptomatic AOVFs, 
and to identify risk factors for concomitant AOVFs. 
Patients and methods -This was a prospective epidemio-
logical study based on the Registry of Pathological Osteoporotic 
Vertebral Fractures (REPAPORA) with 1,005 patients and 2,874 
osteoporotic vertebral fractures, which has been running since 
February 1, 2006. Concomitant fractures are defi ned as at least 
2 acute short-tau inversion recovery (STIR-) positive vertebral 
fractures that happen concomitantly. A previous fracture is a 
STIR-negative fracture at the time of initial diagnostics. Logistic 
regression was used to examine the infl uence of various variables 
on the incidence of concomitant fractures. 
Results -More than 99% of osteoporotic vertebral fractures 
occurred in the thoracic and lumbar spine. The incidence of con-
comitant fractures at the time of fi rst patient contact was 26% 
and that of previous fractures was 60%. The odds ratio (OR) for 
concomitant fractures decreased with a higher number of previ-
ous fractures (OR = 0.86; p = 0.03) and higher dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry T-score (OR = 0.72; p = 0.003). 
Interpretation -Concomitant and previous osteoporotic ver-
tebral fractures are common. Risk factors for concomitant frac-
tures are a low T-score and a low number of previous vertebral 
fractures in cases of osteoporotic vertebral fracture. An MRI scan 
of the the complete thoracic and lumbar spine with STIR sequence 
reduces the risk of under-diagnosis and under-treatment. </p>

<p>■ </p>

<p>The main symptom of acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures 
(AOVFs) with or without trauma is a new onset of back pain. 
Plain radiography and a computed tomography (CT) scan of 
the thoracic and/or lumbar spine are often performed. Patients </p>

<p>with osteoporosis often show multiple fractures distributed 
over the whole spine. Differentiation of single acute and con-
comitant AOVFs from previous fractures is diffi cult, and mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most adequate image 
modality for this question. MRI may also reveal occult AOVFs 
(Park et al. 2013, Biber et al. 2016). The resources for using 
MRI are limited. In addition, it is still unclear whether using 
MRI of the spine in patients with AOVF can improve clinical 
outcome through higher diagnostic accuracy. The distribution 
of AOVFs is not well investigated, and a better understanding 
of the location of concomitant and previous fractures may lead 
to adapted and improved imaging standards. 
Considering that most osteoporotic spine fractures are 
asymptomatic, it is diffi cult to identify the symptomatic frac-
tures, especially in patients with concomitant fractures. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of 
concomitant AOVFs and previous OVFs in patients with 
symptomatic AOVFs, and to identify risk factors for concomi-
tant AOVFs. </p>

<p>Patients and methods </p>

<p>651 women and 254 men with 1,388 AOVFs and 1,486 previ-
ous vertebral fractures (in total, 2,874 OVFs) were enrolled in 
this clinical study. The prospective data acquisition was solely 
based on data from the hospital data information system. The 
data were collected from the Registry of Pathological Osteopo-
rotic Vertebral Fractures (REPAPORA), which serves health-
care research. The REPAPORA was established on February 
1, 2006. Every patient signs an informed consent document on 
admission to hospital, regarding the use of the routine clinical 
data that are acquired during standard procedures, diagnostics, 
and therapeutic measures. All the data included were derived 
from patients' primary consultations at our hospital. 
No intervention, diagnostic procedure, or therapeutic pro-
cedure was performed for study purposes. There are no </p>

<p>scheduled follow-up visits. The results of REPAPORA data 
acquisition and evaluation are re-examined regularly, and they 
have infl uenced standard operating procedures such as routine 
recommendation of bone density measurements in 2008, in-
hospital/departmental establishment of the use of dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for every patient with osteopo-
rotic fractures in 2010, establishment of a patient information 
and education system in 2011, and establishment of whole 
spine MRI in 2012. 
The inclusion criteria were acute traumatic or spontaneous 
OVFs. Patients with low levels of trauma were also included 
in the traumatic OVF group. 
Vertebral fractures were diagnosed radiologically, by radi-
ologists or spine surgeons. The clinical symptoms back pain, 
sciatica, and paresis were noted in the emergency department 
during physical examination. Sciatica was defi ned as radicular 
pain radiating out to the leg. Paresis was defi ned as a degree 
of muscular strength of Janda 4 or lower, or worsening of a 
previously known paresis by one degree of Janda. DXA or 
quantitative computed tomography (qCT) was performed to 
measure the bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and both 
femoral necks where applicable. Not all patients underwent all 
assessments. 
We defi ned concomitant AOVFs as being at least 2 acute 
STIR-positive vertebral fractures in different vertebral bodies 
(high signal) and T1w low signal in the MRI, which appear 
simultaneously (Kano et al. 2012). The concomitant fractures 
may be clinically symptomatic or asymptomatic. 
A previous fracture was defi ned as a STIR-negative verte-
bral fracture with a change in vertebral geometry of at least 
15% height reduction of the front edge of the vertebral body, 
a deformation of &gt; 20% of cover/base-plate, a lesion of the 
posterior vertebral wall, a scoliotic angle of &gt; 10°, or a mono 
or bisegmental kyphotic or lordotic angle of &gt; 15° (Ulmar et  al. 2010) (Figures 1 and 2). </p>

<p>Statistics 
Statistical analysis was carried out using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">21.0</rs>. Frac-</p>

<p>ture frequencies in the thoracic spine (1st to 9th thoracic 
vertebral body), the thoracolumbal junction (10th thoracic to 
2nd lumbar vertebral body), and the lumbar spine (3rd to 5th 
lumbar vertebral body) were recorded. Statistically signifi cant 
differences in frequencies (p &lt; 0.05) were revealed by using 
the chi-square test for independent data and Cochran's Q-test 
for dependent data. Gender differences in the distribution of 
fracture localization were expressed as frequencies and com-
pared with the chi-square test. 
In order to describe the topographic relationship between 
single acute or concomitant acute fractures and previous 
OVFs, we defi ned 5 groups: cranially adjacent fracture (an 
AOVF is situated cranially adjacent to the previous fracture), 
cranial gap fracture (an AOVF is situated cranial to the previ-
ous fracture with at least 1 healthy vertebral body between 
the 2 fractured vertebral bodies), caudal adjacent fracture (an 
AOVF is situated caudally adjacent to the previous fracture), 
caudal gap fracture (an AOVF is situated caudal to the previ-
ous fracture with at least 1 healthy vertebral body between 
the 2 fractured vertebral bodies), and pliers fracture (all verte-
bral bodies between 2 previous fractured vertebral bodies are 
acutely fractured) (Figure 3). 
Logistic regression was performed to investigate the infl u-
ence of the number of previous fractures (numeric variable), 
age (numeric variable), sex (dichotomous variable), DXA 
T-score (numeric variable), lower back pain (dichotomous: 0 
= no pain, 1 = pain), sciatica (dichotomous: 0 = no sciatica, 
1 = sciatica), paresis (dichotomous:0 = no paresis, 1 = pare-
sis), previous thoracic fractures between T1 and T9 (dichoto-
mous: 0 = no fracture, 1 = fracture), previous thoracolumbar 
fractures between T10 and L2 (dichotomous: 0 = no fracture, 
1 = fracture), and previous lumbar fractures between L3 and 
L5 (dichotomous: 0 = no fracture, 1 = fracture)-on the odds 
ratio for the onset of concomitant fractures. For this study the 
calculated odds ratios can be interpreted as an approximation 
of relative risks, as the initial risk was low and the odds ratios 
were less than 3 (Davies 1998). The goodness-of-fi t was deter-
mined with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. </p>

cal principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Study population, fracture localization, and T-score 
1,005 patients with a mean age of 78 (SD 10) years were 
included in this study. The most frequently affected age group 
was that between 75 and 84 years. 664 (66%) spontaneous 
and 311 (34%) traumatic AOVFs were detected. Information 
about clinical symptoms on admission was lacking for some 
patients. The most common symptom in patients with AOVF 
was back pain (96%). Sciatica was present in 17% of 646 
patients examined for sciatica and a paresis was found in 4% 
of individuals (Table 1). 
The most common fractured vertebral body was the L1 ver-
tebra, both in the concomitant fracture group with 268 frac-
tures and in the previous fracture group with 212 fractures. 
The most common fractured spinal region was the thoraco-
lumbar junction in-between T10 and L2, in both the concomi-
tant group with 787 fractures (57%) and the previous group 
with 740 fractures (50%). The second highest amount of 
spine fractures was observed in the lumbar region of the spine 
between L3 and L5, with 382 concomitant fractures (28%) 
and 409 previous fractures (28%) (Table 2). 
The mean T-score was −3.8 (SD 1.1, range: −7.1 to 3.0). 
The majority of patients had a T-score of between −2.5 and 
−3.4 (36%). </p>

<p>Frequency of concomitant and previous OVFs 
Of the 1,005 patients, 320 presented with a fi rst-time single 
AOVF without any previous fracture, 428 suffered from a 
single AOVF following 1 or more previous OVFs, 257 patients 
had 640 concomitant AOVFs. The total number of previous 
fractures in the study population was 1,486 in 599 patients. 
The numbers of fractures and the epidemiology of the study </p>

<p>population are given in Supplementary material. From 1,005 
study participants with AOVFs, 257 (26%) had at least 1 con-
comitant AOVF and 599 (60%) had at least 1 previous frac-
ture. Altogether, 2,874 OVFs were included in REPAPORA. 
21 patients had an acute fracture of the iliac bone and they 
were excluded from the study. </p>

<p>Dependence on the localization of concomitant frac-
tures from previous fractures 
In patients with previous fractures of the thoracic spine, the 
most frequently concomitantly affected spinal segment was 
the thoracolumbar junction (p &lt; 0.01), followed by the tho-
racic spine (p &lt; 0.01). In patients with previous osteoporotic 
fractures of the thoracolumbar junction and the lumbar spine, 
most concomitant spine fractures were located in the thoraco-
lumbar junction (p &lt; 0.01), followed by the lumbar spine (p &lt; 
0.01) (Table 3). 
The most frequent relationship between previous fractures 
and AOVFs was with the caudal gap fracture (n = 211 (25%); 
p &lt; 0.01), followed by the cranially adjacent fracture (n = 
198 (24%); p &lt; 0.01), the caudally adjacent fracture (n = 170 
(20%); p &lt; 0.01), the cranial gap fracture (n = 170 (20%); p &lt; 
0.01), and the pliers fracture (n = 58 (7.0%)). </p>

<p>A higher number of previous fractures reduces the odds 
ratio (OR) for the occurrence of concomitant fractures (OR 
= 0.86; p = 0.03). In addition, a higher DXA T-score reduced 
the OR for concomitant fractures (OR = 0.72; p = 0.003), i.e. 
patients with a lower T-score were more likely to suffer from 
concomitant fractures. Patients with previous fractures of the 
thoracic spine between T1 and T9 were less likely to suffer 
from concomitant fractures (OR = 0.47; p = 0.007). Patients 
with sciatica were less likely to suffer from concomitant frac-
tures (OR = 0.51; p = 0.04) (see, Supplementary data). The 
model used in our logistic regression was statistically signifi -
cant (omnibus test, p = 0.01) and was therefore a good pre-
dictor of concomitant fractures; the Hosmer-Lemeshow test 
showed no lack of fi t (p = 0.2). The classifi cation table showed 
that our model predicted 77% of concomitant fractures. </p>

<p>Sex differences 
Women had more concomitant fractures of the thoracic spine 
and lumbar spine than men (p &lt; 0.01), and men had a higher 
number of thoracolumbar concomitant fractures (p &lt; 0.01). </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>This study revealed that concomitant and previous fractures 
are frequently detected in patients with AOVFs. Risk factors 
for concomitant fractures were a low number of previous frac-
tures and a low T-score. AOVFs after previous fractures were 
most often caudal gap fractures. 
A prospective study on the non-operative management of 
symptomatic OVFs showed an age distribution and neuro-
logical defi cit (3% of patients) similar to the results of our 
REPAPORA study (Shah and Goregaonkar 2016). A sex 
distribution similar to REPAPORA has also been reported 
(Nolla et al. 2001). A T-score similar to what we found was 
described in a study of European women with vertebral frac-
tures (Bergot et al. 2001). The number of vertebral fractures 
included in REPAPORA is larger than in other epidemiologi-
cal studies on OVFs (Arboleya et al. 2010, Sanfelix-Genoves  et al. 2010, Herrera et al. 2015). Our study population there-
fore appears to be representative of patients with symptom-
atic AOVFs. 
Our fi ndings indicate that AOVFs occur less frequently than 
traumatic non-osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the thora-
columbar junction, and more frequently in the lumbar spine 
(Magerl et al. 1994). 
The reason for the vulnerability of the thoracolumbar junc-
tion derives from the transition from thoracic kyphosis to 
lumbar lordosis and from the change from the relatively well-
fi xed thoracic spine to the free lumbar spine (Buhren 2001). 
The defi nition of the thoracolumbar junction varies in clinical 
studies between being T10 to L2 (Knop et al. 1999, Wood et  al. 2003, Park et al. 2013) and being T11 to L2 (Buhren 2001). 
We defi ned the thoracolumbar junction as being between T10 
and L2, as this is the most frequently used extent of the tho-
racolumbar junction in clinical studies. Also, in the present 
study the L1 vertebra was the most common single acute, con-
comitant, and previously fractured vertebra, followed by T12. 
In accordance with this, the thoracolumbar junction was the 
most frequently affected fracture location. </p>

<p>Acta Orthopaedica 2017; 88 (2): 192-197 </p>

<p>We defi ned an acute single or concomitant AOVF to be when 
MRI showed a high STIR and a low T1w signal, whereas pre-
vious fractures had a low STIR and a low T1w signal. This 
is in accordance with radiological standards for differentia-
tion between acute and previous vertebral fractures (Park et al.  2013). There are still no standardized international guidelines 
for image modalities in patients with AOVFs and the German 
Osteoporosis Society (DVO) recommends plain radiographs, 
CT scan, MRI, and scintigraphy-but has not given stan-
dards (DVO 2014). If clinicians suspect concomitant or occult 
AOVFs and if patients have risk factors for concomitant frac-
tures, an MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine would appear 
to be time-and cost-effective for diagnosis of concomitant 
AOVFs, as more than 99% of all OVFs in our study occurred 
in these spinal regions. A study on multiple vertebral com-
pression fractures also recommended doing an MRI scan of 
the thoracic and lumbar spine in patients with osteoporosis 
and low back pain (Kano et al. 2012). Up to 65% of OVFs 
are overlooked if physicians rule out spine MRI (Park et al.  2013). As about 70% of osteoporotic vertebral fractures are 
asymptomatic or do not show acute onset of pain (Nevitt et al.  1998), the clinical usefulness of diagnosing a higher number 
of OVFs is questionable. 
It is generally accepted that a higher number of previous 
OVFs and a lower bone mineral density are associated with 
a higher risk of further osteoporotic fractures in general, and 
OVFs in particular (Lips 1997, Cummings and Melton 2002,  Kemmler et al. 2013). Knowing about risk factors for con-
comitant AOVFs could help physicians reduce the number of 
overlooked occult AOVFs. A high amount of previous frac-
tures decreases the risk of concomitant fractures and increases 
the risk of single AOVFs. This could be due to a high number 
of fractured and sclerosed vertebral bodies that reduce the 
number of vertebral bodies which can easily fracture simul-
taneously. 
The mechanism that leads to the lumbar drift of AOVFs fol-
lowing previous fractures is not fully understood. In studies 
on spinal load after osteoporotic vertebral wedge fractures 
treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, the most impor-
tant risk factors for subsequent vertebral fractures were the 
anterior shift of the upper adjacent vertebral body and the spi-
nopelvic imbalance, especially the segmental kyphotic angle 
(Rohlmann et al. 2006, Baek et al. 2015). This leads to an 
increased intradiscal pressure, increased endplate stress, and 
increased force in the erector spinae-and it induces increased 
spinal load with higher fracture risk in osteoporotic vertebrae 
adjacent to augmented vertebrae. Thus, adjacent fractures may 
not be caused by the altered stiffness of the polymethyl meth-
acrylate-(PMMA-)augmented vertebrae, but mainly by the 
altered mechanical spinal load (Rohlmann et al. 2006, Qin et  al. 2014). The increased vertebral load after wedge fractures 
may also be the cause of subsequent adjacent fractures in non-
augmented fractured vertebrae. This is supported by a study 
that evaluated the effect of kyphotic deformity because of a </p>

<p>wedge-shaped vertebral fracture. The authors concluded that 
a T12 vertebral body fracture leads to an increase in stress 
on adjacent vertebrae, with bimodal peaks in the midthoracic 
spine and in 2 superior vertebrae (Okamoto et al. 2015). By 
contrast, in REPAPORA the most frequent fracture following 
a previous fracture was the caudal gap fracture. The slightly 
but statistically signifi cant increase in fractures in the verte-
bral bodies below a previous fracture may be due to kyphotic 
deformity and increased spinal load in the more caudal ver-
tebral bodies, leading to the lumbar drift with more lumbar-
localized OVFs. 
The women in our study had fractures of the thoracic spine 
more frequently than men. On the other hand, men had more 
fractures of the thoracolumbar junction than women. Frac-
tures of the lumbar spine happened more frequently in women 
than men. The differences in vertebral size and morphology 
may contribute to the different risks of fracture in the thoracic, 
thoracolumbar, and lumbar spine in men and women (Bruno  et al. 2014). 
Our study had some limitations. We did not collect data on 
how previous fractures had been treated. PMMA-augmented 
patients may have had a higher number of directly adja-
cent fractures than the other patients. This may have led to 
an increased number of directly adjacent fractures. Spinal 
fusion may also change the mechanical characteristics of the 
spine and infl uence the fracture location and mechanism. In 
addition, we did not differentiate between different types of 
AOVFs, which may vary in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar 
spine and infl uence the type, frequency, and location of subse-
quent fractures. The main strength of our study was the high 
number of fractures that were investigated. We believe that the 
REPAPORA patients were a representative study population 
for symptomatic AOVFs. 
In summary, cncomitant AOVFs and previous fractures are 
common and are often overlooked. Risk factors for the occur-
rence of concomitant AOVFs are a low T-score in DXA and 
a low number of previous fractures. More than 99% of all 
OVFs happened in the thoracic and lumbar spine. We recom-
mend performing an MRI scan of the thoracic and lumbar 
spine with STIR and T1w sequences in patients with mul-
tiple AOVFs, or suspicion of concomitant AOVFs, in order 
to detect all acute concomitant fractures and start adequate 
fracture treatment. </p>
