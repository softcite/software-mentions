<p>Abstract </p>

<p>To accomplish the worldwide demand for recombinant human erythropoietin 
(rHuEpo) as a therapeutic, application of cost-efficient expression system of </p>

<p>methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) rather than mammalian </p>

<p>cells is indispensable. Herein, a report on high levels secreted-expression of </p>

<p>Pichia-derived rHuEpo by batch fermentation in a pH stabilized format is </p>

<p>presented. The full length cDNA of rHuEpo was inserted into pPICZαA vector </p>

<p>under control of AOX1 promoter, downstream of the secretion-α-factor and 
electroporated into P. pastoris strain X33. The highest expression transformant </p>

<p>was selected by screening among the colonies surviving high concentration of </p>

<p>Zeocin (1.0 mg/ml), followed by comparative small scale expression analysis </p>

<p>by ELISA. Stabilization of pH around 6.0 by adding phosphoric acid into the 
culture media during induction period, improved the yield of expression to </p>

<p>150 mg/l of the media. Single-step Nickel-affinity chromatography was </p>

<p>employed for purification of rHuEpo-6xHis to 80% purity. Analyses by SDS-
PAGE, Western blot and N-terminal protein sequencing confirmed the </p>

<p>authenticity of the 33 kDa expressed rHuEpo with a native N-terminal </p>

<p>indicating the proper cleavage of secretion-signal. Results of this study, further 
confirmed the possibility of employing methylotrophic yeast for scaled up 
production aims of rHuEpo as a cost-efficient expression system when pro-
vided evidence for higher expression yields through application of pH-
controlled systems. </p>

<p>Expression of rHuEpo in Methylotrophic Yeast </p>

<p>Avicenna Journal of Medical Biotechnology, Vol. 2, No. 4, October-December 2010 </p>



<p>efficient heterologous expression systems, ra-
ther than mammalian cells for this valuable 
drug are being explored. 
To this end, production of Epo in different 
prokaryotic hosts like Escherichia coli (E. 
coli) 
(4) and Bacillus brevis 
(5) , as well as eu-
karyotic hosts such as Saccharomyces cere-
visiae (S. cerevisiae) 
(6) and Drosophila me-
lanogaster 
(7) was described. However, since 
proper glycosylation of Epo as a hormone is 
important for some of its functional properties 
such as biological half-life 
(8) , neither prokar-
yote systems lacking the ability to glycosylate 
proteins nor microbial eukaryotes like S.cere-
visiae which hyperglycosylates proteins </p>

<p>(9) </p>

<p>could be considered as alternatives to cur-
rently exploited CHO cells for production of 
rHuEpo. 
In recent years, a few yeast species capable 
of growing on methanol as sole carbon and 
energy source have been identified and their 
application in biotechnology for high level 
and cost-efficient production of recombinant 
proteins with proper post-translational modifi-
cations were established </p>

<p>(10) </p>

<p>. These so called 
methylotrophic yeasts belong to four genera; 
Hansenula, Pichia, Candida and Torulopsis 
and their most prominent representatives are 
Hansenula polymorpha (H. polymorpha), Pi-
chia pastoris (P. pastoris), Candida boidinii 
and Pichia methanolica, respectively </p>

<p>(11) </p>

<p>. 
While H. polymorpha and P. pastoris are dis-
tinguished as industrial platforms for hetero-
logous protein production, the other two 
methylotrophic yeasts are still in the research 
level of applications </p>

<p>(12) </p>

<p>. 
Currently, the heterologous protein expres-
sion system of methylotrophic yeast "P. 
pastoris" is broadly used for production of 
many human and therapeutic proteins in 
biopharmaceuticals industries </p>

<p>(13) </p>

<p>. In fact with 
the advantages of both prokaryotic and eukar-
yotic systems and the availability of strong 
promoter for alcohol oxidase, AOX1, which is 
tightly regulated and induced by addition of 
methanol to the growth medium, P. pastoris 
provides the potential for producing correctly 
folded and properly glycosylated recombinant </p>

<p>proteins. It often allows the recombinant 
protein to be secreted in large quantities when 
it does not secrete significant amounts of 
intrinsic proteins, a phenomenon that facili-
tates downstream purification steps </p>

<p>(14) </p>

<p>. 
However, to transport the expression pro-
file of a new protein from research scale to 
industrial levels, the possibility of high level 
expression and purification yields should be 
proved. In this context, recently, expression of 
rHuEpo by P. pastoris in a batch culture sys-
tem using baffled flasks is also reported 
(2) ; 
but the expression level was shown to be as 
low as 5 mg/l. Therefore, for scaled up pro-
duction purposes, there is absolute need to 
improve expression/culturing protocols for 
much higher yields of rHuEpo expression in 
methylotrophic Pichia. 
Such optimizations may be achieved by 
exploring better vectors, host strains, and 
expression clones as well as optimizing the 
fermentation process to improve the yield and 
stability of expressed proteins by controlling 
the medium composition, pH, temperature, 
methanol induction and feed mode </p>

<p>(15) </p>

<p>. To this 
end, more recently higher production levels 
for P. pastoris-derived rHuEpo (130 mg/l) by 
Fed-batch methanol feeding strategy in the 
presence of co-substrate sorbitol was also 
described </p>

<p>(16) </p>

<p>. 
In the present study, we attempted to inves-
tigate other fermentation strategies rather than 
Fed-batch methanol feeding and sorbitol util-
ization for high yield production of rHuEpo 
by P. pastoris when simultaneously selecting 
the highest-expressing clones. In this context, 
we proposed the application of acid feeding 
strategy to keep buffering and stabilization of 
the pH around 6.0 throughout the methanol 
induction period for the selected-high expres-
sion Mut 
+ (Methanol Utilizing Positive) clone 
potentially containing multiple copies of the 
integrated vector. Results obtained in this 
study demonstrated the possibility of large 
scale production of rHuEpo in methylotrophic 
yeast by pH stabilization. 
To our knowledge, this is the second report 
on high level expression of rHuEpo in meth-</p>

<p>Construction of expression vector for secretion 
of rHuEpo in methylotrophic yeast </p>

<p>The synthetic cDNA encoding for the 166 
native amino acids of the homo sapiens Epo 
gene (NCBI accession no. NM_000799) in 
tandem with the DNA sequence of six histi-
dine amino acids (6xHis-tag) located at the C-
terminal of Epo which was synthesized and 
cloned in pUC57 plasmid (Bio Basic Inc, On-
tario, Canada) was used as template in PCR 
reactions throughout this study. For further 
direct cloning of PCR-amplified products in 
the Pichia expression vector pPICZαA (Invit-
rogen), Xho I and Xba I restriction sites were 
considered in forward (F-EPO: 5' CTCGAGA 
AAAGAGCCCCACCACGCCTCATC3') and 
reverse (R-EPO: 5' TCTAGATTATCAATG 
ATGATGATGATGATGTCTGTCCCCTGT 
CCT 3') primers, respectively (restriction sites 
are underlined). This cloning strategy pro-
vided the Kex2 cleavage site at the 5' ends of 
the DNA encoding Epo to locate the amp-
lified fragment in frame with secretion se-
quence (α-factor) under control of AOX1 pro-
moter while the 6xHis-tag and two termin-
ation triplets were located at the 3' ends in 
tandem (Figure 1). </p>

<p>DNA amplification was carried out through 
30 cycles of denaturation (30 sec at 94°C), 
annealing (35 sec at 58°C) and extension (60 
sec at 72°C), followed by a final elongation 
(10 min at 72°C) in a Perkin-Elmer thermo-
cycler. Following digestion by Xho I and Xba 
I restrictions enzymes and gel purification 
(QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, QIAgen), 
PCR-amplified fragments and PICZαA vector 
were mixed in the ligation reaction. The pro-
duct of ligation reaction was used to trans-
form E. coli TOP10 competent cells (Invit-
rogen) and developed Zeocin resistant bacter-
ial colonies were screened for the presence of 
the proper recombinant construct. The pres-
ence and accuracy of the inserted gene within 
the expression cassette in the final recom-
binant PICZαA-Epo construct was confirmed 
by both restriction analyses using Xho I and 
Xba I enzymes and DNA sequencing reac-
tions using the 5'AOX1(5'-GACT GGTTCC 
AATTGACAAGC-3') and 3'AOX1 (5'-GC 
AAATGGCATTCTGACATCC-3') primers 
(Invitrogen) which amplify the expression 
cassette together with the cloned Epo gene. </p>

<p>200 Ω), using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser ac-
cording to supplier's instructions (Easy Select 
Pichia Expression manual, Invitrogen). 
Following electroporation, cells (200 μl) 
were plated on YPDS medium (1% Yeast 
extract, 2% Peptone, 2% Dextrose, 1 M Sor-
bitol) supplemented with 100 µg/ml Zeocin 
and incubated for 3-5 days at 30°C. Zeocin-
resistant yeast transformants were further 
transferred on plates containing 1 mg/ml Zeo-
cin. Finally, colonies that survived this con-
centration of Zeocin were screened for con-
firming the methanol utilization positive 
phenotype (Mut </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>) according to the supplier's 
instructions (Invitrogen). 
Briefly, a single colony of each Zeocin re-
sistant transformants was first streaked on a 
MM (Minimal Methanol) plate and then on a 
MD (Minimal Dextrose) plate and incubated 
2 days at 30 °C. Mut 
+ transformants were 
identified through their normal growth on 
both plates within this time (in these condi-
tions Mut 
S strains only grow on the MD plate 
and show little or no growth on the MM). 
From screened Mut 
+ transformants that sur-
vived a concentration of 1 mg/ml Zeocin, 10 
colonies were randomly selected and con-
firmed for the presence of the corresponding 
Epo gene by PCR using AOX1 primers. Fi-
nally, confirmed Mut 
+ transformants were 
analyzed for expression levels in a mini scale 
(50 ml conical tubes containing 10 ml of 
culture media) and the highest expression 
clone was selected on the basis of ELISA, 
Western blot and densitometric assays on the 
culture supernatants as described in the 
analyses and quantification section in the 
following. </p>

<p>Optimization of the culturing conditions and 
purification of rHuEpo in methylotrophic yeast </p>

<p>A single colony from the highest expres-
sing clones was inoculated into 5 ml of YPD 
(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% dex-
trose) + 100 µg/ml of Zeocin medium and 
grown overnight at 28-30°C (200-250 rpm). 
The obtained seed culture was then used to 
inoculate 100 ml of BMGY medium (1% 
yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% YNB, 4 × </p>

<p>10 
-5 % biotin, 1% glycerol and 0.1 M potas-
sium phosphate, pH=6.0) in a 500 ml Erlen-
meyer flask and growth allowed to proceed at 
28-30°C (200-250 rpm) for 16 -18 hr (OD 600 
~ 5-7) . Subsequently, cells were harvested by 
centrifugation (3000 g for 4 min) and the 
pellet resuspended in 200 ml BMMY medium 
(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% YNB, 
4 × 10 
-5 % biotin, 0.5% methanol and 0.1 M 
potassium phosphate, pH=6) in 1l Erlenmeyer 
flasks to an OD 600 ~1 and incubated at 28-
30°C (250 rpm) in a floor shaking incubator 
for 72 hr. To maintain induction, sterile 100% 
methanol was added to a final concentration 
of 0.5% every 24 hr during the expression 
(post-induction). The pH was kept constant 
at 6.0 throughout the expression time by 
checking pH every 24 hr and adjusting it with 
0.1 M phosphoric acid. 
After 72 hr, the medium was centrifuged at 
10000 g for 10 min, the cell pellet was dis-
carded and the supernatant was concentrated 
10 fold and diafiltrated by Labscale TFF 
System (Millipore, USA) exploiting Pellicon 
XL50 ultrafiltration cassette equipped with 
Ultracel membrane (MWCO of 10 kDa). Dur-
ing diafiltration, the buffer of supernatant was 
exchanged with 20 mM sodium phosphate 
buffer pH=7, 0.5 M sodium chloride. Subse-
quently, expressed Epo was purified by the 
Ion Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) 
columns charged with Ni 
2+ according to the 
supplier instructions with some modifications 
(His-Trap HP affinity columns, GE Health-
care). 
In brief, each diafiltrated sample was load-
ed on a prepacked column at a flow rate 
0.8 ml/min and prewashed with 20-30 column 
volumes of equilibration buffer (20 mM so-
dium phosphate buffer pH=7, 0.5 M sodium 
chloride). Subsequently, purification column 
was washed with 10 column volumes of 
washing buffer (equilibration buffer plus 
90 mM imidazole) and then bound proteins 
were eluted with elution buffer (equilibration 
buffer plus 250 mM imidazole). Finally imid-
azole was removed by ultrafiltration using the 
exchange buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate </p>

purified Epo into this final buffer. The pur-
ified proteins were stored at -80 °C for further 
analyses. </p>

<p>Analyses and quantification methods of recom-
binant Epo protein </p>

<p>Concentrations of the expressed Epo pro-
tein in the supernatants were quantified by 
human Epo ELISA kit (CIGB, Havana, Cuba) 
according to the supplier instructions. Purified 
proteins were quantified by both ELISA and 
the Bradford method </p>

<p>(17) </p>

<p>. Protein samples 
were analyzed by the standard Laemmli SDS-
PAGE method 
(18) in a 12.5% separating gel 
and developed with silver staining. Further 
analysis of stained SDS-PAGE slabs for yield 
measurements was performed by densito-
metry using a GS-800 Bio-Rad Imaging 
Densitometer and employing <rs type="software">Quantity One 
analyzer</rs> according to the software manual. 
Western analysis was performed by electro-
blotting of proteins from SDS-PAGE gel to 
Whatman nitrocellulose membranes (Schlei-
cher &amp; Schuell). 
Tracking of the protein was achieved by 
employing the monoclonal (mouse) antibody 
against rHuEpo (CIGB, Havana, Cuba) and/ 
or monoclonal (mouse) anti-His(C-term) anti-
body (Invitrogen) as the primary and horse-
radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse 
IgG (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, 
USA) as the secondary antibody. The bands 
were developed using DAB chromogenic sub-
strate (Sigma-Aldrich). N-terminal amino acid 
sequencing was performed by Edman's deg-
radation method on the purified sample elec-
troblotted onto PVDF membrane (Institut fur 
Chemeie, Universitat fur Bodenkultur Wien, 
Austria). Cell concentrations were measured 
with a Perkin Elmer UV/VIS spectrophoto-
meter (Lambda EZ 201) based on absorbance 
at 600 nm using a calibration curve. 
Statistical analyses of the data were per-
formed using Student's t test and one-way 
multivariate ANOVA to calculate p value.

cant. </p>

<p>PICZαA-Epo expression vector and selection of 
yeast transformants </p>

<p>The human cDNA of Epo which was em-
ployed in this study encoded 166 native 
amino acids of the protein. In our cloning 
strategy, using Xho I and Xba I sites of 
pPICZαA, the cDNA of Epo was cloned in 
frame with alcohol oxidase (AOX1) trans-
cription/ translational cassette. This strategy 
inserts the Epo cDNA downstream of the 
prepro-α-factor sequence and immediately 
after the Kex-2 signal cleavage site to express 
and secrete Epo into the culture media with a 
native N terminus. Furthermore, two stop 
codons were placed immediately after the 
6xHis-tag codons for preventing of any 
ribosomal-pass through (Figure 1). 
The restriction analyses of the constructed 
recombinant Epo plasmid (Figure 2) and 
DNA sequencing analysis demonstrated the 
correct insert orientation and complete accur-
acy for the PICZαA-Epo construct without 
any unwanted mutations. 
Due to the advantages of electroporation, 
such as high frequency of transformation (es-
pecially possibility of multi-copy insertion), 
this method was employed to transform yeast 
cells by the constructed plasmid (PICZαA-
Epo). </p>

<p>Avicenna Journal of Medical Biotechnology, Vol. 2, No. 4, October-December 2010 </p>



<p>To reach the highest possible expression 
levels for our gene of interest (Epo), we pri-
marily tried to select transformants that poten-
tially may contain multiple copies of the inte-
grated vector. For this purpose, transformants 
that appeared after 3-5 days on plates con-
taining 100 µg/ml Zeocin were further trans-
ferred on plates containing 1 mg/ml Zeocin. 
Colonies that survive on such a high concen-
tration of Zeocin, potentially may contain 
multi copies of the cassette inserted into their 
genome </p>

clone for scale-up experiment was screened

sistant transformants (1 mg/ml) by culturing 
them in small scale (10 ml) for comparatively

tiple cassette insertions into the genome of 
selected transformants should be verified by 
methods like Southern blotting. </p>

<p>Optimization of media and buffering system of 
fermentation system for high level expression </p>

<p>Following the selection of best expression-
clone, scaled-up expression of Epo in unbuf-
fered media (simple: 1.34% YNB, 4 x 10 
-5 % 
biotin, 0.5% methanol) and (complex: 1% 
yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% YNB, 4 x 
10 
-5 % biotin, 0.5% methanol) was tried, but 
the expression levels were lower than 1 mg/l.

by shocking levels of [H </p>

ing yeast fermentation </p>

<p>(20) </p>

<p>. Shocking levels of 
[H </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>] may be attributed to extreme high or low 
concentrations of H 
+ that could inhibit the 
expression of the protein during fermentation. 
In fact, by the end of fermentation, utiliza-
tion of unbuffered simple medium resulted in 
extreme acidic conditions (pH=3.5), due to 
apparently production of methanol oxidized 
metabolites when on the contrary to simple 
media, the pH for the unbuffered complex 
medium resulted in extreme basic conditions 
(pH=8.5) apparently due to the production of 
ammonium via metabolizing amino acids 
existing in yeast extract and peptone. This 
finding for extremely low expression levels of 
Epo in unbuffered media prompted us to </p>

<p>evaluate the effect of different pH values on 
the level of Epo expression. 
In this context, by adjusting the pH value in 
a range of 5.0 -7.0 (with 1.0 interval) we 
found that the expression of Epo in buffered 
methanol complex medium with a pH=6.0 
was higher than other pH ranges (Figure 3A). 
Moreover we could show that stabilizing the 
pH at 6.0 throughout the expression time by 
addition of 0.1 M phosphoric acid in a batch 
format every 24 hrs, led to a considerable 
increasing of Epo expression level (150 mg/l) 
compared to unstabilized pH conditions 
(120 mg/l) (Figure 3B). 
It should be noted that a perfect stabiliza-
tion of pH may be achieved only through ap-
plication of an automatically-controlled fer-
menter that adjust the pH through continuous 
measurement of [H </p>

<p>] concentration and feed-
ing acid in a fed-batch format. However, in 
shake-flask batch system, our observations 
indicated that up to 12 hr of fermentation pH 
was around 6.5 and by 24 hr of fermentation 
was around 7.0 (still below pH=8.5 and 
shocking levels of H 
+ concentrations as 
discussed above). 
Therefore adjustment of pH every 24 hr 
could relatively fulfill the required pH stabil-
ization (around 6) in our system. A higher 
expression level of rHuEpo that obtained at 
pH 6.0 can be the result of improvement in 
the yeast growth and/or reduced activity of 
secreted proteases as previously proposed </p>

<p>Purification and characterization of methylo-
trophic yeast-expressed rHuEpo </p>

<p>Due to the designed and inserted 6xHis-tag 
at the C terminal of the expressed rHuEpo in 
the body of PICZαA-Epo construct, Ion Metal 
Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) was em-
ployed as a single-step purification of the ex-
pressed protein with a yield around 80% as 
determined by densitometry. 
As shown in figure 4, yeast-derived 
rHuEpo migrated on the SDS-PAGE gel with 
an apparent mass of 33 kDa under denaturing 
conditions and was properly detected by 
monoclonal anti-rHuEpo antibody (Figure 
4B) and monoclonal anti-His antibody (data 
not shown) in Western analyses. 
To further identify and characterize the 
protein band corresponding to 33 kDa, N-
terminal amino acid sequence analysis was 
performed on this 33 kDa band. The first 10 
N-terminal residues in the 33 kDa band were 
found to be identical to the mature amino 
acid-deduced from cDNA sequence of 
rHuEpo, i.e. APPRLI? DSR (Cys7 couldn't 
be detected directly due to its engagement in 
disulfide bond formation) and showed com-
plete processing and removal of prepro-α-
factor sequence in this band. </p>

<p>As it can be seen in figures 4A and 4B 
some notable bands in the region of 42-45kDa 
are also present in the purified fraction. With 
respect to the molecular weights of these 
bands and also their interaction with mono-
clonal anti-rHuEpo antibodies in Western blot 
analyses, these bands may indicate the unpro-
cessed pro-α-factor/ Epo proteins that resulted 
from inefficient Kex2 endoprotease process-
ing. </p>

<p>Discussion 
Although, expression of rHuEpo by P. pas-
toris in a batch culture system using baffled 
flasks was demonstrated 
(2) , their reported 
expression level was as low as 5 mg/l which 
is not an appreciated yield for scaled-up pro-
duction aims. 
The present study was undertaken to inves-
tigate possibility of application of other fer-
mentation strategies rather than fed-batch 
methanol feeding and sorbitol utilization for 
high yield production of rHuEpo by P. pas-
toris (130 mg/l) which was reported recently 
(16) and to confirm possibility of scaled up pro-
duction of rHuEpo by methylotrophic yeast. 
To our knowledge, this is the second report 
on high level expression of rHuEpo in meth-
ylotrophic yeast when the first report on opti-
mization of fermentation process through sta-
bilizing the pH and from a national point of 
view it is the first report on home-made pro-
duction of yeast-derived rHuEpo. 
While described capacities for recombinant 
protein production by P. pastoris varies from 
1 to 10000 mg/l </p>

<p>(15) </p>

<p>, expression levels for 
rHuEpo reported in the present study 
(150 mg/l) provides sufficient deserve for 
future large scale plans on methylotrophic 
yeast-derived Epo production. In fact, by 
optimizing other factors involved in the 
fermentation process of methylotrophic yeasts 
such as temperature, induction mass, metha-
nol concentration and feed mode through 
application of a controlled-continuous cul-
turing system it may be possible to attain 
much higher yields for scaled-up applications </p>

<p>like addition of detergents such as different 
Tweens (20, 40, 60, 65 or 80) and/or addition 
of co-substrates such as sorbitol even higher 
yields of expression may be achieved </p>

<p>. 
Generally high level expression of a gene 
of interest depends upon the generation and 
detection of a recombinant strain that contains 
multiple copies integrated at the AOX1 locus </p>

<p>(22) </p>

<p>. Because of the low frequency of multiple 
gene insertion events (between 1 and 10% of 
all selected Zeocin resistant transformants), 
there is a necessity of screening a large num-
ber of Zeocin-resistant transformants to locate 
these valuable clones. 
In the previous report on rHuEpo expres-
sion in P. pastoris 
(2) , the Lithium chloride 
transformation method was used to transform 
yeast cells by the recombinant plasmid, where 
as application of electroporation in our study 
provided higher transformation frequencies as 
well as higher possibility of obtaining trans-
formants with multi-copies of integrated vec-
tor (Easy Select Pichia Expression manual, 
Invitrogen). Therefore, providing a number of 
transformed colonies to be screened for their 
resistance to higher concentration of Zeocin 
(1 mg/ml), indicated the potential for the 
presence of multi-copies of expression cas-
sette integrated into the genome 
(22) and still 
possibility for selection of the best expression 
clones by ELISA among a number of screen-
ed transformants in small scale expression 
trials, enabled us to find the highest Epo pro-
ducing clone. 
Moreover, in our investigation the level of 
Epo expression was improved noticeably 
through application of a batch culturing 
strategy by adding acid to maintain the pH at 
6.0 (Figure 3B). These results are in line with 
many previous reports on the importance of 
the [H </p>

<p>] concentration and specially pH 
stabilization at 6.0 during yeast induction 
period for the highest yields of expression of 
some other heterologous proteins 
(15, 23 -26) . 
However, it is important to note that the 
optimum pH for obtaining the highest level of 
expression in P. pastoris is a protein-specific 
factor and greatly depends on physico-chem-</p>

<p>ical properties of the expressed protein that 
should be determined empirically and as a 
result, other optimum pH values have been 
already described for different proteins </p>

Celik et al 
(2) reported the apparent MW of 
32 kDa for P.pastoris expressed rHuEpo on 
the SDS-PAGE gel which was 2 kDa heavier 
than the average MW of this protein (30 kDa) 
as determined by MALDI-TOF analysis. In 
agreement with these results, our purified P. 
pastoris expressed Epo with 166 amino acids 
and 6XHis-tag (which made it about 1 kDa 
heavier) had the apparent MW of 33 kDa 
under denaturing conditions. 
As shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blot 
analyses (Figures 4A and 4B), in addition to 
the main rHuEpo band (33 kDa), some faint 
bands in the range of 42 -45 kDa were also 
detected by both anti-His and anti-Epo anti-
bodies. Incidence of these protein bands may 
be explained by occurrence of the uncleaved 
pro-α-factor/ Epo which were secreted into 
the culture media as fusion proteins. In this 
context, the variation in mobility between the 
bands in 42 -45 kDa regions may reflect dif-
ferential trimming of core oligosaccharides on 
the pro region segment; as this region con-
tains three sites for Aspargine-linked glyco-
sylation and complete or partial glycosylation 
of these sites may result to slightly different 
MWs </p>

<p>(29) </p>

<p>. The phenomenon of secretion of 
proteins in fusion with pro-α-factor into the 
media has been already reported and is the 
reflection of insufficient Kex2 endoprotease 
processing to remove the α-factor secretory 
signal from protein </p>

<p>(9, 30) </p>

<p>. 
Epo contains three complex type N-glycans 
located at asparagine (Asn) residues at pos-
itions 24, 38 and 83, and a mucin-type O-
glycan located at Ser-126. Proper glycosyla-
tion of Epo is not required for its receptor 
binding but it is however quite essential for 
elongation of its biological half-life 
(8) . Al-
though glycosylation pattern of CHO and P. 
pastoris may differ to some extent, but still 
glycosylation pattern of secreted proteins by 
P. pastoris is the most similar pattern to 
mammalian cells </p>

<p>In addition, according to recent reports on 
availability of engineered and humanized P. 
pastoris to secrete human glycoproteins with 
fully complex terminally sialylated N-glycans </p>

<p>(31) </p>

<p>, this expression system will become indis-
pensable for the production of therapeutic 
proteins such as rHuEpo. </p>

<p>Conclusion 
In summary, results of this study indicated 
that with employing a proper cloning strategy 
and screening of transformants potentially 
containing multi-copies of the integrated ex-
pression cassette as well as improving fer-
mentation conditions such as feeding acid in a 
fed-batch culturing strategy for stabilization 
of pH at 6.0, it is possible to reach yields of 
150 mg/l or higher of methylotrophic yeast-
derived rHuEpo. Data evidenced in this report 
demonstrated that P. pastoris has the potential 
for production of low-cost Epo and merits 
further scaled-up studies in more sophisti-
cated and controlled production bioreactors. </p>
