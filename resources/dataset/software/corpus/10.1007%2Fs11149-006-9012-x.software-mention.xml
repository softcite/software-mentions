<p>Abstract Traditional methods of evaluating transmission expansions focus on 
the social impact of the investments based on the current generation stock 
which may include firm generation expansion plans. In this paper, we evaluate 
the social welfare implications of transmission investments based on equilib-
rium models characterizing the competitive interaction among generation firms 
whose decisions in generation capacity investments and production are affected 
by both the transmission investments and the congestion management proto-
cols of the transmission system operator. Our analysis shows that both the 
magnitude of the welfare gains associated with transmission investments and 
the location of the best transmission expansions may change when the gener-
ation expansion response is taken into consideration. We illustrate our results 
using a 30-bus network example. </p>

<p>Within the past decade, many countries-including the US-have restructured 
their electric power industries, which essentially have changed from being domi-
nated by vertically integrated regulated monopolies (where the generation and 
the transmission sectors were jointly planned and operated) to deregulated 
industries (where generation and transmission are both planned and operated 
by different entities). Under the integrated monopoly structure, planning and 
investment in generation and transmission, as well as operating procedures, 
were, at least in theory, closely coordinated through an integrated resource 
planning (IRP) process that accounted for the complementarity and substi-
tutability between the available resources in meeting reliability and economic 
objectives. 1 The vertical separation of the generation and transmission sectors 
has resulted in a new operations and planning paradigm where IRP is no longer 
a viable alternative. Planning and investment in the privately owned generation 
sector is driven by economic considerations in response to market prices and 
incentives. The transmission system, on the other hand, is operated by inde-
pendent transmission organizations that may or may not own the transmission 
assets. Whether the transmission system is owned by the system operator as 
in the UK or by separate owners as in some parts of the US, the transmis-
sion system operator plays a key role in assessing the needs for transmission 
investments from reliability and economic perspectives and in evaluating pro-
posed investments in transmission. With few exceptions, the primary drivers for 
transmission upgrades and expansions are reliability considerations and inter-
connection of new generation facilities. 2 However, because the operating and 
investment decisions by generation companies are market driven, valuation of 
transmission expansion projects must also anticipate the impact of such invest-
ments on market prices and demand response. Such economic assessments must 
be carefully scrutinized since market prices are influenced by a variety of fac-
tors including the ownership structure of the generation sector, the network </p>

<p>1 Arguably an idealized IRP was never practical for various reasons including institutional ones, 
which prevented or delayed various transmission projects (the California-Oregon transmission pro-
ject and Devers-Palo Verde 2 project in California were cited as examples of IRP failures by one 
of the referees). 
2 In this paper, we refer to transmission upgrades driven by reliability considerations as the trans-
mission expansions that safely and reliably support increased demand and interconnections of new 
generation facilities to the grid, according to the reliability standards established by NERC, WECC, 
and Local Reliability Criteria. </p>

<p>topology, the distribution and elasticity of demand, uncertainties in demand, as 
well as generation and network contingencies. 
Existing methods for assessing the economic impact of transmission upgrades 
focus on the social impact of the investments, in the context of a competitive 
market based on locational marginal pricing (LMP), given the current genera-
tion stock. These assessments typically ignore market power effects and poten-
tial strategic response by generation investments to the transmission upgrades. 
For example, the Transmission Economic Assessment Methodology (TEAM) 
developed by the California ISO (2004) is based on the "gains from trade" 
principle (see (Sheffrin, 2005)), which ignores possible distortion due to market 
power. 3 
The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a methodology for assessing 
the economic impact of transmission investment while anticipating the strategic 
response of oligopolistic generation companies in generation investment and in 
the subsequent spot market behavior. We evaluate the social-welfare implica-
tions of transmission investments based on equilibrium models characterizing 
the competitive interaction among the generation firms whose decisions in gen-
eration capacity investments and production are affected by both the transmis-
sion investments and the congestion management protocols of the transmission 
system operator. In particular, we formulate a three-period model for studying 
how the exercise of local market power by generation firms affects the equilib-
rium between the generation and the transmission investments and, in this way, 
the valuation of different transmission expansion projects. In our model, we 
determine the social-welfare implications of transmission investments by solv-
ing a simultaneous Nash-Cournot game that characterizes the market equilib-
rium with respect to production quantities and prices. Our model accounts for 
the transmission network constraints, through a lossless DC approximation of 
Kirchoff's laws, as well as for demand uncertainty and for generation and trans-
mission contingencies. Generation firms are assumed to choose their output 
levels at each generation node so as to maximize profits given the demand func-
tions, the production decisions of their rivals and the import/export decisions by 
the system operator who is charged with maintaining network feasibility while 
maximizing social welfare. Assuming linear demand functions and quadratic 
generation cost functions the simultaneous set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) 
conditions characterizing the market equilibrium is a linear complementarity 
problem (LCP) for which we can compute a unique solution. 
We characterize a transmission planning process whose objective is to max-
imize social welfare based on the valuation methodology outlined above as </p>

<p>3 While TEAM considers alternative generation-expansion scenarios with and without the trans-
mission upgrades, as far as we know, this generation-expansion analysis is "open-loop" in the sense 
that TEAM does not take into account the potential strategic response to transmission investment 
from generation firms who may alter their investment plans in new generation capacity. Unlike the 
assumptions made in our model, two key assumptions regarding generation investment underlying 
TEAM are: (i) investment in new generation capacity is non-strategic and independent of trans-
mission planning and (ii) new investment in generation capacity is just sufficient to maintain prices 
at levels that are competitive while providing an adequate rate of return. </p>

<p>proactive network planning (PNP) since it accounts for the ability of a network 
planner to influence generation investment and the subsequent spot market 
behavior. We compare the social welfare implications of the PNP paradigm to 
two benchmark approaches: </p>

<p>(i) An ideal integrated-resource planner (IRP) who co-optimizes generation 
and transmission expansions and who dispatches generation resources and 
sets nodal energy spot prices so as to maximize social welfare. 
(ii) A "reactive" network planner (RNP) who assumes that the generation 
capacities are given, thus, ignoring the interrelationship between trans-
mission and the generation investment and optimizing the social-welfare 
impact of transmission expansions based only on the changes they induce 
in the spot market equilibrium. 4 </p>

<p>The main purpose of introducing these benchmarks is to illustrate the differ-
ences in the implied valuation of economic impact and more importantly how 
the different approaches may affect the optimal selection of transmission expan-
sion and the resulting economic consequences. 
Intuitively one expects that social-welfare gains under the PNP approach will 
be dominated by an ideal IRP but dominate the RNP. For completeness we will 
provide a formal proof of that intuitive relationship, which is also demonstrated 
numerically for a stylized 30-bus system with six generation firms. 
From a regulatory policy perspective, the above observation suggests that 
PNP can recoup some of the welfare lost due to the unbundling of the genera-
tion and the transmission investment decisions. The implication is that society 
will be better served if ISO/RTOs will play a proactive role in regional trans-
mission planning. 
The concept of a proactive network planner (PNP) was formerly proposed 
by Craft (1999) in her doctoral thesis. However, Craft only studied the optimal 
network expansion in a 3-node network that presented very particular charac-
teristics. Specifically, Craft's work assumes that only one line is congested (and 
only in one direction), only one node has demand, energy market is perfectly 
competitive, and transmission investments are not lumpy. These strong, and 
quite unrealistic, assumptions limit the applicability of Craft's results. 
While some authors have considered the effect of the exercise of local market 
power on network planning, none of them have explicitly modeled the interre-
lationship between the transmission and the generation investment decisions. 5 
In Cardell, Hitt, and Hogan (1997), Joskow and Tirole (2000), Oren (1997), 
and Stoft (1999), the authors study the implications of market power in con-
gested two-and/or three-node networks where the entire system demand is </p>

<p>4 To the extent that TEAM does not take into consideration the potential strategic response of 
generation firms in their capacity planning, it fits the RNP paradigm. 
5 In Latorre, Cruz, Areiza, and Villegas (2003), the authors present a comprehensive list of the 
models on transmission expansion planning appearing in the literature. However, none of the over 
100 models considered in that literature review explicitly considers the interrelationship between 
the transmission and the generation investment decisions. </p>

<p>concentrated in only one node. The main idea behind these papers is that if an 
expensive generator with local market power is requested to produce power 
as result of network congestion, then the generation firm owning this gener-
ator may not have an incentive to relieve congestion. Borenstein, Bushnell, 
and Stoft (2000) present an analysis of the relationship between transmission 
capacity and generation competition in the context of a two-node network in 
which there is local demand at each node. The authors argue that relatively 
small transmission investment may yield large payoffs in terms of increased 
competition. Bushnell and Stoft (1996) propose to grant financial rights (which 
are tradable among market participants) to transmission investors as reward 
for the transmission capacity added to the network and suggest a transmission-
rights allocation rule based on the concept of feasible dispatch. They prove that, 
under certain circumstances, such a rule can eliminate the incentives for a det-
rimental grid expansion. However, these conditions are very stringent. Joskow 
and Tirole (2000) analyze the Bushnell-and-Stoft's model under assumptions 
that better reflect the physical and economic attributes of real transmission net-
works. They show that a variety of potentially significant performance problems 
then arise. 
Some other authors have proposed more radical changes to the transmis-
sion power system. Alvarado and Oren (2002) and Oren, Gross, and Alvarado 
(2002), for instance, propose a transmission model in which a for-profit indepen-
dent transmission company (ITC) owns and operates most of its transmission 
resources and is responsible for operations, maintenance, and investment of 
the whole transmission system. Under this model, the ITC has the appropriate 
incentives to invest in transmission. However, the applicability of this model to 
actual power systems is complicated because this approach requires the dives-
titure and transfer to a single ITC of all transmission assets currently held by 
multiple owners. 
Recently, Murphy and Smeers (2005) have proposed a detailed two-period 
model of investments in generation capacity in restructured electricity systems. 
In this two-stage game, generation investment decisions are made in a first stage 
while spot market operations occur in the second stage. Accordingly, the first-
stage equilibrium problem is solved subject to equilibrium constraints. How-
ever, this model does not take into consideration the transmission constraints 
generally present in network planning problems. Thus, since our paper focuses 
on the social-welfare implications of transmission investments, we make use of 
a simplified version of the two-period generation-capacity investment model 
while still solving the generation-capacity equilibrium problem as an optimiza-
tion problem subject to equilibrium constraints. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the pro-
posed transmission investment model. In Sect. 3, we compare the valuation 
process of the transmission investments under the PNP paradigm with both the 
valuation process under integrated-resources planning (IRP) and the valuation 
process under the RNP paradigm. Section 4 illustrates the theoretical results 
presented in the previous section using a 30-bus network example. Conclusions 
are presented in Sect. 5. </p>

<p>2 The proactive transmission investment valuation model </p>

<p>We introduce a three-period model for studying how generation firms' local 
market power affects both the firms' incentives to invest in new generation 
capacity and the valuation of different transmission expansion projects. The 
basic idea behind this model is that the interrelationship between the generation 
and the transmission investments affects the social value of the transmission 
capacity. </p>

<p>2.1 Assumptions </p>

<p>The model assumes a general network topology, as in a typical power-flow 
formulation, with possible congestion on multiple lines. To simplify the formu-
lation, we assume, however, that all nodes are both demand and generation 
nodes and that all generation capacity at a node is owned by a single firm. How-
ever, firms can own generation capacity at multiple nodes. Generation firms 
may exercise local market power and their interaction is characterized through 
Cournot competition as detailed below. 
The model consists of three periods, as displayed in Fig. 1. We assume that, 
at each period, all previous-periods actions are observable to the players who 
base their current decisions on that information and on their "correct" rational 
expectation about the behavior of all other players in the current period and on 
subsequent period outcomes. Thus, the proactive transmission investment val-
uation model is characterized as a "complete-and perfect-information" game 6 
and the equilibrium as "sub game perfect". 
This model is static. That is, the model parameters (demand and cost func-
tions, electric characteristics of the transmission lines, etc.) do not change over 
time. One way of interpreting this model is considering that it represents an 
investment cycle with sufficient lead time between the periods while period 
3 encapsulates the average outcomes of a recurring spot energy market real-
ization under multiple demand and supply contingencies. For each realiza-
tion of demand uncertainty and transmission and generation contingencies, we 
compute the spot market equilibrium outcomes and calculate the average or </p>

<p>expected profits of the generation firms over all possible realizations. 7 All the 
costs and benefits represented in the model are annualized. 
We now explain the model backwards. The last period (period 3) represents 
the energy market operation. That is, in this period, we compute the equilib-
rium quantities and prices of electricity for given generation and transmission 
capacities. We model the energy market equilibrium in the topology of the 
transmission network through a lossless DC approximation of Kirchhoff's laws. 
Specifically, flows on lines are calculated using the power transfer distribution 
factor (PTDF) matrix, whose elements give the proportion of flow on a partic-
ular line resulting from an injection of one unit of power at any particular node 
and a corresponding withdrawal at an arbitrary (but fixed) slack bus. Different 
PTDF matrices, with corresponding state probabilities, characterize uncertainty 
regarding the realized network topology where the generation and transmis-
sion capacities are subject to random fluctuations, or contingencies, that are 
realized in period 3 prior to the production and redispatch decisions by the 
generation firms and the system operator. We will assume that the probabilities 
of all credible contingencies are public knowledge. 
As in Yao, Oren, and Adler (2004), we model the energy market equilibrium 
as a subgame with two stages. In the first stage, Nature picks the state of the 
world (and, thus, settles the actual generation and transmission capacities as 
well as the shape of the demand and cost functions at each node). In the second 
stage, firms compete in a Nash-Cournot fashion by selecting their production 
quantities so as to maximize their profit while taking as given the production 
quantities of their rivals and the simultaneous import/export decisions of a sys-
tem operator. The system operator determines import/export quantities at each 
node, taking the production decisions as given, so as to maximize social welfare 
while satisfying the energy balance and transmission constraints. In this setup, 
the production decision of the generation firms and the import/export decisions 
by the system operator are modeled as simultaneous moves. 
In the second period, each firm invests in new generation capacity, which 
lowers its marginal cost of production at any output level. For the sake of trac-
tability, we assume that generators' production decisions are not constrained 
by physical capacity limits. Instead, we allow generators' marginal cost curves 
to rise smoothly so that production quantities at any node will be limited only 
by economic considerations and transmission constraints. In this framework, 
generation expansion is modeled as "stretching" the supply function so as to 
lower the marginal cost at every output level and thus increase the amount 
of economic production at any given price. Such expansion can be interpreted 
as an increase in generation capacity in a way that preserves the proportional 
heat curve or, alternatively, assuming that any new generation capacity installed 
will replace old, inefficient plants and, thereby, increase the overall efficiency 
of the portfolio of plants in producing a given amount of electricity. This con-
tinuous representation of the supply function and generation expansion serves </p>

<p>7 It should be emphasized that the result of such calculations is different than the profits corre-
sponding to an equilibrium based on expected or average demand. </p>

<p>Proactive planning and valuation of transmission investments </p>



<p>as a proxy to actual supply functions that end with a vertical segment at the 
physical capacity limit. Since typically generators are operated so as not to hit 
their capacity limits (due to high heat rates and costly wear on the generators), 
our proxy should be expected to produce realistic results. 
The return from the generation capacity investments made in period 2 occurs 
in period 3, when such investments enable the firms to produce electricity at 
lower cost and sell more of it at a profit. We assume that, in making their invest-
ment decisions in period 2, generation firms are aware of the transmission 
expansion from period 1 and form rational expectations regarding the invest-
ments made by their competitors and the resulting expected market equilibrium 
in period 3. Thus, the generation investment and production decisions by the 
competing generation firms are modeled as a two-stage subgame-perfect Nash 
equilibrium. 
Finally, in the first period, the network planner (or system operator as in 
some parts of the US), which we model as a Stackelberg leader in our three-
period game, evaluates different projects to expand the transmission network 
while anticipating the generators' and the system operator's response in periods 
2 and 3. In particular, we consider here the case where the network planner 
evaluates a single transmission expansion decision, but the proposed approach 
can be extended to more complex investment options. 
Because the network planner under this paradigm anticipates the response 
by the generation firms, optimizing the transmission investment plan will also 
determine the best way of inducing generation investment so as to maximize the 
objective function set by the network planner (usually social welfare). There-
fore, we will use the term "proactive network planner" to describe such a plan-
ning approach which results in outcomes that, although they are still inferior to 
the integrated-resource planning paradigm, they often result in the same invest-
ment decisions. In this model, we limit the transmission investment decisions 
to expanding the capacity of any one line according to some specific transmis-
sion-planning objective (the maximization of expected social welfare in this 
case). 8 Our model allows both the upgrades of existing transmission lines and 
the construction of new transmission lines. Transmission upgrades that affect 
the electric properties of lines will obviously alter the PTDF matrices. Conse-
quently, our model explicitly takes into consideration the changes in the PTDF 
matrices that are induced by alterations in either the network structure or the 
electric characteristics of transmission lines. 
Since the energy market equilibrium will be a function of the thermal capac-
ities of all constrained lines, the Nash equilibrium of generation capacities will 
also be a function of these capacity limits. The PNP, then, has multiple ways of 
influencing this Nash equilibrium by acting as a Stackelberg leader who antici-
pates the equilibrium of generation capacities and induces generation firms to 
make more socially optimal investments. </p>

<p>8 "Expected social welfare" is defined as the sum of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and 
congestion rent that is expected before the realization of the spot market. </p>



<p>E. E. Sauma, S. S. Oren </p>

<p>We further assume that the generation cost functions are both increasing 
and convex in the amount of output produced and decreasing and convex in 
the generation capacity. Furthermore, as we mentioned before, we assume that 
the marginal cost of production at any output level decreases as the genera-
tion capacity increases. Moreover, we assume that both the generation capacity 
investment cost and the transmission capacity investment cost are linear in 
the extra-capacity added. We also assume downward-sloping, linear demand 
functions at each node. To further simplify things, we assume no wheeling fees. </p>

<p>2.3 Formulation </p>

<p>We start by formulating the third-period problem. In the first stage of period 3, 
Nature determines the state of the world. In the second stage, for a given state c, 
generation firm G (G ∈ ) solves the following profit-maximization problem: </p>

operator solves the following welfare maximizing redispatch problem (for the

<p>Given that we assume no wheeling fees, the system operator can gain social 
surplus, at no extra cost, by exporting some units of electricity from a cheap-
generation node while importing them to other nodes until the prices at the 
nodes are equal, or until some transmission constraints are binding. 
The previously specified model assumptions guarantee that both (1) and (2) 
are concave programming problems, which implies that first order necessary 
conditions (i.e. KKT conditions) are also sufficient. 10 Consequently, to solve 
the period-3 problem (energy market equilibrium), we can just jointly solve the 
KKT conditions of the problems defined in (1), for all G ∈ , and (2), which 
together form a LCP that can be solved with off-the-shelf software packages. 
The KKT conditions for the problems defined in (1) are: </p>

<p>10 An important implication of the assumptions made in Sect. 2.1 is that the problems defined in 
(1) and (2) are concave maximization problems over convex sets and hence yield a unique equilib-
rium. We recognize that these assumptions may not hold under practical circumstances (e.g. when 
startup costs, no load costs and minimum load constraints are taken into consideration). </p>

In period 2, each firm determines how much to invest in new generation 
capacity by maximizing the expected value of the investment (we assume risk-
neutral firms) subject to (3)-(16), which represent the anticipated actions in 
period 3. Since the investments in new generation capacity reduce the expected </p>

<p>marginal cost of production, the return from the investments made in period 2 
occurs in period 3. Thus, in period 2, each firm G (G ∈ ) solves the following

<p>The problem defined in (17) is a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Con-
straints (MPEC) problem. 11 Thus, the period-2 problem can be converted 
to an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC), in which 
each firm faces (given other firms' commitments and the system operator's 
import/export decisions) an MPEC problem. However, this EPEC is con-
strained by a non-convex region and, therefore, we cannot simply write down 
the first order necessary conditions for each firm and aggregate them into a large 
problem to be solved directly. In Sect. 4, we solve this problem for the particular 
case-study network, using a sequential quadratic programming algorithm. 
In the first period, the network planner evaluates different transmission 
expansion projects. In this period, the network planner is limited to deciding 
which line (among both the already existing lines and some proposed new lines) 
should be upgraded, and what should be the transmission capacity for that line, 
in order to maximize the expected social welfare subject to the equilibrium 
constraints representing the anticipated actions in periods 2 and 3. 12 Thus, in 
period 1, the PNP's social-welfare-maximizing problem is: </p>

<p>We will not attempt to solve this problem, but rather use this formulation 
as a framework for evaluating alternative predetermined transmission expan-
sion proposals. For that purpose, we will only focus on the benefit portion of the 
objective function in (18), which can be contrasted with the transmission invest-
ment cost. In our case study, we will only compare benefits, which is equivalent </p>

<p>12 No attempt is made here to co-optimize the network planner/system operator's transmission 
expansion and redispatch decisions. We assume that the transmission planning function treats the 
real-time redispatch function as an independent follower and anticipates its equilibrium response 
as if it was an independently controlled entity with no attempt to exploit possible coordination 
between transmission planning and real-time dispatch. One should keep in mind, however, that 
such coordination might be possible in a for-profit system operator enterprise such as in the UK. </p>

<p>3 Theoretical results </p>

<p>In the previous section, we formulated the transmission investment valuation 
model used by a PNP. In this section, we present a comparative static analysis 
comparing the valuations of transmission investment projects from a PNP per-
spective with the corresponding valuations under the IRP paradigm and under 
the RNP paradigm. We formally show that the expected social welfare gains 
under the IRP and the RNP plans provide upper and lower bounds for the 
objective-function value corresponding to the optimal PNP plan. It should be 
noted, however, that the optimal decision itself may vary in an unpredictable 
way among the three planning paradigms. Indeed, in our numerical example 
(in Sect. 4), it turns out that the best investment alternative for the RNP is the 
same as for the IRP (although the welfare gains are different) but it is different 
for the PNP. 
In order to facilitate the comparison, we first introduce mathematical for-
mulations of both the IRP and the RNP transmission investment valuation 
models. </p>

<p>3.1 Integrated-resources planner (IRP) model </p>

<p>In this model, we assume that the generation and the transmission sectors are 
jointly planned and operated by the IRP. That is, the IRP not only jointly plans 
generation and transmission expansions, but it also performs the energy market 
operations. Thus, the IRP can incorporate the system-wide effects (operational 
and investment complementarities and substitutabilities between the genera-
tion and the transmission sectors), when making operations and investment 
decisions, in order to obtain a more socially efficient outcome. The IRP model 
consists of two periods: A and B. The last period (period B) corresponds to the 
energy market operation and it is modeled as a subgame with two stages. While 
Nature picks the state of the world in the first stage, the IRP chooses genera-
tion quantities and redispatch amounts (for the given state of the world) in the 
second stage so that social welfare is maximized. That is, the IRP solves the 
following social-welfare-maximizing problem (for a given state c) in period B: </p>

<p>13 By ignoring transmission investment costs when evaluating the economic impact of a trans-
mission upgrade, we provide an upper limit on the economic investment costs. Obviously when 
comparing alternative investment plans, net benefits which account for the investment cost, should 
be considered. </p>

<p>3.2 Reactive network planner (RNP) model </p>

<p>In this model, the network planner selects the social-welfare-maximizing loca-
tion and magnitude for transmission upgrades assuming a fixed generation stock </p>



<p>E. E. Sauma, S. S. Oren </p>

<p>(which will typically account for firm generation investment plans), while antic-
ipating the effect of the transmission upgrades on the energy market. This model 
has the same structure as the PNP model with the exception that the objective 
function used to evaluate alternative transmission upgrades in period 1 assumes 
that the generation stock upon which the energy market equilibrium is based 
is the current one. Thus, the third period equilibrium is again characterized 
by (3)-(16) with generation cost functions set based on the current generation 
stock. In other words, the RNP does not take into consideration the potential 
effect that its decisions could have on generation investment decisions in period 
2 and assumes that generation capacities do not change. Thus, the RNP solves 
the following social-welfare-maximizing problem in the first period: </p>

<p>3.3 Transmission investment valuation models comparison </p>

<p>Now, we compare the optimal transmission investment decisions made for a 
PNP with corresponding optimal decisions of an IRP and a RNP. </p>

<p>Proposition 1: The optimal expected social welfare obtained from the IRP model 
is never smaller than the optimal expected social welfare obtained from the PNP 
model. </p>

<p>Proof By comparing (18) and (19), we observe that both problems maximize 
the same objective function and that all the constraints of the problem defined 
in (19) are included as constraints in the problem defined in (18). Moreover, the 
problem defined in (18) considers some other constraints. Thus, the feasible set 
of (18) is a subset of the feasible set of (19). Consequently, since both (18) and 
(19) maximize the same objective function, the optimal solution of (18) must 
be in the feasible set of (19), which implies that the optimal solution to (19) 
cannot be worse (in terms of expected social welfare) than the optimal solution 
of (18). </p>

<p>Proposition 2: The optimal expected social welfare obtained from the PNP 
model is never smaller than the optimal expected social welfare obtained from 
the RNP model. </p>

<p>Fig. 2 Optimal transmission investments in the PNP and the RNP models </p>

<p>Proof By comparing (18) and (20), we observe that, if we eliminated the 
last constraint of each problem (second-period problem conditions), then both 
problems would be identical. Thus, there exists a correspondence from genera-
tion capacities space to transmission capacities space, f *(g), that characterizes 
the "unconstrained" optimal investment decisions of both the PNP and the 
RNP. In Fig. 2, this correspondence is represented by the solid curve. 14 Since 
the second periods of both models are identical, there also exists a correspon-
dence from transmission capacities space to generation capacities space, g  *  (f ), 
that characterizes the generation-firms' optimal response to transmission invest-
ments under both the PNP and the RNP models. In Fig. 2, this correspondence 
is represented by the dashed curve. The optimal solution of the PNP model is at 
the intersection of these two correspondences. That is, the transmission capacity 
chosen by the PNP, f  *  
PNP , is such that f  *  (g  *  (f  *  
PNP )) = f  *  
PNP . On the other hand, 
the transmission capacity chosen by the RNP, f  *  
RNP , is on the correspondence 
f  *  (g), at the currently installed generation capacities (i.e., f  *  
RNP = f  *  (g 0 )), as 
Fig. 2 suggests). Thus, the optimal solution of the second period of the RNP 
model is on the correspondence g  *  (f ), at transmission capacities f  *  
RNP . Since 
the correspondence g  *  (f ) characterizes the optimality conditions of the period-
2 problem in the PNP model, any pair (g  *  (f ), f ) represents a feasible solution of 
the PNP model. Consequently, the optimal solution of the RNP model,(g  *  (f  *  
RNP ), 
f  *  
RNP ), is a feasible solution of the PNP model, as it is evident in Fig. 2. There-
fore, the optimal solution of (18) cannot be worse (in terms of expected social 
welfare) than the optimal solution of (20). </p>

<p>Note that the previous two propositions are also valid under a different trans-
mission-planning objective (other than expected social welfare). Consequently, 
we can generalize the previous propositions as in the following statement: 
"Under any transmission-planning objective, the optimal value obtained from 
the PNP model is both never larger (better) than the optimal value obtained </p>

<p>14 In Fig. 2, for the sake of clarity, we assume all correspondences are simple functions on the 
space of transmission/generation capacities. </p>



<p>E. E. Sauma, S. S. Oren </p>

<p>from the IRP model and never smaller (worse) than the optimal value obtained 
from the RNP model". 
While Proposition 2 states that a RNP cannot do better (in terms of expected 
social welfare) than a PNP, the sign of the inefficiency is not evident. That 
is, without adding more structure to the problem, it is not evident whether 
the network planner underinvests or overinvests in transmission under the 
RNP model, relative to the PNP investment levels. To establish such compara-
tive static results, we need a more structured characterization of the transmis-
sion investment models solutions, which requires some extra assumptions in 
the transmission investment models. In particular, we assume that there exist 
some continuous and differentiable functions that characterize the transmis-
sion investment models equilibria. This assumption is valid for small changes in 
transmission and generation capacities (as long as the changes do not alter the 
electric characteristic of the lines, i.e., as long as we can assume that the PTDFs 
are constant). Unfortunately, generation and transmission investments tend to 
be lumpy, which means that most upgrades produce large changes in generation 
and transmission capacities. However, the only purpose of our continuity and 
differentiability assumptions is to illustrate, in a simple way, that it is possible 
to use our 3-period transmission investment model to derive some sufficient 
conditions under which we can guarantee the sign of the inefficiency of the 
RNP model relative to the PNP model. 
The optimal solution to the period-3 problem is a function of both the capac-
ities of generators and the capacities of lines. 15 Accordingly, the Nash equi-
librium of generation capacities will be a function of the thermal capacities of 
all constrained lines. Consequently, if the cardinality of N and L are n and m 
respectively, and f is the vector of expected thermal capacities of all the lines 
(i.e., f = [f 1 , . . ., f m ] T ), then we can define g  *  
i (f ) as the period-2 Nash-equi-
librium expected capacity of the generator located at node i (i ∈ N), g  *  (f ) as 
the vector of all period-2 Nash-equilibrium expected generation capacities (i.e., 
g  *  (f ) = [g  *  
1 (f ), . . ., g  *  
n (f )] T ), q c *  
i (g  *  (f ), f ) as the optimal quantity generated at 
node i in state c during period 3, and r c *  
i (g  *  (f ), f ) as the optimal adjustment 
quantity into/from node i by the system operator in state c during period 3. As 
we mentioned before, we assume that g  *  , q c *  
i and r c *  
i are all continuous and 
differentiable in all variables. 16 
Assuming that q c *  
i and r c *  
i are given continuous and differentiable functions, 
we can re-formulate (17) as the following unconstrained problem: </p>

<p>15 To be rigorous, we should say that the period-3 problem solution is also a function of both the 
network structure and the electric characteristics of all transmission lines. 
16 In our model, q c *  
i and r c *  
i are continuous and differentiable in g  *  
j (∀j ∈ N) because we assumed 
no upper limit in the generated quantities. To justify the continuity and differentiability with respect 
to f l (∀l ∈ L), we can argue that it is possible to relax the transmission capacity constraints while 
introducing some adequate penalty functions into the objective function of the problem defined in 
(2). </p>

<p>Equation (22) indicates that the value of additional generation capacity to a 
firm depends on the capacity levels of all the other generators and the transmis-
sion capacities of all lines in the network. Moreover, (22) means that, under the 
existence of local market power, generation firms will not invest so as to just 
equate the expected reduction in the marginal cost of production and the mar-
ginal investment cost (i.e., the last two terms in (22)). On the contrary, firms will 
invest in generation capacity taking into account the effect of their investments 
on the energy market equilibrium.

<p>Now, we are able to establish some sufficient conditions under which we can 
guarantee the sign of the RNP's inefficiency in transmission investments as 
compared with the investment levels under the PNP model. </p>

<p>Proposition 3: Suppose that the gain in expected welfare of an incremental unit 
of generation capacity is greater (smaller) than the marginal investment cost for 
those generation firms whose generation capacities are strategic complements 
(substitutes) to the transmission capacity at the optimal location of the transmis-
sion upgrade. Furthermore, assume that the optimal location of the transmission 
upgrade is the same under both the RNP model and the PNP model. Then, the 
RNP will underinvest in transmission capacity as compared to the PNP. </p>

<p>Proof Let q c *  
i and r c *  
i (∀i ∈ N, c ∈ C) define an optimal solution for the third 
period of the RNP model. Then, for given functions q c *  
i and r c *  
i (∀i ∈ N, c ∈ C), 
any optimal solution to the first-period optimization of the RNP model must 
satisfy the following first order optimality condition (for some optimal ∈ L): </p>

dition of the period-1 problem of the PNP model, as follows (assuming that the

both the RNP model and the PNP model): </p>

<p>(25) </p>

<p>The previous optimality condition undoubtedly shows that the PNP alters its 
actions (as compared to an RNP) in order to recapture some of the social 
welfare lost due to the socially inefficient generation capacity investments. 
Using (25), it follows directly from the proposition assumptions that the 
"period-2 Nash-equilibrium enhancement effect" made by the PNP is positive, 
which implies that the RNP will underinvest in transmission capacity as com-
pared to the PNP (assuming that the optimal location of the next transmission 
upgrade is the same under both the RNP model and the PNP model). </p>

<p>Equation (25) reflects how the PNP differs from its reactive counterpart 
(i.e., from a network planner that ignores the dependency of the equilibrium of </p>

<p>Proactive planning and valuation of transmission investments </p>



<p>generation capacities on the transmission capacities). In addition to the welfare 
gained directly by adding transmission capacity, which by definition corresponds 
to the sum of all the shadow prices of the transmission constraints, the PNP 
also considers how its investment can induce a more socially efficient Nash 
equilibrium of expected generation capacities. In fact, it includes a "period-2 
Nash-equilibrium enhancement effect" into the social value of transmission 
capacity. Although the sign of this effect is not evident in general, proposition-3 
assumptions guarantee a positive sign. 
The three previous propositions deal with the transmission investment deci-
sions made under the different paradigms. It is also interesting to analyze what 
can be said about the generation investment decisions made under the corre-
sponding models. The next proposition sets up some sufficient conditions under 
which we can guarantee that a generation firm will underinvest under either 
the PNP or the RNP paradigm as compared to investment levels implied by the 
IRP. </p>

<p>Proposition 4: Under either the PNP model or the RNP model, if a firm owning 
generation capacity at a single node expands its capacity such that its expected 
marginal profit is smaller than the expected marginal welfare gain corresponding 
to the IRP's optimal decision, then the generation firm underinvests relative to 
the IRP's optimal investment level at that node. </p>

<p>Proof Let q cIRP </p>

<p>Fig. 3 30-bus Cornell network </p>

<p>4 Case study </p>

<p>We illustrate the theoretical results derived in the previous section using a 
stylized version of the 30-bus/3-zone network displayed in Fig. 3, which was 
developed at Cornell University for experimental economic studies of electric-
ity markets (http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/powerweb). There are six generation 
firms in the market (each one owning the generation capacity at a single node). 
Nodes 1, 2, 13, 22, 23, and 27 are the generation nodes. There are 39 transmission 
lines. The electric characteristics of the transmission lines are listed in Table 7 
in the Appendix. 
The uncertainty associated with the energy market operation is classified 
into seven independent contingent states (see Table 1). Six of them have small 
independent probabilities of occurrence (two involve demand uncertainty, two 
involve network uncertainty and the other two involve generation uncertainty). 
Table 2 shows the nodal information in the normal state. 
We assume the same production cost function, CP c 
i (·), for all generators and 
all contingencies. Note that CP c 
i (·) is increasing in q c 
i , but it is decreasing in g c 
i . 
Moreover, recall that we have assumed that generators have unbounded capac-
ity (i.e., they never reach the upper generation capacity limit). Thus, the only 
important effect of investing in generation capacity is lowering the production 
cost. Moreover, we assume that all generation firms have the same investment 
cost function, given by CIG i (g i , g 0 
i ) = 8·(g i −g 0 
i ), in dollars. The before-period-2 </p>

<p>expected generation capacity is assumed to be the same for all generation nodes 
and equal to 60 MW (i.e., g 0 
i = 60 MW ∀i ∈ 1, 2, 13, 22, 23, 27). For our purposes, 
the choice of the parameter g 0 
i is not important because the focus of this paper 
is not generation adequacy. Instead, what we are really interested in is the ratio 
(g 0 
i /g i ) since we focus on the cost of generating power and the effect that both 
generation and transmission investments have over that cost. 
As mentioned before, the KKT conditions of the period-3 problem of the 
PNP model constitute a LCP. We solve it, for each contingent state, by minimiz-
ing the complementarity conditions subject to the linear equality constraints 
and the non-negativity constraints. 17 The period-2 problem of the PNP model 
is an EPEC, in which each firm faces a Mathematical Program subject to Equi-
librium Constraints (MPEC). 18 We attempt to solve for equilibrium, if at least 
one exists, by iterative deletion of dominated strategies. That is, we sequentially 
solve each firm's profit-maximization problem using as data the optimal values 
from previously solved problems. Thus, starting from a feasible solution, we 
solve for g 1 using g (−1) as data in the first firm's optimization problem (where 
g (−1) means all firms' generation capacities except for firm 1's), then solve for </p>

<p>17 Recall that any LCP can be written as the problem of finding a vector x ∈ n such that 
x = q + M · y, x T · y = 0, x ≥ 0, and y ≥ 0, where M ∈ n×n , q ∈ n , and y ∈ n . Thus, we can 
solve it by minimizing x T · y subject to x = q + M · y, x ≥ 0, and y ≥ 0. If the previous problem 
has an optimal solution where the objective function is zero, then that solution also solves the 
corresponding LCP. Greater details about the methodology used for solving LCPs are given in 
(Hobbs, 2001). 
18 See (Yao et al., 2004) for definitions of both EPEC and MPEC. </p>

<p>g 2 using g (−2) as data, and so on. We solve each firm's profit-maximization 
problem using a sequential quadratic programming algorithm implemented in 
<rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> . 
We test our model from a set of different starting points and using different 
generation-firms' optimization order. All these trials gave us the same results. 
For the PNP model, the optimal levels of generation capacity under absence 
of transmission investments are (g  *  
1 , g  *  
2 , g  *  
3 , g  *  
4 , g  *  
5 ,g  *  
6 ) = (100.92, 103.72, 101.15, 
95.94, 77.07, 87.69) in MW. Table 3 lists the corresponding generation quanti-
ties (q i ), adjustment quantities (r i ) and nodal prices (P i ) in the normal state. 
Figure 4 illustrates these results for the Cornell network. In Fig. 4, thick lines 
represent the transmission lines reaching their thermal capacities (in the indi-
cated direction) and circles are located in the nodes with the highest prices 
(above $48/MWh). 
To evaluate the period-1 objective-function value corresponding to a trans-
mission line expansion in the PNP model, we solve a period-2 problem that 
considers the new network data to solve the energy market equilibrium at </p>

<p>period 3. We then compare the values obtained for alternative line expansions 
and identify the one producing the highest expected social welfare gain. For 
simplicity, we do not consider transmission investment costs. Thus, the values 
obtained establish upper limits on the economic investment in each line expan-
sion (not accounting for reliability considerations). 
The four congested lines in the normal state, in absence of transmission 
investment, are obvious candidates for the single-line upgrade. We tested the 
PNP decision by comparing the results of independently adding 100 MVA of 
capacity to each one of these four lines and to four new lines. 19 The results are 
summarized in Table 4. In assessing the economic impacts of the alternative 
line expansions, we compare social-welfare implications along with the impact 
on market power (measured by an average Lerner index 20 ), producer and </p>

<p>19 For simplicity, in the case of upgrading an existing line, we assume that the upgrade does not 
alter the electric characteristics, but only the thermal capacity of the line (for instance, this would be 
the case if, for the expanded line, we replaced all the wires by "low sag wires" while using the same 
existing high-voltage towers). On the other hand, in the case of building a line at a new location, 
we consider that the PTDF matrices change according to both the new network structure and the 
electric characteristics of the new line. For all new-line expansion projects, we evaluate the impact 
of the construction of a transmission line with thermal capacity equal to 100 MVA, resistance equal 
to 0.01 p.u., and reactance equal to 0.04 p.u. 
20 The Lerner Index is defined as the fractional price markup i.e. (Price − Marginal cost)/Price. </p>

<p>consumer surplus as well as congestion rents. In Table 4, "Avg. L" corresponds 
to the expected Lerner index averaged over all generation firms, "P.S." is the 
expected producer surplus of the system, "C.S." is the expected consumer sur-
plus of the system, "C.R." represents the expected congestion rents over the 
entire system, "W" is the expected social welfare of the system, and "g  *  " cor-
responds to the vector of all Nash-equilibrium expected generation capacities. 
From Table 4, it is evident that the highest valued (in terms of expected social 
welfare) single transmission line expansion is a new line connecting nodes 20 
and 22. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that some expansion projects (as 
adding 100 MVA on line 15-18) can decrease social welfare. 
Now, we are interested in comparing the PNP "best expansion" with that 
obtained under the RNP paradigm for the same system conditions. We tested 
the RNP decision by comparing the results of independently adding 100 MVA 
of capacity to each one of the same (existing and new) eight lines as before. The 
results are summarized in Table 5, where we use the notation x to represent the 
value of x as seen by the RNP. 
From Table 5, it is clear that the social-welfare-maximizing transmission 
expansion for the RNP is, in this case, a new transmission line connecting nodes 
18 and 27. In evaluating the "true outcome" corresponding to the RNP best 
choice, we do take into consideration the generation investment response to 
that "suboptimal" choice and the subsequent energy market equilibrium, which 
result in Avg. L = 0.569, P.S. = $3,052.8/h, C.S. = $588.5/h, C.R. = $37.5/h, W = 
$3,678.8/h, and g  *  = (101.01, 103.80, 102.41, 103.57, 84.36, 96.12) in MW. By com-
paring Tables 4 and 5, it is evident that the optimal investment decision under 
the PNP paradigm differs from the optimal investment decision corresponding 
to the RNP. Specifically, the PNP considers not only the welfare gained directly 
by adding transmission capacity (on which the RNP bases its valuations), but 
also the way in which its investment induces a more socially efficient Nash 
equilibrium of expected generation capacities. 
Finally, it is interesting to compare the results obtained with the PNP model 
and those obtained with an hypothetical IRP. We tested the IRP decisions by 
comparing the results of independently adding 100 MVA of capacity to each 
one of the same eight lines as before. The results are summarized in Table 6. </p>

<p>Proactive planning and valuation of transmission investments </p>



<p>From Table 6, it is clear that the social-welfare-maximizing transmission 
expansion for the IRP is, in this case, a new line connecting nodes 18 and 27. 
By comparing Tables 4, 5 and 6, we observe that the IRP is able to significantly 
increase the expected social welfare with respect to the PNP and the RNP. This 
is because the IRP not only jointly plans generation and transmission expan-
sions, but it also chooses generation quantities and redispatch amounts in order 
to maximize the expected social welfare of the whole system. It is also inter-
esting to note that the producer surplus under every expansion project studied 
here is negative due to the fact that the IRP controls all the decision variables. </p>

<p>5 Conclusions </p>

<p>In this paper, we evaluated the social welfare implications of transmission 
investments based on equilibrium models characterizing the competitive inter-
action among generation firms whose decisions in generation capacity invest-
ments and production are affected by both the transmission investments and 
the congestion management protocols of the transmission network planner. In 
particular, we proposed a three-period model for studying how the exercise of 
local market power by generation firms affects the equilibrium between the 
generation and the transmission investments and, in this way, the valuation 
of different transmission expansion projects. We showed that, although a PNP 
cannot do better (in terms of expected social welfare) than an IRP, it can recoup 
some of the lost welfare by identifying transmission investment options that are 
ex-post optimal given the strategic investment response by generation compa-
nies. We also proved that a RNP cannot do better (in terms of expected social 
welfare) than the PNP. Moreover, we illustrated through a numerical example 
that the valuations of transmission investments under the RNP paradigm can 
result in the selection of transmission expansion options that are inferior to 
those selected based on the PNP valuation, given the generation investment 
response to such expansions. Indeed, the PNP valuation methodology can iden-
tify more socially efficient expansion options than the RNP because it takes 
into consideration not only the welfare gained directly by adding transmission 
capacity, but also the way in which the transmission investment alters the Nash 
equilibria of expected generation capacities. 
While the PNP paradigm is still inferior to IRP, which co-optimizes transmis-
sion and generation expansion, the reality is that IRP is no longer a relevant 
methodology in a system where generators are privately owned and invest-
ment decisions in generation are not centrally coordinated and arguably was 
never practical due to institutional barriers that prevailed in the vertically inte-
grated utility regime. On the other hand, the PNP paradigm can be readily 
implemented as part of an economic assessment methodology employed by 
system operators. Such implementation requires, however, that transmission 
planning be centralized in a regional organization such as an ISO, an RTO or a 
regional performance-based-regulated ITC who will take the lead in identify-
ing investment priorities. In doing so, the planner is able to respond to current </p>

<p>needs and also guide future generation investment in the public interest. This 
view is contrary to the prevailing generation-centric view that gives priority to 
market-driven generation investment decisions and to merchant transmission 
investments while the ISO/RTO plays a passive (reactive) role. In this role the 
ISO/RTO evaluates transmission investment proposals as they come in and 
supplements them as needed to meet reliability requirements dictated by load 
growth and new generation investments. Unfortunately, this reactive approach 
is likely to lead to piece mill investment in the transmission infrastructure that 
is likely to be socially suboptimal in the long run. </p>
