<p>Background </p>

<p>Loss to follow-up from randomised trials can introduce bias and reduce study power, affecting the generalisability, validity and reliability 
of results. Many strategies are used to reduce loss to follow-up and improve retention but few have been formally evaluated. </p>

<p>Objectives </p>

<p>To quantify the effect of strategies to improve retention on the proportion of participants retained in randomised trials and to investigate 
if the effect varied by trial strategy and trial setting. </p>

<p>Search methods </p>

<p>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, 
DARE, CINAHL, Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register, and ERIC. We 
handsearched conference proceedings and publication reference lists for eligible retention trials. We also surveyed all UK Clinical Trials 
Units to identify further studies. </p>

<p>Selection criteria </p>

<p>We included eligible retention trials of randomised or quasi-randomised evaluations of strategies to increase retention that were 
embedded in 'host' randomised trials from all disease areas and healthcare settings. We excluded studies aiming to increase treatment 
compliance. </p>

<p>Data collection and analysis </p>

<p>We contacted authors to supplement or confirm data that we had extracted. For retention trials, we recorded data on the method 
of randomisation, type of strategy evaluated, comparator, primary outcome, planned sample size, numbers randomised and numbers 
retained. We used risk ratios (RR) to evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of strategies to improve retention. We assessed heterogeneity 
between trials using the Chi 2 and I 2 statistics. For main trials that hosted retention trials, we extracted data on disease area, intervention, 
population, healthcare setting, sequence generation and allocation concealment. </p>

Strategies to improve retention in randomised trials (Review) 
We identified 38 eligible retention trials. Included trials evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention. These were incentives, 
communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural and methodological interventions. 
For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaires with or without medical test kits. For four 
trials, retention was the number of participants remaining in the trial. Included trials were conducted across a spectrum of disease areas, 
countries, healthcare and community settings. Strategies that improved trial retention were addition of monetary incentives compared 
with no incentive for return of trial-related postal questionnaires (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28, P value &lt; 0.0001), addition of an 
offer of monetary incentive compared with no offer for return of electronic questionnaires (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38, P value &lt; 
0.00001) and an offer of a GBP20 voucher compared with GBP10 for return of postal questionnaires and biomedical test kits (RR 
1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22, P value &lt; 0.005). The evidence that shorter questionnaires are better than longer questionnaires was unclear 
(RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P value = 0.07) and the evidence for questionnaires relevant to the disease/condition was also unclear 
(RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). Although each was based on the results of a single trial, recorded delivery of questionnaires seemed to 
be more effective than telephone reminders (RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.87, P value = 0.02) and a 'package' of postal communication 
strategies with reminder letters appeared to be better than standard procedures (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67, P value &lt; 0.0001). An 
open trial design also appeared more effective than a blind trial design for return of questionnaires in one fracture prevention trial (RR 
1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63, P value = 0.0003). </p>

<p>There was no good evidence that the addition of a non-monetary incentive, an offer of a non-monetary incentive, 'enhanced' letters, 
letters delivered by priority post, additional reminders, or questionnaire question order either increased or decreased trial questionnaire 
response/retention. There was also no evidence that a telephone survey was either more or less effective than a monetary incentive and 
a questionnaire. As our analyses are based on single trials, the effect on questionnaire response of using offers of charity donations, 
sending reminders to trial sites and when a questionnaire is sent, may need further evaluation. Case management and behavioural 
strategies used for trial retention may also warrant further evaluation. </p>

<p>Authors' conclusions </p>

<p>Most of the retention trials that we identified evaluated questionnaire response. There were few evaluations of ways to improve partic-
ipants returning to trial sites for trial follow-up. Monetary incentives and offers of monetary incentives increased postal and electronic 
questionnaire response. Some other strategies evaluated in single trials looked promising but need further evaluation. Application of 
the findings of this review would depend on trial setting, population, disease area, data collection and follow-up procedures. </p>

<p>Most trials follow people up to collect data through personal contact after they have been recruited. Some trials get data from other 
sources, such as routine collected data or disease registers. There are many ways to collect data from people in trials, and these include 
using letters, the internet, telephone calls, text messaging, face-to-face meetings or the return of medical test kits. Most trials have 
missing data, for example, because people are too busy to reply, are unable to attend a clinic, have moved or no longer want to participate. 
Sometimes data has not been recorded at study sites, or are not sent to the trial co-ordinating centre. Researchers call this 'loss to follow-
up', 'drop out' or 'attrition' and it can affect the trial's results. For example, if the people with the most or least severe symptoms do not 
return questionnaires or attend a follow-up visit, this will bias the findings of the trial. Many methods are used by researchers to keep 
people in trials. These encourage people to send back data by questionnaire, return to a clinic or hospital for trial-related tests, or be 
seen by a health or community care worker. </p>

<p>Study characteristics </p>

<p>This review identified methods that encouraged people to stay in trials. We searched scientific databases for randomised studies (where 
people are allocated to one of two or more possible treatments in a random manner) or quasi-randomised studies (where allocation is 
not really random, e.g. based on date of birth, order in which they attended clinic) that compared methods of increasing retention in 
trials. We included trials of participants from any age, gender, ethnic, cultural, language and geographic groups. </p>

<p>Key results </p>

<p>The methods that appeared to work were offering or giving a small amount of money for return of a completed questionnaire and 
enclosing a small amount of money with a questionnaire with the promise of a further small amount of money for return of a filled 
in questionnaire. The effect of other ways to keep people in trials is still not clear and more research is needed to see if these really do 
work. Such methods are shorter questionnaires, sending questionnaires by recorded delivery, using a trial design where people know 
which treatment they will receive, sending specially designed letters with a reply self addressed stamped envelope followed by a number 
of reminders, offering a donation to charity or entry into a prize draw, sending a reminder to the study site about participants to follow-
up, sending questionnaires close to the time the patient was last followed-up, managing peoples' follow-up, conducting follow-up by 
telephone and changing the order of questionnaire questions. </p>

<p>Quality of evidence </p>

<p>The methods that we identified were tested in trials run in many different disease areas and settings and, in some cases, were tested in 
only one trial. Therefore, more studies are needed to help decide whether our findings could be used in other research fields. </p>

<p>Description of the problem or issue </p>

<p>Randomised trials are the gold standard for evaluating the effec-
tiveness and efficacy of interventions. Non-response or loss to fol-
low-up within study groups in randomised trials can compromise 
study findings by reducing the power of a study to detect a true 
difference between the control and the intervention group. Dif-
ferential loss to follow-up may lead to bias through exaggerated 
effects in favour of one of the groups. This can affect the general-
isability and internal validity of the trial and the results (Fewtrell  2008; Schulz 2002). 
Missing data from loss to follow-up can be dealt with statistically 
by various methods including, for example, imputing values based 
on valid assumptions about the missing data to give a conserva-
tive estimate of the treatment effect. However, the risk of bias still 
remains when trials do not collect adequate data to give accurate 
estimates (Hollis 1999). Schulz and colleagues suggested that less 
than 5% loss to follow-up may lead to minimum bias, while 20% 
loss to follow-up can threaten trial validity, although the pattern 
of loss to follow-up by treatment may also be an important fac-
tor (Schulz 2002). Loss to follow-up from randomised trials can 
sometimes go unreported and using different, but plausible, as-
sumptions about outcomes for participants lost to follow-up can 
change the results of randomised trials. 
A number of trials have retrospectively examined the predictors 
of loss to follow-up in different disease areas (Arnow 2007; Snow  2007; Villarruel 2006). In a trial for the treatment of chronic major 
depression, Arnow examined the predictors of time to, and reason 
for, dropout of participants (Arnow 2007). Ethnic minorities and 
participants with comorbid anxiety were more likely to drop out. 
In a randomised trial of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) </p>

<p>prevention intervention for Latino youths, English speakers were 
more likely to attend follow-up (Villarruel 2006). Snow examined 
the predictors of clinic attendance and dropout at the 11-year 
follow-up of the Lung Health study (Snow 2007). Age, gender, 
number of cigarettes smoked per day, marital status and whether 
participant's children smoked were predictors of clinic attendance. 
These analyses showed that attendance for follow-up can be trial 
and disease specific. An awareness of these factors can help trialists 
decide which strategies to adopt to improve retention in their 
randomised trial. </p>

<p>Description of the methods being investigated </p>

<p>Strategies to improve trial retention include those designed to gen-
erate maximum data return or compliance to follow-up proce-
dures. These can include frequency and timing of follow-up visits 
(follow-up shortly after randomisation versus long-term follow-
up), nature of the outcome to be measured (survey based self re-
ported outcomes versus morbidity or mortality reporting), target 
of the intervention (participants versus providers versus trial sites), 
and type of intervention (incentives versus communication strate-
gies versus participant case management). </p>

<p>How these methods might work </p>

<p>These retention strategies are designed to motivate participants 
(Leathem 2009), or the trial site to continue participating in a trial 
once they have been recruited and randomised. Some strategies 
are designed to encourage participants to identify with the trial 
and to promote a sense of value and belonging, for example, using 
trial identity cards. Other strategies are designed to keep partic-
ipants engaged in the trial, for example, by sending participant </p>

<p>newsletters. To encourage a proactive approach to trial retention, 
strategies can be designed to target participants directly through 
letters, emails, telephone calls or to target them via the clinicians 
involved in participant follow-up, for example, through regular 
communication with trial sites. Strategies have been specifically 
developed to promote retention in areas of research where it is 
particularly challenging, such as mental health (Furimsky 2008; 
Loue 2008), weight loss ( Couper 2007; Goldberg 2005), rare 
diseases (McKinstry 2007), substance abuse (El Khorazaty 2007), 
research involving minority ethnic groups (Eakin 2007; Loftin 
2005; Villacorta 2007), and vulnerable groups such as older peo-
ple (Burns 2008) or people with HIV (Anastasi 2005). </p>

<p>Why it is important to do this review </p>

<p>As drop-out or incomplete data causes problems in the conduct, 
analysis and interpretation of randomised trials, it is important 
to identify retention strategies that minimise this loss as far as 
possible. 
Davis and colleagues conducted a review of community-based tri-
als published from 1990 to 1999 and described retention strate-
gies and retention outcomes for this area (Davis 2002). Robinson 
and colleagues conducted a systematic review of strategies for re-
taining study participants (Robinson 2007). While both reviews 
identified studies providing data on retention rates from primary 
studies and strategies used to promote retention, these were not 
evaluated quantitatively in either review. 
A systematic review of strategies to retain participants in popu-
lation-based cohort studies found that providing incentives was 
consistently associated with retention in these studies and that re-
sponse generally increased with increasing incentive value (Booker 
2011). Reminder letters, repeat questionnaires and reminder calls 
also increased response rates. Furthermore, the Edwards et al. 
Cochrane methodology review on methods to increase response 
rates to postal and electronic questionnaires found that including 
monetary incentives, keeping the questionnaire short and contact-
ing people before sending the questionnaire were ways to increase 
response rates (Edwards 2009). That review was not restricted 
to research exclusively within randomised trials and covered both 
healthcare and non-healthcare settings and it is difficult to know 
which of these strategies would be applicable to randomised trials 
in health care. Reasons for drop-out in cohort studies and surveys 
may differ from those in randomised trials. For example, in tri-
als, participants may be randomised to a study group that is not 
their preferred choice and factors around randomisation and the 
type of intervention mean that strategies increasing retention in 
cohort studies and surveys cannot necessarily be extrapolated to 
randomised trials. 
The challenges of boosting recruitment to randomised trials is of-
ten described alongside retention in the literature. Some similar 
strategies may be used in an attempt to both increase recruitment 
and improve retention, such as giving incentives together with ex-</p>

<p>tra information. Rendell et al. assessed the evidence for the effect 
of disincentives and incentives on the extent to which clinicians in-
vite eligible people to participate in randomised trials of healthcare 
interventions (Rendell 2007). No randomised trials of interven-
tions were identified and the authors concluded that some aspects 
of the conduct of the trial might affect a clinician's willingness to 
invite people to participate, for example, the way the clinician is 
invited to take part and the availability of support staff. In another 
Cochrane methodology review, Treweek et al. assessed strategies 
to improve recruitment to research studies (Treweek 2010), but 
recruitment to trials presents different challenges to participant 
engagement and follow-up. For example, strategies to market a 
trial and win over participants during the recruitment phase may 
be different to strategies to keep participants engaged in a trial 
(Francis 2007). 
Many untested strategies are used by researchers to try to improve 
retention in randomised trials. Therefore, because loss to follow-
up can compromise the validity of a trial's findings, delay results 
and, in some circumstances, increase the costs of the research, 
a systematic review is needed to assess the effect of strategies to 
improve retention in randomised trials. </p>

<p>Criteria for considering studies for this review </p>

<p>Types of studies </p>

<p>We included completed randomised trials that compared strategies 
to increase retention embedded in host randomised trials (hereafter 
referred to as retention trials). The retention trials were embedded 
in real trials (host trials) and not hypothetical trials. The retention 
trials included at least one randomised comparison of two or more 
strategies to improve retention, or compared one or more strategies 
with no strategy. In anticipation of few trials, we included retention 
trials if they were randomised or quasi-randomised (e.g. had used 
alternation, date of birth or case record number as a method of 
allocating participants) (Lefebvre 2008). 
Strategies to improve retention were designed for impact after par-
ticipants were recruited and randomised to either the intervention </p>

<p>or control group of the main and the retention trial. We included 
trials to increase response to postal and electronic questionnaire. 
We excluded trials to increase recruitment only. We excluded co-
hort studies with embedded randomised retention trials, which 
were the subject of a separate systematic review (Booker 2011). </p>

<p>Types of data </p>

<p>We included randomised and quasi-randomised retention trials 
within the context of a host randomised trial with participants 
from any age, gender, ethnic, cultural, language and geographic 
groups. We included unpublished and published participant re-
tention data from randomised trials addressing healthcare (includ-
ing all disciplines and disease areas) and non-healthcare (educa-
tion, social sciences) topics. We also included trials set in the com-
munity that were healthcare related. </p>

<p>Types of methods </p>

<p>We considered any strategy aimed at increasing retention, directed 
towards the clinician, researcher or participant. We included strate-
gies compared with each other or with usual study procedures. We 
also included trials with any combination of strategies to increase 
retention. Strategies could be participant or trial management fo-
cused and include any of the following: 
• strategies to motivate participants and clinicians (e.g. 
incentives or gifts); 
• strategies to improve communication with participants or 
trial sites (e.g. enhanced letters); 
• methodology strategies (e.g. shorter length of follow-up or 
variation in follow-up visit frequency); 
• strategies to improve social support for participant 
retention. </p>

<p>Types of outcome measures </p>

<p>Primary outcomes </p>

<p>We used retention (the proportion of participants retained) at 
the primary analysis point as defined in each individual retention 
trial as the primary outcome because it is easier to interpret than 
attrition/loss to follow-up (i.e. the proportion lost or not retained). 
In cases where the time point for measurement of the primary 
outcome was not predefined, we took the first time point reported 
for analysis. In most cases, this was final response. If retention at 
a number of time points was reported and no clear time point for 
the primary outcome for the retention trial was stated, we took 
data for the nearest time point to the intervention in the retention 
trial analyses. </p>

<p>Secondary outcomes </p>

<p>Retention of participants at secondary analysis points. </p>

<p>Search methods for identification of studies </p>

<p>We designed a search strategy to identify published and unpub-
lished randomised and quasi-randomised trials that assessed strate-
gies to improve retention in randomised trials in healthcare, ed-
ucation and social science settings. We searched bibliographic 
databases for published trials and trial registers for trials that had 
not been fully published, or were unpublished or ongoing. We 
applied no language restrictions. </p>

<p>Electronic searches </p>

<p>Each search comprised an established filter to identify randomised 
trials plus free-text terms and database subject headings relating to 
reducing loss to follow-up or increasing retention (Appendix 1). 
Electronic databases searched included: 
• the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL) (to May 2012); </p>

<p>• PreMEDLINE (to April 2010); 
• MEDLINE (1950 to May 2012) (Appendix 2), EMBASE 
(1980 to May 2012) (Appendix 3) and PsycINFO (1806 to May 
2012) (Appendix 4), searched using an Ovid platform; 
• Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, in The 
Cochrane Library May 2012); 
• CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health; 1981 to May 2012) (Appendix 5), using the 
EBSCOHost platform; 
• Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, 
Educational and Criminological Trials Register (C2-SPECTR 
http://geb9101.gse.upenn.edu/: searched May 2009 (website no 
longer accessible)) (Appendix 6); 
• Education Resource Information Centre (ERIC) 1966 to 
May 2009) (Appendix 7), using Dialog Datastar. </p>

<p>Searching other resources </p>

<p>We handsearched the reference lists of relevant publications and 
reviews to identify further trial reports (Horsley 2011) (Appendix 
8). We also searched the abstracts of Society for Clinical Trials 
(SCT) meetings from 1980 to 2012, the Current Controlled Tri-
als metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-
trials.com/mrct), the Cochrane Methodology Register (in The 
Cochrane Library to April 2012) and the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) trials platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We con-
ducted a survey of Clinical Trial Units in the UK to identify further 
eligible trials not identified through other sources and the review 
was presented at the Society for Clinical Trials 31st Conference in 
Baltimore, USA in May 2010 and advertised on the Conference </p>

<p>notice board with the aim of identifying potentially eligible trials 
from outside the UK. </p>

<p>Data collection and analysis </p>

<p>Selection of studies </p>

<p>One review author (VB) selected potentially eligible trials from the 
titles and abstracts retrieved by the searches, using a predesigned 
study eligibility screening form. We were over inclusive when 
screening, 0.7% (168/24,304) of records identified were sent for 
screening to a second review author (GR), which is 23% (168/ 
735) of all potentially eligible records identified. We obtained full-
text papers and two review authors (VB, GR) reviewed potentially 
eligible trials for inclusion. We contacted study authors for elec-
tronic copies of papers that we could not access through library 
sources. We were able to obtain copies of all the potentially eligible 
papers that we wanted to screen. We resolved disagreements by 
discussion with a third review author (SS). When necessary, we 
sought information from the original investigators for potentially 
eligible trials where we wished to clarify eligibility. </p>

<p>Data extraction and management </p>

<p>One review author (VB) extracted data from eligible retention 
trial and associated host trial papers and a second review author 
(JT) checked the entries. We reached consensus on any dispari-
ties by discussion with a third review author (SS). Data extracted 
for the host trial were aim, setting, disease area, comparators, pri-
mary outcome, sample size calculation, inclusion exclusion crite-
ria, sequence generation and allocation concealment, and num-
bers randomised to each group. For the embedded retention trial, 
we extracted data for onset in relation to the host trial, source of 
the sample, aim, primary outcome and type of follow-up. The 
retention strategy details included type, frequency and timing of 
administration method of randomisation, numbers randomised, 
included and retained at primary analysis, and data required for 
the risk of bias assessment. </p>

<p>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies </p>

<p>To assess the validity of each retention trial we judged them against 
the four domains of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 
2008a). To assess selection bias, we recorded how the allocation 
sequence was generated at study level and the methods used to 
conceal the allocation. We assessed performance bias by recording 
methods used to blind participants if considered appropriate to do 
so. For some interventions, participants could not be blinded to the 
intervention (e.g. where vouchers, cash or gifts were administered). 
However, in these cases, study personnel could be blinded to the </p>

<p>allocation if administration of the intervention was carried out by 
someone unaware of the allocation. 
As retention is the subject of our review, and retention of partic-
ipants is the primary outcome, attrition from the trials does not 
constitute a bias and has not been included in the 'Risk of bias' 
tables. We assessed each included retention trial for selective out-
come reporting by recording the primary outcome for the trial and 
the outcomes for which results were reported. A judgement was 
made about each trial for each risk of bias domain assessed. For 
completed host trials (within which retention trials were embed-
ded), we only assessed sequence generation and allocation con-
cealment, in order to ensure the host trial was randomised. </p>

<p>Measures of the effect of the methods </p>

<p>We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) for retention to determine the effect of strategies on this 
outcome. </p>

<p>Unit of analysis issues </p>

<p>For retention trials that randomised individuals and clusters, the 
unit of analysis was the participant. For cluster randomised trials 
that ignored clustering in the analysis, we inflated the standard 
errors (SE) to avoid overprecise estimates of effect as follows ( 
Higgins 2008b). 
1. We calculated the RR, 95% CI and SE based on 
participants in the usual way (i.e. ignoring clustering). 
2. This standard error was then inflated using the design effect 
to get an adjusted SE: adjusted SE = SE X 
√ 
design effect. With 
the design effect calculated as follows: design effect = 1 + (M -1) 
ICC where M = mean cluster size, ICC = the intracluster 
correlation coefficient. 
3. Where published ICCs were not available, we used the 
mean ICC from appropriate external estimates for Land 2007. 
This was the mean of estimates for the return of EuroQol 
questionnaires (ICC = 0.054) from a source recommended by 
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 
(Section 16.3.4) (Higgins 2008b) and www.abdn.ac.uk/hsru/ 
documents/iccs-web.xls (last accessed 27 September 2013). 
4. We entered the effect estimate and the new updated SE into 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Review Manager</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5</rs> using the generic inverse variance (RevMan 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2012</rs>). 
Where the number of participants randomised was not clearly 
stated in the included study report, we contacted the study authors 
for this information. </p>

<p>Dealing with missing data </p>

<p>We contacted study authors for data for the risk of bias assessment, 
numbers randomised to each group and numbers retained in each 
group at the primary endpoint. We described outcomes with in-
sufficient data qualitatively. For time-to-event outcomes, we used </p>

<p>6 
Strategies to improve retention in randomised trials (Review) 
Copyright © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. </p>

<p>the time point of the host study primary outcome, taking account 
of censoring if necessary and if the data were available. </p>

<p>Assessment of heterogeneity </p>

<p>We measured heterogeneity of the intervention effect using the 
Chi 2 statistic at a significance level of 0.10 and the I 2 statistic 
(Higgins 2003), and explored through subgroup analyses. </p>

<p>Assessment of reporting biases </p>

<p>We would have investigated reporting bias using tests for funnel 
plot asymmetry if sufficient data had been available (Egger 1997; 
Sterne 2008). </p>

<p>Data synthesis </p>

<p>If there was no substantial heterogeneity, we pooled RRs using 
the fixed-effect model. If heterogeneity was detected and could 
not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses, we used the 
random-effects model or did not pool results. 
For factorial trials (Sharp 2006a-h, Kenton 2007a-d), all main 
effects were included as separate trial comparisons if they ad-
dressed different categories of strategies. Where the main effects 
addressed two or more strategies within the same category (e.g. 
Bowen 2000abc), we combined the relevant intervention groups 
and compared them with the control group. We also compared 
each intervention group with the control group, as separate trial 
comparisons, in exploratory analyses. For one 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial 
trial (Renfroe 2002a-d), the numbers randomised for each group 
were not available at the time of analysis so comparison groups 
were collapsed as far as possible and then treated as separate trial 
comparisons in the appropriate analyses. For two three-armed tri-
als that compared two similar intervention groups with one con-
trol group, we combined the intervention groups and compared 
it with the control group for the main analyses (Bauer 2004ab, 
Khadjesari 2011 1abc). We also compared each intervention group 
as separate trial comparisons in exploratory analyses. 
These approaches allowed full exploration of the data and also 
avoided double counting and over-precise pooled estimates of ef-
fect in our main analyses. However, this also meant that there were 
occasionally a greater number of trial comparisons than trials. 
Computations for the absolute benefits of effective strategies on 
questionnaire response and trial retention were based on abso-
lute risk reductions derived from meta-analysis RRs (Cochrane 
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Section 12.5.4.2: 
Schünemann 2008). </p>

<p>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity </p>

<p>To explore the effect of different strategies on trial retention, we 
planned the following subgroup analyses by the type of strategy 
used in included retention trials. </p>

<p>• Whether the strategy was compared with usual follow-up or 
other strategies. 
• Whether in healthcare or non-healthcare settings. 
• Whether assessment of retention was immediate or longer 
term (e.g. if a response to a questionnaire was expected 
immediately or at later time points). 
• Whether the strategy was participant or management 
focused. </p>

<p>However, we identified such a diversity of retention trials and in-
terventions that these analyses were inappropriate or not possible. 
Therefore, different types of strategies were analysed separately and 
new subgroups were defined within these before we conducted the 
analyses. </p>

<p>(a) Incentives </p>

<p>We subgrouped retention trials or trial comparisons evaluating the 
addition of an incentive strategy versus none as follows for analysis. 
1. Monetary incentives given upfront, defined as money given 
to the trial participant prior to data collection in cheque, cash or 
voucher format. 
2. Non-monetary incentives, defined as gifts, for example, 
pens or certificates. 
3. Offers of monetary incentives after data collection, defined 
as a promise of the incentive after return of outcome data 
through attendance for scheduled follow-up or receipt of follow-
up questionnaires. 
4. Offers of non-monetary incentives defined as a promise of 
the non-monetary incentive after return of outcome data 
through attendance for scheduled follow-up or receipt of follow-
up questionnaires. 
We subgrouped retention trials or trial comparisons comparing 
different values of monetary incentives into: 
1. those offering incentives; 
2. those both giving and offering an incentive for any 
subsequent data (e.g. sending GBP5 with a questionnaire with 
an offer of GBP5 if the questionnaire is returned). 
We analysed retention trials evaluating the addition of a monetary 
incentive versus either an offer of a monetary incentive or follow-
up by telephone separately. </p>

<p>(b) Communication </p>

<p>We grouped retention trials or trial comparisons of the effect of 
different communication strategies into letter, post and reminder 
strategies for analysis as follows. 
1. Enhanced versus standard cover letter. 
2. Total design method versus standard postal communication 
strategy. 
3. Priority versus regular post. 
4. Additional reminders versus usual reminders to trial sites. </p>

<p>5. Additional reminders versus usual follow-up to trial 
participants. 
6. Early versus late administration of questionnaire (i.e. 
sending questionnaires two to three weeks after a follow-up visit 
versus one to four months after a follow-up visit). 
7. Recorded delivery versus telephone reminder. </p>

<p>(c) Questionnaire structure </p>

<p>We subgrouped trials of questionnaire strategies into length of 
questionnaire, clarity of meaning, order of questions and layout 
as follows. 
1. Short versus long questionnaire. 
2. Long and clear questionnaire versus short and condensed 
questionnaire. 
3. Medical condition questions first versus generic questions 
first. 
4. Relevance of questionnaires: alcohol versus mental health 
questionnaires. 
There were no subgroups for behavioural, case management and 
methodology retention trials. 
Our analyses focused on the primary endpoint of retention. We 
initially pooled retention trials within subgroups using the fixed-
effect model and quantified heterogeneity. We assessed whether 
these subgroups had a differential impact on retention using the 
test for interaction. We did not pool trials if results were inconsis-
tent or heterogeneity was excessive. </p>

<p>Sensitivity analysis </p>

<p>To assess the robustness of the results we planned sensitivity anal-
yses that excluded quasi-randomised retention trials. </p>

<p>R E S U L T S </p>

<p>Description of studies </p>

<p>The studies are described in the Characteristics of included 
studies, Characteristics of studies awaiting classification, and 
Characteristics of excluded studies tables. </p>

<p>Results of the search </p>

<p>We identified 24,304 abstracts, titles and other records from 
database searches to May 2012, handsearches of reviews, lists of 
references in included papers, SCT conference abstracts (to 2012), 
personal contact with trialists, and the survey of UK Clinical Trials 
Units (Figure 1). We screened 735 full-text papers, reports and 
manuscripts for eligible studies. Of 68 potentially eligible studies, 
we found 30 to be subsequently ineligible. This left 38 retention 
trials for inclusion in the review. The retention trials were embed-
ded in real trials (host trials). We identified 11retention trials from 
CENTRAL, MEDLINE and CINAHL; 14 from handsearching 
reviews, conference abstracts, and references lists of eligible papers; 
and 13 through personal communications or correspondence with 
clinical trials units. We evaluated six broad types of strategy to im-
prove retention in randomised trials. Most strategies were targeted 
at increasing questionnaire response. The strategies used for this 
were incentives, communication, methodology and questionnaire 
design strategies. There was minimal evidence for the use of be-
havioural and case management strategies to improve retention. </p>

<p>Included studies </p>

<p>Of the 38 eligible retention trials, 28 were published in full, one 
as an abstract (Kenton 2007a-d), and one as part of a PhD thesis 
(Nakash 2007). Four retention trial publications contained two 
trials each (Khadjesari 2011; McCambridge 2011; McColl 2003; 
Severi 2011). Eight retention trials are unpublished as of June 
2013 (Bailey 1; Bailey 2; Edwards 2001; Land 2007; Letley 2000; 
MacLennan; Marson 2007; Svoboda 2001). </p>

<p>Host trials </p>

<p>Twenty-two host trials included a single retention trial (AVID 
investigators 1997; Boyd 2002; Chaffin 2009; Cooke 2009; Cox 
2008; Gail 1992; Dennis 2009; Hughes 1984; International 
Stroke Trial Group 1997; Kenyon 2001; Lamb 2007; Leigh Brown 
2001; Marson 2007 (2); Omenn 2006; Porterhouse 2005; Rothert 
2006; Tai 1999; Tilbrook 2011; TOMBOLA 2009a; TOMBOLA 
2009b; UK BEAM 2004). Two host trials from this group were 
unpublished (for the retention trials by Ashby 2011 and Land 
2007). 
The other host trials included multiple retention trials (one un-
published for the retention trials by Bailey 1 and Bailey 2). Two 
retention trials (Ford 2006; Subar 2001) were embedded in the 
US-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian (PLCO) screen-
ing trial of Prorok 2000; two (Avenell 2004; MacLennan) in 
the RECORD fracture prevention trial (RECORD 2007); two 
(Edwards 2001; Svoboda 2001) in the CRASH trial (CRASH Trial 
collaborators 2004); four (Khadjesari 2011 1abc; Khadjesari 2011 
2; McCambridge 2011 1; McCambridge 2011 2) in the Down 
your Drink Trial (Murray 2007); two (Bailey 1; Bailey 2) in a 
feasibility study for the Sex unzipped website (unpublished); two 
(Severi 2011 1; Severi 2011 2) in the Text to Stop smoking cessa-
tion trial (Free 2011); and two (McColl 2003 1; McColl 2003 2) 
in the COGENT trial (Eccles 2002). </p>

<p>Participants and settings </p>

<p>Included retention trials were conducted in a broad spectrum 
of clinical conditions and geographical settings (see Appendix  9). Eight included retention trials were embedded in trials 
for the treatment of alcohol and smoking dependency (Bauer 
2004ab; Hughes 1989; Khadjesari 2011 1abc; Khadjesari 2011 
2; McCambridge 2011 1; McCambridge 2011 2; Severi 2011 1; 
Severi 2011 2), and four in trials investigating treatments for in-
juries (Edwards 2001; Gates 2009; Nakash 2007; Svoboda 2001). 
Six retention trials were set in treatment trials for cancer, cardiovas-
cular disease, epilepsy and back pain (Dorman 1997; Land 2007; 
Letley 2000; Man 2011; Marson 2007; Renfroe 2002a-d), and </p>

<p>four were embedded in screening trials for cancer, postnatal de-
pression, and elderly diseases (Ford 2006; Kenton 2007a-d; Sharp 
2006a-h; Subar 2001). Seven retention trials were embedded in 
prevention trials, which included two cancer prevention trials for 
lung and breast cancer (Bowen 2000abc; Sutherland 1996), one 
migraine prevention trial (Ashby 2011), and three fracture pre-
vention trials (Avenell 2004; Cockayne 2005; MacLennan). Four 
retention trials were conducted in clinical management trials for 
orthopaedics, asthma, diabetes and angina (Leigh Brown 1997; 
McColl 2003 1; McColl 2003 2; Tai 1997). Six retention tri-
als were conducted in other areas: exercise (Cox 2008), parent-
ing (Chaffin 2009), weight management (Couper 2007), neonatal 
medicine (Kenyon 2005), and sexual health promotion (Bailey 1; 
Bailey 2). 
Twenty-five retention trials were UK based, nine were USA based 
and two were set in Canada. The remainder were set in Czech 
Republic and Australia (see Characteristics of included studies 
table). 
Retention trials were embedded in host trials that recruited partic-
ipants from different settings. Five trials recruited participants di-
rectly from the community. Sixteen trials were conducted through 
secondary care facilities. One trial recruited participants through a 
combination of state workers compensation programmes, occupa-
tional and physician clinic, a surveillance programme and union 
records. Six UK trials recruited solely through general practitioner 
(GP) practices and two used a combination of recruitment through 
GP practices and the media. Seven trials recruited participants via 
the Internet, six of these were UK based and the other was US 
based. For one US-based smoking cessation trial, it was unclear 
how participants were recruited (see Characteristics of included 
studies table). </p>

<p>Design of included retention trials </p>

<p>One trial was hosted in a clustered randomised trial and used 
this design to evaluate a strategy to improve retention (Land 
2007). Four retention trials used different factorial designs (Bowen 
2000abc; Kenton 2007a-d; Renfroe 2002a-d; Sharp 2006a-h). 
There was also one three-armed trial (Bauer 2004ab), and three 
four-armed trials (Khadjesari 2011 1abc; McCambridge 2011 1; 
McCambridge 2011 2). 
Five trials used quasi-randomisation to allocate participants ( 
Bowen 2000abc; Ford 2006; Gates 2009; McColl 2003 1; McColl 
2003 2). Two used participant identification numbers (Ford 2006; 
Gates 2009), and two allocated the first half of a simple random 
sample of participants to receive one version of a questionnaire, 
while the remaining half was allocated to a second version (McColl 
2003 1; McColl 2003 2). One retention trial used day of clinic 
visit to allocate participants (Bowen 2000abc). </p>

<p>

<p>All trials targeted individual trial participants, except one that tar-
geted trial sites (Land 2007). 
We recorded the timing of randomisation in the host trial ver-
sus the timing of randomisation in the retention trial. Four tri-
als commenced during a randomised pilot study for the host 
trial (Khadjesari 2011 1abc; Letley 2000; McCambridge 2011 1; 
Sutherland 1996). One study started before the host trial (Chaffin 
2009). Twenty-nine trials commenced during follow-up for the 
host trial (Ashby 2011; Avenell 2004; Bailey 1; Bailey 2; Bowen 
2000abc; Cockayne 2005; Couper 2007; Cox 2008; Dorman 
1997; Edwards 2001; Ford 2006; Gates 2009; Khadjesari 2011 2; 
Land 2007; Leigh Brown 1997; MacLennan; Man 2011; Marson 
2007; McCambridge 2011 2; McColl 2003 1; McColl 2003 2; 
Nakash 2007; Renfroe 2002a-d; Severi 2011 1; Severi 2011 2; 
Sharp 2006a-h; Subar 2001; Svoboda 2001; Tai 1997). For one 
trial, it was unclear when the retention trial started in relation 
to the host trial (Kenton 2007a-d). Three retention trials started 
after the host trial had finished (Bauer 2004ab; Hughes 1989; 
Kenyon 2005): Kenyon 2005 followed-up seven-year-old children 
of mothers enrolled in the ORACLE trial (Kenyon 2001), Bauer 
2004ab followed up participants in the COMMIT smoking cessa-
tion trial (Gail 1992), eight years after the original trial was com-
pleted and Hughes 1989 followed up participants in a smoking 
cessation trial six months after that study finished (Hughes 1984). </p>

<p>Strategies to improve retention </p>

<p>Retention in trials and response to questionnaires were the out-
comes measured for all included trials. The included trials evalu-
ated six different types of strategies to improve response or reten-
tion. Incentives, communication strategies, variation in question-
naire design, methodology strategies, and combinations of com-
munication and incentive strategies evaluated improving response 
to postal and electronic questionnaires. Behavioural strategies, case 
management and some non-monetary incentives were used to en-
courage participants to return to trial sites for follow-up visits. 
Each type of strategy is described separately below. </p>

<p>Outcome measures in the included trials </p>

<p>Thirty-four retention trials measured response to questionnaires. 
Among these, the questionnaires were by post in 26 trials, elec-
tronically in four and one was done by interview. For another three 
retention trials, response was return of biomedical kits or biomedi-
cal kits plus a questionnaire (see Characteristics of included studies 
table). 
Four included trials measured the number of participants remain-
ing in the trial (Bowen 2000abc; Chaffin 2009; Cox 2008; Ford 
2006) 
Ten included trials specified that their primary outcome was ques-
tionnaire response at a particular time point: McCambridge 2011 
1 measured response at one and three months, McCambridge </p>

<p>2011 2 measured response at three and 12 months, and Khadjesari 
2011 1abc and Khadjesari 2011 2 measured response within 40 
days of the first reminder. For Severi 2011 1, the primary out-
come was completed follow-up at 30 weeks from randomisation, 
Severi 2011 2 used return of specimens one month after a tele-
phone call, Avenell 2004 used retention at one year measured by 
questionnaire return but also reported retention at four and eight 
months. Cockayne 2005 and Sharp 2006a-h had final follow-up 
questionnaire response at any time as their primary outcome. 
Two included trials reported questionnaire response at one time 
point only but without specifying that this was the primary out-
come for the trial (Edwards 2001; Svoboda 2001). These trials 
measured response at three months from the questionnaire being 
sent. One trial reported trial retention at one time point only (three 
years) but without specifying that this was the primary outcome 
for the trial (Ford 2006). This was measured as completing the 
next cancer screening in a cancer screening trial. In each of these 
three trials, we used these data for analyses. 
Two trials recorded questionnaire response at two time points 
without stating which was the primary outcome (Dorman 1997; 
Gates 2009). One trial recorded retention at two time points with-
out stating which was the primary outcome (Cox 2008). We used 
data for response/retention after the first contact with respondents 
as the primary outcome for analyses. One trial reported response 
at three time points (4 weeks, 12 weeks and 9 months), which 
were all stated as the primary outcome (Nakash 2007). We used 
the data for week four in our main analysis. 
Five trials reported data in survival curves. For these, we used the 
final analysis point (Ashby 2011; Bowen 2000abc; Chaffin 2009; 
Land 2007; Sutherland 1996). Authors confirmed data when it 
had been extracted. Fifteen trials reported the number of ques-
tionnaires returned with no time point specified (Bauer 2004ab; 
Couper 2007; Hughes 1989; Kenton 2007a-d; Kenyon 2005; 
Leigh Brown 1997; Letley 2000; MacLennan; Man 2011; Marson 
2007; McColl 2003 1; McColl 2003 2; Renfroe 2002a-d; Subar 
2001; Tai 1997). </p>

<p>Addition of incentive versus none </p>

<p>There were 14 retention trials of incentives and 19 trial compar-
isons (Table 1). Thirteen trials were aimed at improving question-
naire response in trials and one trial was aimed at improving re-
turn for follow-up at trial site (Bowen 2000abc). The different in-
centive strategies aimed at improving questionnaire response were 
vouchers, cash, a charity donation, entry to prize draws, cheques, 
a certificate of appreciation and offers of study results. Incentive 
strategies aimed at improving retention were: certificates of appre-
ciation and lapel pins. The value of incentives used in UK evalu-
ations ranged from GBP5 to GBP20 and were in cash, cheque or 
voucher format. The value of incentives used in US-based studies 
was USD2 to USD10. For offers of entries into prize draws, the 
values were higher, ranging from GBP25 to GBP250 for UK prize </p>

<p>11

<p>draws and USD50 for US-based prize draws. One trial evaluated 
giving a monetary incentive with a promise of a further incentive 
for return of trial data (Bailey 2). </p>

<p>Communication strategies </p>

<p>There were 14 retention trials of communication strategies to im-
prove response to postal questionnaires or return of biomedical test 
kits, or both, in randomised trials. There were 20 trial comparisons 
(Table 2). Strategies evaluated were: enhanced letters, additional 
reminders to participants, priority mailing of questionnaires, time 
of questionnaire administration, telephone contact and reminders 
to trial sites of upcoming assessments. One trial used a combina-
tion of postal communication strategies known as the total design 
method (TDM) (Sutherland 1996). This included sending let-
ters in a white envelope with a hospital logo and commemorative 
stamp, a hand-signed letter on headed notepaper, with a reply self 
addressed stamped envelope, enclosing the contents. Follow-up 
was with a postcard sent after seven days followed by two reminder 
letters. This was compared with a customary method for postal 
follow-up. One trial evaluated the addition of an electronic SMS 
(short message service) text reminder on the day participants were 
due to receive their postal questionnaire (Man 2011). 
Five trials evaluated a combination of communication strate-
gies and incentives to improve retention from randomised tri-
als (Couper 2007; Kenton 2007a-d; Renfroe 2002a-d; Sharp 
2006a-h). The communication strategies were; first-and sec-
ond-class outward post (Kenton 2007a-d; Renfroe 2002b; Sharp 
2006a-h), stamped and business reply envelopes (Sharp 2006a-h), 
letters signed by different study personnel (Renfroe 2002c), letters 
posted at different times (Renfroe 2002d), text messages (Man 
2011; Severi 2011 1), and a telephone survey (Couper 2007). </p>

<p>Questionnaire format </p>

<p>The effect of a change in questionnaire format on response to 
randomised trial questionnaires was evaluated in eight trials with 
10 comparisons (Table 3). Formats evaluated were question-
naire length: short versus long (Dorman 1997; Edwards 2001; 
McCambridge 2011 1b; McCambridge 2011 2b; Svoboda 2001), 
long and clear versus short and condensed (Subar 2001), and the 
order of questions (Letley 2000; McColl 2003 1; McColl 2003 
2). 
Two further included trials evaluated the effect of the rele-
vance of a questionnaire on response (McCambridge 2011 1a; 
McCambridge 2011 2a). Relevance was defined as assessing alco-
hol problems rather than mental health in the context of an In-
ternet-based intervention for hazardous drinkers (McCambridge 
2011 1; McCambridge 2011 2). </p>

<p>Behavioural strategies </p>

<p>There were two trials of behavioural strategies used for retention in 
randomised trials (Chaffin 2009; Cox 2008). Cox 2008 compared 
motivational workshops versus information sheets. Chaffin 2009 
compared self motivation orientation versus standard information 
in the context of a parenting programme. In this case, the retention 
trial was run prior to the host trial with the intention of improving 
retention in the subsequent parenting programme evaluation trial. 
The analysis was based on the number eligible for inclusion in 
the primary analyses for the subsequent parenting programme 
because we do not know the allocation of those who dropped 
out between first and second randomisations. Complete time-to-
event data were not available for Chaffin 2009, but, as only two 
participants were censored in the analysis, this is unlikely to have 
biased the results. </p>

<p>Case management </p>

<p>One retention trial evaluated the effect of intensive case manage-
ment procedures on retention of African American male partici-
pants in a cancer screening trial (Ford 2006). </p>

<p>Methodology strategies </p>

<p>One included trial used a trial design where people knew which 
treatment they received. The trial compared questionnaire re-
sponse in an open versus blind trial (Avenell 2004). </p>

<p>Studies excluded from analyses </p>

<p>Two eligible trials could not be included in the analysis (Leigh 
Brown 1997; Letley 2000). Host trial participants in the reten-
tion trial by Leigh Brown 1997 were divided into two groups; one 
randomised, the other determined by preference of the referring 
primary care practitioner. The author confirmed that participants 
in the retention trial were from both randomised and non-ran-
domised groups of the host trial and that these could not be sep-
arated. 
One recently completed, unpublished trial that is not included 
in the review examined the effect of newsletters on retention ( 
Mitchell). This trial will be included in the review update. </p>

<p>Excluded studies </p>

<p>See Characteristics of excluded studies table. 
We excluded trials because they were either part of a non-ran-
domised host study, or they were not a randomised retention trial, 
or the primary outcome was type of data item missingness. Other 
excluded trials were aimed at increasing treatment compliance 
or baseline questionnaire response. We contacted investigators to 
confirm aspects of eligibility. </p>

<p>Risk of bias in included studies </p>

<p>See Characteristics of included studies. </p>

<p>Allocation </p>

<p>All included retention trials reported that participants were ran-
domly allocated to groups for comparison. Twenty-four included 
trials described adequate sequence generation by a computerised 
random number generator, block randomisation or use of a ta-
ble of random numbers table (Avenell 2004; Bailey 1; Bailey 
2; Bowen 2000abc; Chaffin 2009; Cockayne 2005; Cox 2008; 
Hughes 1989; Kenyon 2005; Khadjesari 2011 1abc; Khadjesari 
2011 2; Land 2007; Leigh Brown 1997; Letley 2000; MacLennan; 
Man 2011; Marson 2007; McCambridge 2011 1; McCambridge 
2011 2; Nakash 2007; Renfroe 2002a-d; Severi 2011 1; Severi 
2011 2; Sutherland 1996). There was insufficient information 
about the sequence generation for 10 included trials, these were all 
described as randomised in the retention trial publications (Ashby 
2011; Bauer 2004ab; Couper 2007; Dorman 1997; Edwards 
2001; Kenton 2007a-d; Sharp 2006a-h; Subar 2001; Svoboda 
2001; Tai 1997). Five included trials used quasi-randomisation 
to allocate participants (Bowen 2000abc; Ford 2006; Gates 2009; 
McColl 2003 1; McColl 2003 2). 
Several methods were used to avoid foreseen allocation of par-
ticipants; sequence generation by a trial statistician and imple-
mented by a trial manager; sequence generation by an indepen-
dent researcher, a central randomisation service, or by a nurse us-
ing a preprogrammed computer; or allocation by sealed envelopes 
or sequentially numbered packs. Fifteen trials reported both ad-
equate sequence generation and allocation concealment (Avenell 
2004; Bailey 1; Bailey 2; Cockayne 2005; Cox 2008; Hughes 
1989; Kenyon 2005; Khadjesari 2011 1abc; Khadjesari 2011 2; 
Letley 2000; MacLennan; Man 2011; McCambridge 2011 1; 
McCambridge 2011 2; Nakash 2007). </p>

<p>Blinding </p>

<p>Blinding of participants was generally not possible in included 
trials. For example, it is not possible to blind participants to 
the following strategies to increase trial retention or response to 
questionnaires: incentive or offer of incentive, behavioural (Cox 
2008), or case management strategies (Ford 2006), different types 
of communication strategies, or questionnaire format strategies. 
In a number of trials, authors mentioned that participants were 
aware of the intervention they were getting but were unaware that 
this was being evaluated (Bowen 2000abc; Chaffin 2009; Kenton 
2007a-d; Kenyon 2005; Leigh Brown 1997; MacLennan; Marson 
2007; McColl 2003 1; McColl 2003 2). For other trials, blinding 
of participants or study personnel to the outcome or intervention 
was not reported. For one trial, a judgement about blinding was 
not applicable because the study evaluated the effect of blind ver-
sus open trials on retention (Avenell 2004). </p>

<p>Incomplete outcome data </p>

<p>The primary outcome measure for this review was retention, and 
this was well reported. We contacted authors for clarification of any 
exclusions after randomisation if this was unclear from retention 
trial reports. </p>

<p>Selective reporting </p>

<p>Although retention trial protocols were not available for included 
trials, the included published and unpublished papers reported all 
expected outcomes for retention. </p>

<p>Other potential sources of bias </p>

<p>There were few other potential sources of bias identified from re-
ports of included retention trials. For the behavioural trial by Cox 
2008, the authors identified that the "walk and swim sessions were 
not separated according to the behavioural intervention. Partic-
ipants were asked not to discuss written materials in the practi-
cal sessions". Therefore, potential contamination between study 
groups could have led to biased results. </p>

<p>Effect of methods </p>

<p>1. Incentive strategies </p>

<p>There were 14 trials of incentives giving 19 trial comparisons with 
16,253 participants. There was considerable heterogeneity across 
incentive subgroups (P value &lt; 0.00001) (Analysis 1.1), so we 
decided not to pool the results for incentives. </p>

<p>Addition of incentive </p>

<p>The three trials (3166 participants) that evaluated the effect of giv-
ing monetary incentives to participants showed that the addition 
of monetary incentives was more effective than no incentive at in-
creasing response to postal questionnaires (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 
to 1.28, P value &lt; 0.0001) (Analysis 1.1). A sensitivity analysis 
excluding the quasi-randomised trial by Gates 2009 still showed 
that the addition of a monetary incentive remained more effec-
tive than none (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.55, P value = 0.002) 
(Analysis 2.1). 
Based on two Internet-based trials (3613 participants), an offer of 
a monetary incentive promoted greater return of electronic ques-
tionnaires than no offer (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38, P value &lt; 
0.00001; heterogeneity P value = 0.14) (Analysis 1.1). However, a 
single trial comparison suggested that an offer of a monetary do-
nation to charity did not increase response to electronic question-
naires (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.32; P value = 0.90) (Analysis 
1.1). </p>

Strategies to improve retention in randomised trials (Review) 
Copyright © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. </p>

<p>Based on six trials (6322 participants), there was no clear evidence 
that the addition of non-monetary incentives improved question-
naire response (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02, P value = 0.91), 
but there was some heterogeneity (P value = 0.02) (Analysis 1.1). 
A sensitivity analysis excluding the quasi-randomised trial (Bowen 
2000abc) showed a similar effect (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08, 
P value = 0.99) (Analysis 2.1) and heterogeneity (P value = 0.01). 
Two trials (1138 participants) evaluating offers of non-monetary 
incentives suggest that an offer of a non-monetary incentive is 
neither more nor less effective than no offer (RR 0.99; 95% CI 
0.95 to 1.03, P value = 0.60) at improving questionnaire response 
(Analysis 1.1). 
In exploratory analyses, the different incentive arms that were com-
bined for the main analysis did not appear to show differential 
effects (Analysis 3.1). </p>

<p>Addition of monetary incentive to both study arms </p>

<p>Two trials (902 participants) show that higher value incentives are 
better at increasing response to postal questionnaires than lower 
value incentives (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22, P value = 0.005) 
irrespective of how they are given (Analysis 5.1). </p>

<p>Addition of monetary incentive versus offer of a monetary 
incentive </p>

<p>Two trials (297 participants) provided no evidence that giving a 
monetary incentive is better than an offer of entry into a prize 
draw for improving response to postal questionnaires (RR 1.04; 
95% CI 0.91 to 1.19, P value = 0.56) Analysis 6.1. </p>

<p>Addition of an offer of entry into a prize draw versus none </p>

<p>We excluded one trial from the analysis (Leigh Brown 1997). The 
results showed higher responses in the group offered entry into a 
prize draw compared with the group not offered entry into the 
draw (70.5% versus 65.8%). </p>

<p>2. Communication strategies </p>

<p>There were 14 trials of communication strategies and 20 compar-
isons with 9822 participants. </p>

<p>Addition of telephone survey versus monetary incentive plus 
questionnaire </p>

<p>One trial (700 participants) showed no clear evidence that a tele-
phone survey was either more or less effective than a monetary 
incentive and a questionnaire for improving response (RR 1.08; 
95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, P value = 0.27) (Analysis 4.1). </p>

<p>Enhanced versus standard letters </p>

<p>Results from two trials (2479 participants) showed that an en-
hanced letter was neither more nor less effective than a standard 
letter for increasing response to trial postal questionnaires (RR 
1.01; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05, P value = 0.70) (Analysis 7.1). </p>

<p>Total design method versus customary method </p>

<p>Although based on a single trial (226 participants) the TDM pack-
age was more effective than a customary postal communication 
method at increasing questionnaire return (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.22 
to 1.67, P value &lt; 0.0001) (Analysis 8.1). </p>

<p>Priority versus regular post </p>

<p>Based on the relevant arms of seven trials (1888 participants), there 
was no clear evidence that priority post was either more or less 
effective than regular post at increasing trial questionnaire return 
(RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09, P value = 0.55) (Analysis 9.1). </p>

<p>Additional reminder versus usual follow-up practices </p>

<p>Six trials (3401 participants) evaluated the effect of different ad-
ditional types of reminders to participants on questionnaire re-
sponse. There was no evidence that a reminder was either more 
or less effective than no reminder at improving trial questionnaire 
response (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06, P value = 0.13) (Analysis 
10.1). </p>

<p>Additional reminder to trial site versus usual reminder </p>

<p>Based on one cluster randomised trial (272 participants), a 
monthly reminder to trial sites of upcoming assessment was nei-
ther more nor less effective than the usual follow-up (RR 0.96; 
95% CI 0.83 to 1.11, P value = 0.57) (Analysis 11.1). </p>

<p>Early versus late questionnaire administration </p>

<p>Based on one trial (664 participants), there was no clear evidence 
that sending questionnaires early either increased or decreased re-
sponse (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.26, P value = 0.19 (Analysis 
12.1). </p>

<p>Recorded delivery versus telephone reminder </p>

<p>One small trial (192 participants) found that recorded delivery 
was more effective than a telephone reminder (RR 2.08; 95% CI 
1.11 to 3.87; P value = 0.02) (Analysis 13.1). </p>

<p>3. New questionnaire strategies </p>

<p>New versus standard questionnaire </p>

<p>Eight trials with 10 comparisons (21,505 participants) evaluated 
the effect of a new questionnaire format on questionnaire response. 
Although there was some heterogeneity between the questionnaire 
subgroups (P value = 0.11) (Analysis 14.1), it did not seem rea-
sonable to pool the results based on such different interventions. 
Five trials (7277 participants) compared the effect of short ques-
tionnaires versus long on postal questionnaire response. There was 
only a suggestion that short questionnaires may be better (RR 
1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P value = 0.07) (Analysis 14.1). 
Based on one trial (900 participants; Subar 2001), there is no 
evidence that long and clear questionnaires were either more or 
less effective than shorter condensed questionnaires for increasing 
trial questionnaire response (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07, P 
value = 0.86) (Analysis 14.1). 
Two trials (9435 participants; McColl 2003 1; McColl 2003 2) 
found no evidence that placing disease/condition questions before 
generic questions is either a more or less effective strategy than 
a generic questions before disease/condition questions strategy at 
increasing trial questionnaire response (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.97 to 
1.02, P value = 0.75) (Analysis 14.1). It should be noted that these 
were quasi-randomised trials (Analysis 15.1). 
One trial in this category was not included in the analysis by Letley 
2000, outcome data were not available for each study arm when 
this review was submitted and the overall response rate for this 
trial was 87%. 
In the context of research on reducing alcohol consumption, there 
was also evidence that more relevant questionnaires (i.e. those 
relating to alcohol use) increased response rates (RR 1.07; 95% 
CI 1.01 to 1.14, P value = 0.03). </p>

<p>4. Behavioural/motivational strategies </p>

<p>Two community-based trials (273 participants; Chaffin 2009; 
Cox 2008) showed no evidence that the behavioural/motivational 
strategies used are either more or less effective than standard in-
formation for retaining trial participants (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.93 
to 1.24, P value = 0.31) (Analysis 16.1). </p>

<p>5. Case management </p>

<p>One trial (703 participants; Ford 2006) evaluated the effect of 
intensive case management procedures on retention. There is no 
evidence that intensive case management was either more or less 
effective than usual follow-up in the population examined (RR 
1.00; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.04, P value = 0.99) (Analysis 17.1). </p>

<p>6. Methodology strategies </p>

<p>One fracture prevention trial (538 participants; Avenell 2004) 
evaluated the effect of participants knowing their treatment al-
location (open trial) compared with participants blind/unaware 
of their allocation on questionnaire response. Using a trial design 
where people know which treatment they will receive led to higher 
questionnaire response rates (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63, P 
value = 0.0003) (Analysis 18.1). </p>

<p>Reporting bias </p>

<p>Although we planned to investigate potential reporting bias, there 
were too few studies in most strategies to allow formal testing. 
However, we were able to obtain considerable data from unpub-
lished trials and those published with limited information, reduc-
ing the risk of such biases. </p>

<p>Absolute benefits of strategies to improve retention </p>

<p>The absolute benefits of effective strategies on questionnaire re-
sponse are illustrated in Table 4. The baseline response rates were 
broadly typical of the response rates seen in trials. The number of 
questionnaires returned were based on the assumed control arm 
risk. 
Based on a 40% baseline response rate for postal questionnaires, 
the addition of a monetary incentive was estimated to increase 
response by 92 questionnaires per 1000 sent (95% CI 50 to 131). 
With the addition of an offer of a monetary incentive in an Inter-
net-based trial, based on a baseline response rate of 30%, trialists 
could expect an increase of 140 questionnaires per 1000 (95% CI 
86 to 193). 
For trials hoping to increase the return of postal questionnaires 
with chlamydia test kits, the number of kits returned was estimated 
to increase by 33 per 1000 sent when GBP20 was offered as an 
incentive, rather than GBP10 (95% CI 11 to 54). </p>

<p>D I S C U S S I O N </p>

<p>Summary of main results </p>

<p>Thirty-eight randomised retention trials were included in this re-
view, evaluating six broad types of strategies to increase question-
naire response and retention in randomised trials. In 34 trials, 
strategies for increasing response to questionnaires were: incen-
tives, communication strategies, new questionnaire format and 
methodological interventions. Four trials evaluated strategies to 
improve retention, these were: participant case management, be-
havioural and non-monetary incentive strategies. Trials were con-
ducted across a spectrum of disease areas, countries, healthcare and 
community settings. </p>

<p> 
Strategies to improve retention in randomised trials (Review)

<p>Strategies with the clearest impact on questionnaire response were: 
addition of monetary incentives compared with no incentive for 
return of postal questionnaires, addition of an offer of a mone-
tary incentive when compared with none for return of electronic 
questionnaires, and an offer of GBP20 vouchers when compared 
with GBP10 for return of postal questionnaires and biomedical 
test kits. The evidence was less clear about whether shorter ques-
tionnaires rather than longer questionnaires increased response. 
The evidence was also less clear whether in the context of research 
on reducing alcohol consumption more relevant questionnaires 
increased response. 
The addition of a non-monetary incentive, an offer of a non-mon-
etary incentive compared with no incentive or, 'enhanced' letters, 
letters delivered by priority post, or additional reminders com-
pared with standard communication strategies did not increase or 
decrease trial questionnaire response. Questionnaire structure also 
did not seem to increase response. 
Although each was based on the results of a single trial, recorded 
delivery (proof of posting and an electronic copy of the signa-
ture available online) of questionnaires seemed more effective than 
telephone reminders, and a 'package' of postal communication 
strategies with reminder letters appeared better than standard pro-
cedures. A trial design where participants knew which treatment 
they were to receive also appeared more effective than a trial de-
sign where they were unaware of the treatment they were about to 
receive for return of questionnaires in a fracture prevention trial. 
Further evaluation of these strategies may be needed. Posting ques-
tionnaires early, questionnaire order, offers of charity donations or 
sending reminders to trial sites did not improve response. 
Many trial outcome measures were collected using questionnaires, 
therefore, if response rates can be increased, retention will also 
be improved. No strategy had a clear impact on increasing the 
number of participants returning to trial sites for follow-up visits. </p>

<p>Overall completeness and applicability of 
evidence </p>

<p>The addition of a GBP5 voucher to usual follow-up procedures 
was effective for return of postal questionnaires in trials conducted 
between 2005 and 2009. The more recent unpublished studies by 
Bailey 1 Bailey 2 found GBP20 vouchers were more effective than 
GBP10 vouchers for return of postal questionnaires. Splitting the 
monetary incentive into money given before and after receipt of 
data could be more effective as a strategy to increase questionnaire 
follow-up with different population groups and in different trial 
settings where questionnaire response is low (e.g. with hard to reach 
groups that may include young male healthy adults, teenagers or 
residents in areas of high economic deprivation). This could be a 
cost-effective strategy because if questionnaires are not returned 
then money is saved. The value of the monetary incentive should 
not be so high as to be perceived as payment for data but more as an 
appreciation for efforts made by participants. Offering monetary </p>

<p>incentives may increase the number of questionnaires returned per 
1000 participants by at least as much as giving monetary incentives 
and giving higher valued monetary incentives, but has only been 
tested in online questionnaires. Offers of monetary incentives were 
also an effective strategy in the context of an online electronic 
questionnaire. These could be less costly to increase retention than 
the addition of a monetary incentive as only those who return 
the data are reimbursed. This would need further evaluation as 
the results were based on two Internet-based trials. It would be 
beneficial for trialists to know which is more effective: an offer of 
a monetary incentive or an upfront monetary incentive. We did 
not find any trials that made this direct comparison. 
Shorter postal questionnaires have wide applicability to trials and 
could be considered as a useful strategy to increase trial question-
naire response in online Internet-based trials but there is only a 
suggestion that these are effective. 
Several strategies showed no clear effect. The addition of non-
monetary incentives in the form of pens, lapel pins and certificates 
of appreciation, or offers of non-monetary incentives through of-
fering study results did not increase response or retention. A pos-
sible explanation might be how these items are valued by partic-
ipants, or how they perceive their time is valued. Nevertheless, 
this result has the potential to reduce trial costs because associated 
saving could be channelled towards monetary incentives that have 
been shown to be effective. 
The evidence showed that priority post (first-class post or equiva-
lent) did not increase response. It is expensive as a means of com-
municating with participants and savings can be made by using 
regular (2nd-class) post instead. 
Additional reminders sent to non-responders or as questionnaires 
were posted; enhanced letters, that is, letters signed by the princi-
pal investigator, or letters further explaining the anticipated length 
of time to complete a questionnaire, were not effective strategies 
to increase response. Enhanced letters and different types of addi-
tional reminders are used by trialists in current research practice. 
Too many reminders could be counterproductive to improving 
retention in randomised trials and details of the time expected to 
undertake specific tasks might be informative but off putting for 
participants. Nevertheless, letters and reminders are part of the re-
search process and play a role in participant engagement especially 
if there is little face-to-face contact or in trials with long intervals 
between data collection time points. 
Several strategies to increase questionnaire response need further 
evaluation to determine their effect but there is only a suggestion 
that these were effective. If participants are well and engaged with 
a trial, questionnaire length may not impact on response rates be-
cause participants may be happy to feedback on their condition in 
this way. For other conditions, for example, cancers and terminal 
illnesses, trial participants might prefer shorter questionnaires if 
their symptoms are problematic. Telephone follow-up compared 
with monetary incentive sent with a questionnaire needs further 
evaluation possibly with a cost-benefit analysis, as both could be </p>

<p>expensive in time and human resources. Although appearing very 
effective, the total design method for postal questionnaires could 
be labour intensive to implement, expensive and may no longer be 
applicable to some participant groups (e.g. young people), or in 
trials using email, text or the Internet to collect data. Recorded de-
livery could be useful to ensure trial follow-up supplies reach their 
intended destination (e.g. biomedical specimen kits and question-
naires). Careful planning of day, date and time of delivery with 
each participant to avoid inconvenience might be necessary but 
again this strategy has the potential to be burdensome for trial 
co-ordinating centres and trial sites to administer. While trialists 
are assured that follow-up supplies are delivered with this strategy, 
participants might have the added burden of an extra visit to col-
lect supplies from a sorting post office and this could be costly. 
The use of open trials to increase questionnaire response can only 
be applied to trials where blinding is not required and could be 
counterproductive if a participant or clinician has a treatment 
preference. Bias associated with loss to follow-up resulting from 
these preferences could be avoided in blind trials. 
Evaluations of strategies that encourage participants to return to 
trial sites for follow-up visits and monitoring were fewer than 
strategies to increase response to postal and electronic question-
naires, without further evidence case management and behavioural 
strategies cannot be recommended for use to encourage partici-
pant return. 
This review identified no trials from low-income countries. All in-
cluded studies were conducted in higher-income countries. There-
fore, the strategies to increase retention identified by this review 
may not be generalisable to trials conducted in low-income coun-
tries because the interventions identified might not be socially, cul-
turally or economically appropriate for trials run in these regions. 
The results may also not be applicable to all social groups as we 
were unable to examine response/retention by social characteristics 
such as economic disadvantage and social class. Most of the evi-
dence in this review relates to increasing questionnaire follow-up 
in randomised trials for either the primary or secondary outcome 
for the host trial. The diversity between strategies and insufficient 
numbers in each of these categories meant that we could not do 
subgroup analyses by trial setting and disease area as planned. </p>

<p>Quality of the evidence </p>

<p>The extent of unpublished trials evaluating retention strategies is 
unknown; however, this review includes several unpublished trials 
and we made an effort to capture UK-based unpublished trials 
through our survey and research contacts. For some comparisons, 
results were based on one or two trials in a particular context. The 
inclusion of any further published and unpublished trials in future 
updates would improve the precision of the results of this review. 
The six types of strategies that we identified targeted retention of 
trial participants in randomised trials. We believe response and 
retention were the relevant dichotomous outcomes to be reported </p>

<p>for this review. Many other strategies used by trialists in practice 
to reduce attrition/increase response or retention in trials were 
not identified by this review (e.g. social support strategies; child 
care, Loue 2008; family support, De Sousa 2008; reduction in the 
number of visits, Schulz 2002). Evaluations of trial management 
strategies are also under-represented in the review (e.g. evaluations 
of site-specific reports, El Khorazaty 2007; levels of contact by the 
co-ordinating centre, Senturia 1998; training project staff ). 
Both published and unpublished included retention trials were 
fairly well conducted but could be improved. Five of the 39 trials 
included in the review were quasi-randomised. The motivation 
for conducting many of the included retention trials was reactive 
rather than planned upfront (i.e. when loss to follow-up became a 
problem during trial follow-up, rather than planned prior to host 
trial commencement). 
Most trials used appropriate methods for randomisation or at least 
stated that they were randomised. For trials that did not describe 
their methods well or provide further information, there remains a 
potential risk of selection bias. Sensitivity analyses excluding quasi-
randomised trials did not affect the results. In this context, where 
motivating participants to provide data or attend clinics is often 
the target of the interventions and so appropriately influences the 
outcome, lack of blinding is less of a concern. Retention is the out-
come and was obtained for all but two trials, so similarly, attrition 
and selective outcome reporting bias are unimportant. Although 
the retention trials were fairly well conducted, they could be im-
proved and they were often poorly reported. This may be because 
they were designed when loss to follow-up became a problem in a 
trial, rather than preplanned prior to host trial commencement. </p>

<p>Potential biases in the review process </p>

<p>Many words are used to describe loss to follow-up, for example, at-
trition, withdrawal and questionnaire non-response. We included 
these in our search strategy. We attempted to obtain unpublished 
trials and data by contacting authors and writing to UK clinical 
trials units and presenting at national and international confer-
ences. We are confident that we have captured most studies and 
the spectrum of strategies that have been evaluated to date. It 
is conceivable, however, that less well-reported, ongoing, unpub-
lished trials or trials conducted outside of the UK might have been 
missed. Most trials used appropriate methods for sequence gener-
ation or at least stated that they were randomised and concealed 
allocation. There is small risk that those that did not describe their 
methods well or provide further information did not use adequate 
methods for allocation and concealment and may have biased the 
results. However, sensitivity analyses excluding quasi-randomised 
trials did not affect the results. Blinding is hard to achieve in this 
context, where motivating participants to provide data or attend 
clinics is often the target of the interventions and so appropriately 
influences the outcome. </p>

<p>Agreements and disagreements with other 
studies or reviews </p>

<p>The strategies that improve retention are, in some cases, the same 
as or similar to those found to be effective for cohort and cross-
sectional study designs. However, prior to our review, it was not 
clear which of these strategies could be extrapolated to randomised 
trials. Successful retention strategies used in other study designs 
may be effective in trials settings and should be tested. Edwards' 
review on methods to increase response to postal and electronic 
questionnaires included 513 trials and identified many strategies 
to increase response to questionnaires (Edwards 2009). Included 
trials were embedded in surveys, cohort studies and trials, which 
may explain some of the heterogeneity in effects seen in Edwards' 
review and reliance on the random-effects model. Unexplained 
heterogeneity was not a particular problem in this review. Ed-
wards found monetary incentives effective for increasing response 
to postal questionnaires (Edwards 2009). However, unlike our re-
view, Edwards found that non-monetary incentives were effective 
for postal and electronic questionnaires. Other strategies found to 
be effective by Edwards, in agreement with our review, included 
recorded delivery of questionnaires and shorter questionnaires, al-
though in our review shorter questionnaires need further eval-
uation. Edwards also found that use of hand-written addresses, 
stamped return envelopes as opposed to franked return envelopes 
and first-class outward mailing improved response. Our review 
found that a 'package' including an enhanced letter incorporating 
several reminders was effective, but the effectiveness of first-class/ 
priority mail to increase response in randomised trials was unclear. 
Booker's narrative review of methods to increase retention in pop-
ulation-based cohort studies was based on only 11 randomised 
trials and no meta-analysis (Booker 2011). The results suggested 
that incentives were associated with an increase in retention. 
Nakash's systematic review of ways to increase response to postal 
questionnaires in health care focused on randomised trials of ways 
to increase response to postal questionnaires in healthcare research 
on participant populations (Nakash 2006 (2). Fifteen trials were 
included in this meta-analysis, which found that reminder letters, 
telephone contact and short questionnaires increased response to 
postal questionnaires in the context of healthcare research. There 
was no evidence that incentives were effective. Again, this review 
was not exclusive to evaluations conducted in randomised trials. 
The Edwards review was broad and focused specifically on meth-
ods to enhance response to questionnaires and included studies in 
non-healthcare settings (Edwards 2009). The reviews by Nakash 
and Booker focused on retention in specific research areas, health 
care and cohort studies (Booker 2011; Nakash 2006 (2)). Unlike 
these reviews, our review focused specifically on a range of strate-
gies evaluated within trials. Therefore, it specifically addressed the 
question of retention of study participants within randomised tri-
als, which was beyond the scope of the other reviews. Application 
of these results would depend on trial setting, population, dis-
ease area, data collection and follow-up procedures. Moreover, we </p>

<p>identified additional strategies that may improve trial retention, 
for example, methodological strategies. 
This review is the most comprehensive to date on strategies specif-
ically designed to improve retention in randomised trials. We in-
cluded seven unpublished trials and 18 other trials not included 
by Edwards (Edwards 2009). </p>

<p>Implication for methodological research </p>

<p>Trialists may consider including well thought out and adequately 
powered evaluations of strategies to increase retention in ran-
domised trials. This could include a clear definition of retention 
strategies and of measures of retention. Trialists conducting fu-
ture methodology trials can consider incorporating evaluations of 
strategies to increase retention at the design stage so that power, 
sample size and funding arrangements are taken into account. 
Retention trials were often poorly reported without consort di-
agrams, clear primary outcomes, sample size, sociodemographic 
composition or power calculations. Considerable time was spent 
contacting authors for unreported data needed for a robust meta-
analysis. Trialists in their reports might consider adhering to the 
consort guidelines for trial reporting, which would facilitate the 
synthesis of results in future methodology reviews. There is less 
research on ways to increase return of participants to trial sites for 
follow-up and on the effectiveness of strategies to retain trial sites 
in cluster and individual randomised trials. Research in both areas 
would be very beneficial to trialists. There is no current system for 
identifying methodological trials in progress, until a system is set 
up it may be useful for systematic review authors to incorporate 
contacting trials units into their search strategy. </p>

2-arm randomised trial </p>

<p>Data 
Adults aged 18-65 years who provided email or mobile telephone contact details for receiving 
electronic reminders for follow-up in a migraine prevention trial </p>

<p>Comparisons 
1. Electronic reminder: either SMS text message, email message, or both sent after the 4-week 
follow-up study questionnaire sent 
2. No electronic reminder sent </p>

<p>Outcomes 
Primary: questionnaire response rate defined as proportion of questionnaires returned by 
participants at final analysis at 40 days 
Secondary: time to response </p>

<p>Notes 
Retention trial embedded in a randomised trial evaluating the effectiveness of food elimination 
diet based on the ELISA test for food sensitivity for prevention of migraine. Primary outcome 
for the migraine prevention trial (host trial): change in the number of headache days over 
12 weeks using the migraine disability assessment questionnaire (MIDAS). Retention trial 
identified through mail out to UK clinical trials units </p>

was responsible for generating the allocation sequence and assigning 
participants" </p>

<p>Adequate sequence generation? 
Unclear 
"Randomly generated numbers used to list all participants by ID 
[identification] number who had provided a mobile phone number 
and/or and email address. The first half of listed participants were 
allocated to the intervention group the remaining participants were 
allocated to the control group" </p>

<p>Methods 
Randomised trial </p>

<p>Data 
Adults aged ≥ 70 years with a low trauma osteoporotic fracture in the past 10 years recruited 
in 1 centre of the RECORD trial </p>

<p>Comparisons 
1. An open version of the RECORD trial otherwise identical in design 
2. RECORD trial, a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled factorial design of oral 
calcium 1 g daily and or vitamin D 800 IU/20 µg supplementation </p>

<p>Outcomes 
Proportion of eligible participants recruited 
Proportion remaining in the trial at 1 year 
Proportion compliant on pill counts at 8 months </p>

<p>Notes 
Open version of the Randomised Evaluation of Calcium or Vitamin D (RECORD) Trial 
treated as the intervention group in the analysis. Proportion retained at 4, 8 and 12 months 
were reported. Primary outcome for the randomised double-blind placebo-controlled version 
of the RECORD trial was all new low-energy fractures </p>

<p>Allocation concealment? 
Yes 
Authors response "the trial statisticians gener-
ated the randomisation sequence with partic-
ipants identified by ID [identification] num-
ber only and the trial manager implemented 
it manually" </p>

<p>Adequate sequence generation? 
Yes 
Authors response "participants were ran-
domised after recruitment but before follow-
up to a GBP10 or GBP20 incentive. Ran-
domisation to increased incentive was through 
simple permutation of the list of remaining 
recruits" </p>

<p>Blinding? 
Unclear 
Authors response "allocation sequences were 
generated without participants' knowledge". 
"For those allocated to the increased amount 
of GBP20, this was revealed in a 3 month fol-
low-up email. Those allocated to GBP10 were 
not aware that others were offered GBP20 (un-
less friends had enrolled and had discussed the 
study). Since the trial recruited participants 
online from all over the UK, this will have re-
duced the chance of bias due to contamina-
tion" </p>

<p>Leidy 2000 
Retention study appears to be a randomised trial but no response from authors to establish if retention was an 
outcome. For the substudy, trial sites randomised to 1 of 2 orders of administration of quality of life questionnaires. 
Response rates not reported. Missing data, internal consistency reliability, mean score values, relationship between 
the 2 measures evaluated </p>

<p>Marsh 1999 
Host study was not a randomised trial. "Practices were randomly allocated to the intervention group using 
random number tables. Each intervention practice matched with one control practice" </p>

Retention study not a randomised trial. Authors confirm strategies to improve retention were not evaluated in 
an Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) substudy </p>

<p>Poling 2006 
Substudy aim is about diagnostic compliance. 4-arm trial comparing contingency management with or without 
active bupropion and voucher control with or without active bupropion. Here contingency management and 
voucher control are aimed at getting information on the disease condition/response to treatment for the primary 
outcome of the host trial i.e. negative urine sample for cocaine and opioids. Contingency management and 
voucher control are not related to retention in the host trial but related to diagnostic compliance </p>

<p>We grouped trials according to: the type of strategy used, whether the strategy was compared with usual follow-up or other strategies. 
The diversity of trials and interventions identified in the review were not anticipated. Therefore, the prespecified analyses were not 
appropriate. Instead, new subgroups were defined prior to analyses. We had planned to include trials that were targeted at treatment or 
follow-up compliance. We have only included trials that targeted follow-up compliance as the strategies used are transferable to other 
trials. We had planned to assess whether retention was immediate or longer term (e.g. if a response to a questionnaire was expected 
immediately or at time points in the future). Time points were poorly reported, where these were reported we used data for this analysis 
for the primary outcome time point, there was insufficient reporting of this variable to group other time points for further analysis. We 
had also planned to group participant or management-focused strategies. Only one unpublished trial (Land) evaluated a management-
focused strategy to reduce attrition. </p>

<p>As treatment compliance was not a focus of this review, search strategies with the terms 'compliance' were removed for the 2009 to 
2012 updates. Most untruncated 'response' search terms were removed because hits relating to 'response' were captured by the search 
term 'response*'. To avoid references to treatment response, the search term 'questionnaire' was added to 'response' in all remaining 
search terms with 'response' or 'response*' to make the search specific to questionnaire response. Search updates (2009 to 2012) for 
EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were de duplicated in Ovid. MEDLINE and EMBASE records were excluded for search updates 
in CENTRAL. C2 Spectre and ERIC searches were not updated from 1 May 2009, as C2-SPECTR geb9101.gse.upenn.edu/: was not 
accessible and the search platform for ERIC changed from Datastarweb to Proquest in December 2011. The latter limits searches to 
10 lines of text. </p>
