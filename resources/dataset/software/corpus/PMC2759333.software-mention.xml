<p>Conversion disorder ('hysteria') was largely considered to be a neurological problem in the 19th century, but without a 
neuropathological explanation it was commonly assimilated with malingering. The theories of Janet and Freud transformed 
hysteria into a psychiatric condition, but as such models decline in popularity and a neurobiology of conversion has yet to be 
found, today's neurologists once again face a disorder without an accepted model. This article explores how today's neurologists 
understand conversion through in-depth interviews with 22 neurology consultants. The neurologists endorsed psychological 
models but did not understand their patients in such terms. Rather, they distinguished conversion from other unexplained 
conditions clinically by its severity and inconsistency. While many did not see this as clearly distinct from feigning, they did 
not feel that this was their problem to resolve. They saw themselves as 'agnostic' regarding non-neuropathological explanations. 
However, since neurologists are in some ways more expert in conversion than psychiatrists, their continuing support for the 
deception model is important, and begs an explanation. One reason for the model's persistence may be that it is employed as 
a diagnostic device, used to differentiate between those unexplained symptoms that could, in principle, have a medical 
explanation and those that could not. </p>

<p>and neurologists struggled to explain its symptoms on the basis of 
conscious or unconscious behaviour. Both Carter and Weir 
Mitchell saw conscious deception as being the mechanism of the 
later stages of hysteria but Charcot resisted this inference, even 
though it had been his clinical-anatomic method which had shown 
the absence of explanatory lesions in the brains of hysterics. He 
insisted that a 'functional' lesion would be found when microscopes 
were sufficiently powerful, and offered the first systematic psycho-
logical theory of hysteria, as hypnosis, until that time (Shorter, 
1992). Although his theory did not survive his death, his great 
achievement, according to Freud, 'was to restore dignity to the 
topic. Little by little, people gave up the scornful smile with 
which the patient could at that time feel certain of being met. 
She was no longer necessarily a malingerer, for Charcot had 
thrown the whole weight of his authority on the side of the gen-
uineness and objectivity of hysterical phenomena.' (Freud, 1953) 
Charcot's theory was rapidly supplanted by the more resilient 
theories of his students, Pierre Janet (dissociation) and Sigmund 
Freud (conversion). Since then hysteria has been considered a 
psychiatric disorder, and the problem of diagnosis properly one 
for psychiatrists. And although 'Hysteria' is no longer used in 
the psychiatric manuals, the psychological concepts associated 
with it still are. The diagnostic schema ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) 
and DSM-IV (APA, 1994) employ the categories of 'Dissociative 
(Conversion) Disorder' and 'Conversion Disorder', respectively, to 
describe motor and sensory symptoms that lack a neurological 
explanation, which are not feigned and where a psychosocial 
explanation can be demonstrated. However, the requirement for 
such an explanation is a problem for psychiatrists as the Freudian 
orthodoxy declines, and the hope of a neuropsychological alter-
native remains unfulfilled (Kozlowska, 2005). The diagnostic crite-
ria are now widely considered unreliable or invalid (Wessely, 
2001), and the psychiatric community is searching for a way to 
replace them (Mayou et al., 2005). 
But there is no getting away from the extent to which neuro-
logists, in the UK at least, are those who sit 'in the psychiatrist's 
chair'. Neurologists are still largely the ones who manage conver-
sion, who make the psychiatric referrals, who have that first 
difficult conversation-and they do not find that position comfort-
able (Carson et al., 2004; Hallett, 2006). Faced with a condition 
that still resists neuropathological explanation, with fading hope of 
a psychiatric explanation, do they once again assimilate it with 
malingering? When perhaps the majority of their patients' symp-
toms are to some extent unexplained, on what basis do they 
single out a special 'conversion' group? We set out to explore 
neurologists' beliefs about the condition they think of as 'conver-
sion disorder' through a series of in-depth interviews: what do 
they think it is, what do they think it is not, and why. </p>

<p>Interviewing neurologists </p>

<p>We approached all practising consultant neurologists (doctors who 
had completed all neurology training, and were included on the 
specialist neurology register) in a large NHS region, and sought 
further recruitment by snowball sampling-participants were asked 
to nominate a neurologist whose views were different to their 
own-until the interviews stopped yielding new views (known as </p>

<p>thematic saturation) (Ritchie and Lewis, 2003). R.K. interviewed 
the neurologists at a time and place of their choosing, the 
interview taking between 35 and 70 min. These were 'depth 
interviews' which employed a topic guide to provide a bare 
structure, with the material covered adapted to each interview. 
The subject was 'conversion disorder' and no definition of this 
was offered by the interviewer. The topics included the neurolo-
gist's background, training and current practice, examples of 
memorable or current patients considered to have 'conversion 
disorder', the neurologist's definitions, exclusions, models and 
diagnostic practices. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded and 
transcribed, and were inductively analysed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">NVIVO</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">7</rs> 
software. Transcripts were coded by question, and, iteratively, 
by emerging themes, consistent with an approach known as 
grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). The study was 
approved by the local research ethics committee, and all the 
participants gave written, informed consent. 
Twenty-two neurologists were interviewed, from a potential 
pool of 35 in the region. Their ages ranged from 39 to 
63 years, with a median age of 45. Seven were female, 15 
were male. Seventeen were white, two were from the Middle 
East and three from the Indian subcontinent. They had been 
medically qualified for 14-39 years (median 20 years), received 
their medical training in the UK (15), other developed countries 
(five) and the Indian subcontinent (two). Two had been mature 
medical students. Five had worked as psychiatrists earlier in their 
training (for between 6 weeks and 3 years), eight had worked on 
a national neuropsychiatry service (as neurologists) and two had 
pursued research in psychiatry. In terms of current work, all were 
attached to a regional neuroscience centre in London, with most 
working in district general hospitals in other counties for the bulk 
of their practice. Three held academic appointments, but all with 
substantial clinical commitments. All were 'general' neurologists, 
except for one who saw only headache, one who worked only 
with movement disorders and three who worked largely or 
exclusively with epilepsy. </p>

<p>What is conversion disorder? </p>

<p>All those interviewed recognized the concept of 'conversion 
disorder'. Many reported pre-clinical exposure to conversion 
disorder or a condition they considered similar-seven had recog-
nized it in family members, one in a friend and one in their youn-
ger self. All but five said they saw conversion commonly in their 
work-constituting up to 20% of their workload. One reported 
seeing it less commonly than earlier in their training, two felt that 
it was now uncommon, and one that it was rare to see it 'in its 
severe form' (S06). One reported not seeing it at all, and 
wondered whether it still existed. 
The neurologists revealed a wide range of views on the nature 
of conversion disorder. Their definitions incorporated both physical 
and psychological elements, but felt only the physical was their 
area of expertise. Physically, they saw it as a more severe con-
dition than other neurologically unexplained symptoms. They 
thought it to have a psychological basis, though the precise 
nature of that was felt to be something for psychiatrists rather 
than neurologists. The issue of conscious feigning (usually </p>



<p>R. Kanaan et al. </p>

<p>described in terms of 'malingering') was prominent in the inter-
views, but the neurologists were evenly divided as to whether this 
was a factor in the presentation of conversion disorder. Those who 
thought it was not often did so on the basis of clinical conviction 
or because they found the alternative unbearable. Others, how-
ever, had views which clearly accommodated feigning, and some 
were unapologetic in their suspicions. </p>

<p>Clinical distinctions </p>

<p>The neurologists reported that they often had an inkling that an 
organic explanation for the patients' symptoms would not be 
found within the first few minutes of the clinical encounter. </p>

<p>. . . you usually have a fairly good instinct fairly early on as to 
whether this is going to turn out to be anything . . . (S16) </p>

<p>. . . you often have a feeling . . . when you first see people in 
clinic that you may not identify the structural cause for their 
problem. (S21) </p>

<p>This did not lead to skimping on the examination or investigations, 
however, where confirmation was sought. They described an 
accumulation of indicators that required caution in interpretation: 
caution, because there were few certainties, because the 'positive 
signs' of conversion were unreliable, and because there were 
invariably cases that proved to be organic despite negative tests 
and a suggestive examination. They relied most heavily on 
evidence of inconsistency-either passively observed, or actively 
induced by 'tricks': </p>

<p>There are certain things that lead you to believe that this 
is psychogenic . . . but they are not totally reliable . . . and so I 
tend to do things that are more confirmatory . . . which is really 
to trick the patient into . . . doing things they don't believe they 
can do . . . for example, if they're completely paralysed and you 
can distract them into having a normal gait . . . (S22) </p>

<p>I've got other ways of finding out whether their weakness is real 
or not . . . inconsistencies between functional assessment and 
formal testing . . . their ability to walk or get out of a chair, 
with apparently no power when you actually formally test 
them on the bed -that sort of inconsistency. (S13) </p>

<p>These signs were used to differentiate conversion, not only from 
organic neurology, but also from other unexplained symptoms. 
There, the distinction was between unexplained symptoms for 
which the doctor believed a neuropathological explanation could, 
in principle, be found, and unexplained symptoms where no such 
explanation seemed possible even in principle, since the 'trick' 
had revealed something that contradicted accepted physiology: </p>

<p>I got [a patient with apparent paraparesis] out of his chair and 
said, ''Let's go for a run; you may be able to run but you can't 
walk''. And we ran up and down the ward together . . . That 
worked . . . it was a trick . . . (S10) </p>

<p>Whereas other unexplained symptoms, though they didn't quite 
'add up' to a particular disorder, still seemed to suggest organicity </p>

<p>even though the test to prove that was not available or not 
warranted: </p>

<p>We all get thrown by the patient in outpatients who comes 
along with some weird symptoms that don't make sense and 
they've got an up-going plantar . . . and then you do every single 
test and you'll find that's all negative . . . that's the sort of 
patient who I wouldn't say has got a conversion disorder but 
I'd say, well look, I don't know what's wrong with you . . . there 
are one or two signs that I have difficulty to explain but . . . let's 
just wait and see. (S13) </p>

<p>Some made this distinction in part on the type of symptoms-
conversion presented with more 'florid' symptoms such as 
paralysis, seizures or blindness. By contrast, the symptoms which 
neurologists considered to have an undiscovered physical basis 
tended to be 'mild', 'normal', 'physiological' occurrences over 
which the patient had unnecessary concern-a sort of health 
anxiety which the neurologist could readily understand: </p>

<p>How many times do I . . . wake up with a tingle here or a tingle 
there . . . and you think, ''Oh . . . there's nothing majorly amiss'', 
while there are other people who will think, ''Oh my god, 
there's something wrong . . . I need to go and see my 
doctor'' . . . That's not conversion disorder. (S14) </p>

<p>Well, some of their symptoms are probably organically based, 
it's just that the importance to which they attach them is 
different . . . and I say it's hard enough for me as a neurologist 
to know whether the symptoms are going to be serious enough, 
so how can we expect you to know . . . (S22) </p>

<p>Conversion symptoms were rather different, perhaps in terms of 
the psychological construct (they were 'psychogenic'), but also in 
the degree of disability, the burden to the neurologist, or the way 
they made the neurologist feel. </p>

<p>. . . the person who just keeps coming back to see you because 
they've got this symptom and that symptom . . . I put them in a 
different category because they are not . . . well, I suppose you 
have to use the word 'troublesome'. . . It's all about how they 
make me feel . . . (S17) </p>

<p>This feeling was associated with the patient's illness behaviour, 
which differed between the groups: </p>

<p>. . . the conversion disorder patients are just not happy with 
[negative tests]. . . however many tests you do . . . they're still 
not satisfied . . . (S14) </p>

<p>. . . in a conversion disorder, it is not just about physical symp-
toms . . . there is a group of things that come together into dis-
tinctly abnormal behaviour . . . (S18) </p>

<p>In summary, there were various ways in which neurologists 
defined the conversion group within the range of unexplained 
symptoms. They formed a group which was thought less likely 
to have an underlying physical cause, which was more disabled, </p>

<p>In the psychiatrist's chair </p>

<p>Brain 2009: 132; 2889-2896 | 2891 </p>

<p>more difficult to treat and caused more work for the neurologist. 
We might describe these collectively by saying they were more 
severe. But the group was also associated with a psychological 
formulation-a formulation other than 'being anxious over 
normal symptoms'. </p>

<p>The psychological formulation </p>

<p>The requirement for a psychological understanding was promi-
nently included, usually very early in the interview. Many began 
with a confident statement of a position which closely echoed the 
psychiatric criteria, and may be considered 'textbook': </p>

<p>. . . in essence physical symptoms of a psychological origin result-
ing from some kind of psychological distress which is expressed 
through those physical symptoms for some indirect gain or even 
direct gain on the part of the patient. The symptoms are not 
under volitional control . . . (S01) </p>

<p>The 'psychological understanding' was described in various forms. 
On the one hand it was seen as a background of distress 
or personality difficulties which would provide a reason for 
developing the disorder: </p>

<p>. . . there's a background, something about the patient . . . 
they've got stresses in their life or . . . the event came on after 
some sort of [problem] . . . also what sort of person they are 
too . . . if they're a very anxious, stressed person . . . and also 
obviously their . . . early upbringing . . . (S11) </p>

<p>On the other hand, it was also used to describe the transformative 
process itself-the mechanism whereby problems result in a 
physical presentation. So, there were appeals to psychological 
constructs such as repression, conversion or dissociation: </p>

<p>The way I would see conversion disorders is that basically the 
mechanisms that people use to keep whatever it is at bay have 
failed. . . (S03) </p>

<p>. . . conversion disorder is a translation of . . . tensions in the 
psyche presenting . . . as symptoms that are perceived as 
genuine symptoms. (S22) </p>

<p>I suppose maybe it's similar to being in a kind of dreamlike 
state where you're not concentrating on what you're 
doing . . . (S02) </p>

<p>But most would not go so far as to specify a mechanism. Many 
would offer only a bare-bones model of psychological cause: </p>

<p>In terms of . . . what the causation is . . . I suppose I would rather 
pharisaically put it as 'psychological factors'. . . (S18) </p>

<p>And it was very common to describe the link as being in terms of 
the 'manifestation' or 'expression' of psychological problems as 
physical-terms which maintain a relationship between ground 
and consequence while leaving the relationship unclear. Indeed, </p>

<p>there was often a statement of uncertainty at the core of the 
neurologist's response: </p>

<p>I don't understand it. I imagine . . . here we're just going into 
speculation . . . I haven't really thought about it . . . but I suppose 
at a very crude level I imagine sort of that . . . I don't know . . . it's 
at an unconscious level . . . (S05) </p>

<p>Well, I don't really know . . . I can't say . . . I suppose it's . . . well I 
suppose it's maybe their way of dealing with problems they 
can't solve . . . (S11) </p>

<p>Though the neurologists thought the patient could perhaps be 
understood psychologically, they did not see themselves as doing 
so. Those who adduced the 'textbook' psychological model did not 
expound their model in a more sustained way. Its advocates would 
argue for it on the basis that it was what they had been told, or 
taught, and it wasn't necessarily their own view-even that it was 
not really of their concern, as it was outside of their field: </p>

<p>I don't know, it's what comes to my mind . . . it's not my 
particular clinical interest. (S19) </p>

<p>Though this was often presented as a limit imposed by the 
exigencies of their practice: </p>

<p>I guess my role, as I often say to them, is I'm an electrician: I'll 
tell you about the hardwiring and I can try and tell you a little 
bit about what I think about soft wiring . . . But you know it 
takes a lot of discussion . . . which is not a luxury that we have 
in our clinics. (S16) </p>

<p>I'm a neurologist so, much that I may find the psychiatric symp-
toms interesting, it's not my bag you know, because they're an 
enormous burden to my clinic. And so what I want to do is to 
get them appropriate care . . . I don't want to be doing amateur 
psychotherapy on patients . . . (S22) </p>

<p>The major exception to this came from the neurologist who never 
saw 'conversion' and doubted it existed. This doctor treated only 
headache, but also had a well-developed explanatory and thera-
peutic (cognitive-behavioural) model in which they were actively 
engaged. But for most, the neurologists' involvement ended with 
excluding 'electrical' explanations, they did not have the time or 
the need to address the question of what did explain it-including 
whether it might be explained by conscious behaviour: </p>

<p>I can't help being intellectually curious about it. But on 
an everyday level, no . . . I'm not sure it does matter . . . many 
people can start with this notion of trying to sort this out -is it 
conscious or otherwise -but . . . you soon forget about it when 
you're doing real neurology . . . (S17) </p>

<p>The distinction from feigning </p>

<p>Feigning was an almost unavoidable issue-all but two of the 
neurologists brought it up, often under the rubric of 'malingering', 
though a broader range of behaviours was probably intended. </p>



<p>R. Kanaan et al. </p>

<p>The distinction was often brought up in the 'textbook' fashion, 
as part of the definition of conversion offered, as above, or as 
a statement of conviction against a background of psychological 
incomprehension: </p>

<p>I just cannot understand these people . . . from a psychological 
point of view. I've got no idea. But I don't think it's 
malingering. (S04) </p>

<p>I think in the majority of cases . . . the patients are not putting it 
on . . . Whether there is any form of subconscious gain . . . I don't 
know. (S16) </p>

<p>The source of the conviction was difficult to locate, however: </p>

<p>I suppose it's just clinical intuition. . . (S06) </p>

<p>. . . sometimes it's just a feeling . . . I can't explain it better than 
that. (S11) </p>

<p>Some would appeal explicitly to authority: </p>

<p>This is what we've been taught. (S05) </p>

<p>Or to the fact that the alternative was too awful to contemplate: </p>

<p>I think many of us would find it . . . truly horrible to consider 
that . . . patients who we see are putting it on for conscious 
gain. (S18) </p>

<p>And a position of trust was held by some to be the only pragmatic 
choice: </p>

<p>. . . my initial approach would always be to take at face value 
what somebody is telling me in a clinical consultation . . . if I got 
that wrong and I thought somebody was trying to mislead me 
and they actually were not doing . . . that would . . . destroy any 
relationship with that patient . . . and I would rather be naively 
trusting than try to undermine what patients were telling me. 
(S01) </p>

<p>But without raising the question, the neurologists sometimes 
remained suspicious: </p>

<p>. . . the number of people I've seen over the years and I've 
thought, ''Is this person malingering? Are they putting it on for 
my benefit?'' I have great difficulty sorting that one out. (S14) </p>

<p>In fact, most of the neurologists described the relationship 
between feigning and conversion as difficult to delineate clearly. 
Commonly, this was because the two were conceived as being on 
a continuum: </p>

<p>. . . there's a spectrum which we could call abnormal illness 
behaviour. On the one end is . . . fictitious misbehaviour and on 
the other end . . . are the people who misperceive symptoms as 
being those of the disease . . . in the middle are those people 
who create physical symptoms as a manifestation of their 
psychological distress. (S13) </p>

<p>The conversion is not manipulation, supposedly; it's not 
somebody who is malingering, supposedly; though I find it 
very difficult to draw the line very clearly between the 
two . . . (S12) </p>

<p>And often when the neurologists described characteristic or 
memorable conversion cases these cases would evince feigning 
or conscious control: </p>

<p>. . .[a patient] was admitted with paraparesis which . . . seemed to 
be exaggerated . . . the consultant got him to walk and he 
crashed into some IV drip-stand and caused a great deal of 
commotion and the consultant sort of told everyone just to 
leave him there and he would get up, there was nothing 
wrong with him. And he did. (S06) </p>

<p>. . . her main aim of coming to hospital is in a state which A&amp;E 
people in different places who haven't seen her get very 
concerned, and then she . . . tries to avoid any interaction from 
us because we know the scenario . . . It may not be one hundred 
percent [deliberate] but I think eighty percent . . . I would think 
that's truly a conversion . . . (S20) </p>

<p>There were some neurologists who found the distinction to be 
relatively unimportant-not because it was clear and simple, but 
because the distinction was (at least medically) irrelevant. So, 
for example, it was argued that consciousness was a post facto 
reconstruction, and not causally operative: </p>

<p>There is only the behaviour of the brain and part of that behav-
iour is to produce something that we call consciousness . . . to us 
it feels like there is an 'I' . . . that is in control. Well, that's prob-
ably not how it is at all . . . (S10) </p>

<p>Others argued that deception itself was pervasive, and therefore 
not diagnostically helpful: </p>

<p>. . . insight changes from minute to minute; we're all at times 
insightful and at times we're not insightful; we're all at times 
honest and dishonest. (S22) </p>

<p>It was even argued that deception would be more common in 
conversion disorder precisely because the patient would strive to 
convince the doctor of the reality of their problem-they might lie 
to convince the doctor of the truth as they saw it: </p>

<p>. . . sometimes 
there 
is 
maybe 
conscious 
over-
exaggeration . . . [a patient] was very well walking on the arm 
of her friend who was very supportive . . . but when I assessed 
her on the couch it was much more difficult: she wanted to 
prove to me that she was really unwell. (S15) </p>

<p>And it was held by some that ultimately the distinction, though 
important from other points of view, was not a medical issue: </p>

<p>I'd have to be a saint to say it didn't alter my view of the 
patient sometimes . . . but it shouldn't do. It's not your job to 
make any sort of value judgement . . . (S10) </p>

<p>In the psychiatrist's chair </p>

<p>Brain 2009: 132; 2889-2896 | 2893 </p>

<p>. . . if I've got a patient that is malingering . . . I'll do what I 
have to do as a neurologist and if they have one over me, 
well good for them -let the insurance company or the police 
sort it out. (S17) </p>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that in being asked about 'conver-
sion disorder', a term perhaps more psychiatric than neurological, 
the neurologists may have felt encouraged to speak more freely 
about deception (and about psychogenesis) than if they had been 
asked about, say, 'functional disorders'. And their discussions may 
have been subject to a social-desirability bias, as some of the 
subjects will have known or guessed that the interviewer was 
a psychiatrist. In an attempt to assess the latter, subjects were 
asked to speculate on the views of the interviewer. Most insisted 
that they had no idea: 'I don't know, you've been entirely bland, 
I don't know.' (S05) But those who offered a guess at the inter-
viewer's views did tend to say 'the same as me' (S13), or a more 
flattering version, such as 'a slightly more sophisticated way of 
what we're saying' (S06). And those who expressed a categorical 
view said they thought the interviewer would take a biological 
perspective: 'I would guess that you have an organic model of 
psychiatry' (S22). Taken together, this does tend to suggest that 
there was a significant interviewer effect-however, it seems 
that the effect would have generally been such as to discourage 
explanations in terms of malingering, making the prominence of 
such explanations in the interviews more striking still. </p>

<p>The problem of feigning </p>

<p>The neurologists we interviewed had a wide range of views on 
conversion, many of them clearly reached after a great deal 
of careful thought. They may have been an unusual group, of 
course, being metropolitan to a degree, attached to an academic 
unit, but also with comparatively ready access to neuropsychiatry. 
We spoke with the majority of the neurologists in the region, and 
our 'snowball sampling' should have helped us to capture the full 
range of views. A sample collected and analysed in this way 
cannot claim to accurately represent the frequency with which 
views are held, but it does aim to robustly characterize the 
conceptual spread. 
The neurologists described a number of ways of understanding 
'conversion disorder'. Symptomatically, it was seen as a more 
severe unexplained condition where a neuropathological explana-
tion was unlikely to be forthcoming; they also acknowledged that 
there was probably a psychological explanation, but did not feel 
this was their concern; and they also found the distinction 
from feigning much less clear than the psychiatric manuals 
would mandate, again without feeling this distinction was neces-
sarily important. This tells us that many neurologists like to see 
their authority and responsibility ending when the neuropatholo-
gical explanation has been excluded: they can be 'agnostic' about 
what other explanations are effective, whether these are psycho-
logical or social. This is an appealing position, supported by 
both neurology (Hallett, 2006) and psychiatry (Miller, 1988). 
The exclusion of organic pathology can be done effectively </p>

<p>(Stone et al., 2005), and the confusion about mechanisms left 
to psychiatrists. But there are problems with this 'agnostic' stance. 
Firstly, although this delimited role is appealing, it may not be 
realistic: conversion may be considered a primary psychiatric dis-
order (by psychiatrists, at least), but it is managed largely by 
neurologists (Mace and Trimble, 1991). This would seem to put 
neurologists in the difficult position of operating outside of their 
perceived expertise. But there are several ways in which expertise 
can be understood: it might reflect a particular understanding, 
a therapeutic technique, or extensive experience. On the basis 
of experience, neurologists could clearly claim considerably greater 
expertise than psychiatrists. And, as described in the introduction, 
the psychiatric claim to greater insight or therapeutic expertise is 
also in question as psychoanalytic models continue to lose ground 
within the profession. Neurological expertise may be importantly 
different, but they are experts nonetheless. 
Secondly, many of the neurologists are not simply 'agnostic', 
they are avoidant: they believe or suspect feigning in many 
cases, but do not, for a variety of reasons, pursue it (Kanaan 
and Wessely, in press). While many acknowledged this freely, 
there were others whose discussion suggested it-in giving 
'conversion' examples which involved feigning, or in the ready 
'Freudian slips' into such language as 'fictitious' or 'not real' 
when speaking of their conversion patients' symptoms. 
Thirdly, neurologists making a judgement about origins would 
explain what is otherwise puzzling about their division of the 
unexplained. The neurologists had a hierarchy of the unexplained, 
dividing them into those which could probably be explained 
(if circumstances permitted) and those which could not possibly 
be so in the current scheme. Thus 'impossibility' would seem to be 
how conversion was identified. And saying a symptom was 
'impossible' would seem to imply that there must be some kind 
of different explanation, without saying what kind of explanation 
that is-an agnostic position. But deciding that something is 
impossible-that it is incommensurate with a scientific model-
cannot readily be done in practice: there are always further con-
ditions, further refinements which can be made to accommodate 
exceptions (Feyerabend, 1970). Consider the example most cited, 
of the gross inconsistency between function on-and-off the exam-
ination couch. This is certainly odd, but not clearly impossible: it 
merely requires an impairment which varies with the context, of 
which there are multiple other examples from neurology. Some 
additional, prior conception is required-something which argues 
that this kind of inconsistency is different from the inconsistencies 
that could be physically explained. That conception could be 'mal-
ingering'-conscious control: the neurologist could compare the 
symptoms with those that they might themselves consciously 
adduce. The gross inconsistency of their patient would not be 
impossible therefore, but it would be implausible: it would 
be exactly what they would do if they were pretending to be 
paralysed. 
Of course, it is unlikely that our neurologists are approaching 
this entirely as scientists; it is much more likely that they employ 
various clinical heuristics and recognize certain patterns as 
being those which predict a diagnosis of conversion. Conversion 
patients are just those with particular patterns of symptoms, 
of inconsistency, of disability, of illness behaviour, of how they </p>

<p>make neurologists feel. But then the question would be why this 
cluster of negative features comes to be associated together, and 
why is there this residual association with 'malingering', after 100 
years of psychiatric orthodoxy saying otherwise? 
There are three ways in which we might understand this. 
First, that these are simply associated features of the disorder-
the neurologists are merely correctly identifying them. Patients 
with conversion disorder have deceptive, behavioural or psycho-
logical characteristics that evoke these responses in people. They 
are just unlucky enough to have a condition, a 'natural kind' 
(Kendell and Jablensky, 2003) that makes people dislike and 
distrust them. But this does seem to objectify the dislikeable and 
to blame the patient, so the alternative view has been that these 
characteristics are actually features of the neurologist: patients 
with conversion put the neurologist in the unwelcome position 
of having to admit the limits of their competence, which the 
neurologist projects onto their hapless patient as dislike. This 
view updates a long tradition in hysteria revisionism, which has 
sought explanations for hysteria in the broader relationships of 
doctors with their patients-for example, in the historical reinter-
pretation of hysteria as misogyny (Micale, 1995). But it does not 
explain why just these patients, of all the unexplained, should be 
thought of in this way. The third view, the view we present here, 
is somewhat different, and is in essence that 'malingering' is 
actually the preferred model for the neurologists-it is the defining 
conception we searched for above, and any other pejorative 
associations flow from that. 
This would argue that the neurologists are not agnostic after all: 
that they know a great deal about conversion, and that deception 
is the basis on which they understand it. </p>

<p>Deception as a model </p>

<p>Though psychological models were more widely endorsed, the 
continued interest in 'malingering' was striking-albeit taking 
subtle and varied forms. None of those interviewed took the 
kind of absolutist position they recognized from their training, 
the view that conversion was just malingering, that there was 
nothing wrong with them. But deception remained a pervasive 
issue, and a core diagnostic issue-either as a suspicion to be 
combated, or as a reality to be accommodated. The contention 
here is that deception is a pervasive issue because that is how at 
least some neurologists understand their patients. Such an under-
standing may not be surprising. The neurologist has no available 
neuropathological explanation. Deception of a trivial kind, in the 
form of innocuous simulation, is part of the core encounter of the 
conversion patient (Kanaan, in press): the patient presents with 
what looks at first like epilepsy or a stroke, but is not. The neu-
rologist can accept it as subconscious-and that was a possibility 
they seemed willing to accept-but assessing that was described 
as something only psychiatrists could do. Any model which would 
have discriminatory power for the neurologist would have to be 
something they could employ in their own clinical encounter. The 
neurologist who doubted conversion existed is instructive here: as 
they, uniquely, employed a psychological model in their practice, 
they did not see conversion anywhere. The clearest evidence that, </p>

<p>for others, the model employed was deception, arose from those 
instances when they brought up cases of 'malingering' as exam-
ples of 'conversion'. They often corrected or modulated that sub-
sequently, but their first thought, when reaching for a classic or 
characteristic case, was to describe deception. 
Holding to a heuristic model of deception would not imply that 
they believed conversion patients to be consciously feigning. 
Neurologists appear to accept the psychiatric orthodoxy that 
there are subconscious qualifications of apparent feigning behav-
iour that make it something else. But it could function as a 
heuristic nonetheless: the patient behaves 'as though' feigning, 
but the painful business of deciding quite how that is explained 
is someone else's problem. </p>
