<p>OBJECTIVEdPreclinical data suggest that linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, may 
lower urinary albumin excretion. The ability of linagliptin to lower albuminuria on top of renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition in humans was analyzed by pooling data from 
four similarly designed, 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trials. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdA pooled analysis of four completed studies 
identified 217 subjects with type 2 diabetes and prevalent albuminuria (defined as a urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] of 3023,000 mg/g creatinine) while receiving stable doses of 
RAAS inhibitors. Participants were randomized to either linagliptin 5 mg/day (n = 162) or 
placebo (n = 55). The primary end point was the percentage change in geometric mean UACR 
from baseline to week 24. </p>

<p>RESULTSdUACR at week 24 was reduced by 32% (95% CI 242 to 221; P , 0.05) with 
linagliptin compared with 6% (95% CI 227 to +23) with placebo, with a between-group dif-
ference of 28% (95% CI 247 to 22; P = 0.0357). The between-group difference in the change 
in HbA 1c from baseline to week 24 was 20.61% (26.7 mmol/mol) in favor of linagliptin (95% 
CI 20.88 to 20.34% [29.6 to 23.7 mmol/mol]; P , 0.0001). The albuminuria-lowering effect 
of linagliptin, however, was not influenced by race or HbA 1c and systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
values at baseline or after treatment. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdLinagliptin administered in addition to stable RAAS inhibitors led to a 
significant reduction in albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal dysfunction. This 
observation was independent of changes in glucose level or SBP. Further research to prospec-
tively investigate the renal effects of linagliptin is underway. </p>

<p>changes in glucose metabolism because 
the b-cell response to linagliptin was alle-
viated as a result of previous administration 
of streptozotocin, a b-cell toxin, to these 
mice (16). However, clinical evidence re-
garding the renal effects of incretin-based 
therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes is 
scarce (23,24), and conclusive evidence to 
translate the findings of animal models 
to humans has yet to emerge from dedi-
cated randomized clinical trials. Neverthe-
less, urinary albumin excretion, assessed 
by the albumin-to-creatinine (Cr) ratio 
(UACR), is often collected in clinical de-
velopment programs involving people 
with diabetes. Indeed, one advantage of 
the databases collected during drug de-
velopment is the opportunity to pool 
data from individual studies, which sig-
nificantly increases the available power for 
further exploratory analyses. In this study, 
we used data collected during the develop-
ment of linagliptin to test the hypothesis 
that linagliptin may reduce albuminuria 
in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal 
dysfunction. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODSdThis retrospective analy-
sis used data from the global linagliptin 
development program. It included four 
phase III clinical trials conducted between 
January 2008 and May 2010 to assess the 
safety and efficacy of linagliptin in 
patients with type 2 diabetes (25-28) 
(Supplementary Table 1). These four trials 
were all randomized, double-blind, and 
placebo-controlled with identical study 
duration, primary end point definition, 
and safety assessments, which allowed data 
to be pooled appropriately (Supplementary 
Fig. 1). The design and results of these four 
individual trials have been described pre-
viously in detail (25-28). 
In brief, patients were eligible for each 
of these four trials if they were aged 18280 
years, had type 2 diabetes, had a BMI #40 
kg/m 2 , and were either treatment-naïve 
(HbA 1c levels of 7.0211.0% [53297 
mmol/mol] at screening) or had previ-
ously received one or two oral glucose-
lowering therapies (HbA 1c levels of 
6.5210.5% [48291 mmol/mol] at screen-
ing). Eligible study participants were ran-
domized to receive either placebo or 
linagliptin 5 mg in addition to background 
therapy from their original study. The pri-
mary efficacy outcome of all four studies 
was change in HbA 1c from baseline to 
week 24. 
Safety assessments in all four studies 
were identical and predefined. Respective </p>

<p>safety results have been reported previ-
ously (25-28). Renal function assess-
ments consisted of estimated GFR (eGFR) 
as determined by the Modification of Diet 
in Renal Disease formula and estimated Cr 
clearance as determined by the Cockcroft-
Gault formula. Albuminuria was deter-
mined by UACR from a spot urine sample 
at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of 
treatment. All assessments of urine and 
blood were performed at a central labora-
tory (MDS Pharma Services Central Labo-
ratories and Covance Laboratories). 
Microalbuminuria was defined as a base-
line UACR of 302300 mg/g Cr, and mac-
roalbuminuria was defined as a baseline 
UACR of 30023,000 mg/g Cr. Stages of 
CKD were categorized based on the classi-
fication system established by the National 
Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Out-
comes Quality Initiative (1). 
Safety analyses included the fre-
quency and intensity of adverse events 
(AEs), vital signs (e.g., systolic blood 
pressure [SBP] and diastolic blood pres-
sure), clinical laboratory measures, and 
evaluation of hypoglycemia. Repeated 
blood pressure measurements were per-
formed at each study visit with the subject 
in a seated position after a minimum of 
5 min rest. </p>

<p>End points 
The primary efficacy end point of this 
pooled analysis was specified as the per-
centage change in geometric mean UACR 
from baseline to week 24. Secondary 
efficacy end points were changes in 
HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
from baseline to week 24. </p>

<p>Statistical methods 
The pooled population consisted of all 
randomized individuals (n = 2,472) 
who received at least one dose of study 
drug (treated set: placebo group, n = 679; 
linagliptin group, n = 1,793). Among this 
population, subjects were included in the 
primary pooled analysis set if they met the 
following criteria: a baseline UACR be-
tween 30 and 3,000 mg/g Cr, a baseline 
eGFR $30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and receiv-
ing stable doses of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), 
ARBs, or both for at least 4 weeks before the 
study and from baseline to the date of the 
last UACR on-treatment measurement 
within the 24-week treatment period. 
All efficacy analyses were performed 
on the full analysis set. This included 
randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of study treatment, had a base-
line measurement of the relevant end </p>

<p>point, and had at least one on-treatment 
measurement of the relevant end point. 
Missing data were handled using the last 
observation carried forward approach, 
with observations after the start of rescue 
therapy accepted as observed cases. Be-
cause of their skewed distribution, the 
UACR data were log 10 -transformed be-
fore analysis and changes from baseline 
were analyzed by ANCOVA and adjusted 
for log 10 -transformed baseline values and 
trial effect. Results of the analysis were 
back-transformed to obtain geometric 
means of the UACR ratios of the 24-week 
value to the baseline value and correspond-
ing 95% CI; the values then were expressed 
as percentage change in adjusted geometric 
mean of the UACR ratios of the 24-week 
value to the baseline value, as previously 
reported (29). The UACR results were cal-
culated for the primary pooled analysis set 
and the four individual studies. Further-
more, subgroup analyses were performed 
for the following factors: race (Asian, 
white), baseline HbA 1c (less than mean, 
more than or equal to mean), and baseline 
SBP (less than mean, more than or equal to 
mean). All subjects in the primary pooled 
analysis set received concomitant ACEIs, 
ARBs, or both. To further evaluate whether 
concomitant RAAS blockade could influ-
ence the effect of linagliptin on albumin-
uria, an additional sensitivity analysis set 
was defined to test the primary end point 
and included subjects who were not treated 
with RAAS inhibitors but who met criteria 
for UACR and eGFR at baseline. 
The changes in HbA 1c from base-
line to week 24 were assessed using 
ANCOVA, with treatment, study, and 
washout as fixed classification effects and 
baseline HbA 1c as a covariate. The same 
model with the addition of the covariate 
baseline FPG was used to assess changes 
in FPG from baseline to week 24. The re-
ductions in HbA 1c within the linagliptin 
group were stratified into quartiles based 
on the change from baseline to week 24: 
,0.1, 0.120.59, 0.6020.99, and $1.0% 
(,1.1, 1.126.5, 6.6210.8, and $10.9 
mmol/mol). Effects on SBP after treatment 
within the linagliptin group were stratified 
into three categories based on the change 
from baseline to the last value on treatment: 
SBP decrease of .1.0 mmHg, stable SBP 
with only minimal changes between 21.0 
and 11.0 mmHg, and SBP increase of 
.1.0 mmHg. The difference between per-
centage changes in geometric mean UACR 
across HbA 1c quartiles and SBP categories 
was tested using an ANOVA F-test to de-
termine whether they were statistically </p>

<p>RESULTSdPatient disposition is 
shown in Fig. 1. Of the 2,472 subjects 
who were included in the treated set of 
the four clinical studies, 564 subjects had 
albuminuria (UACR 3023,000 mg/g Cr) 
and an eGFR $30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at 
screening. Furthermore, of these 564 sub-
jects, 217 subjects were receiving stable 
doses of ACEIs and/or ARBs at baseline 
and during the 24-week treatment period 
and were used in the primary analysis set 
(Fig. 1). Of note, only seven patients were 
excluded from the analysis because of a 
UACR .3,000 mg/g Cr. The sensitivity 
analysis set included 249 subjects with 
type 2 diabetes and prevalent albuminuria 
who were not previously treated with 
RAAS inhibitors (Fig. 1). 
Baseline demographic, clinical, and 
biochemical characteristics, as well as 
concomitant background therapies, were 
balanced between the two treatment 
groups (Table 1). Overall, the majority 
of the subjects (71%) were white. Mean 
age and baseline HbA 1c of the study pop-
ulation were 60.7 6 9.6 years and 8.3 6 
0.9% (67.2 6 9.8 mmol/mol), respec-
tively, and 68% of subjects had type 2 </p>

<p>diabetes for more than 5 years. At study 
entry, most individuals had microalbumin-
uria (84%) and mild or no renal impair-
ment (88%); 68 and 35% of participants 
received ACEIs or ARBs at screening, re-
spectively, with only 3% of participants re-
ceiving dual RAAS blockade. </p>

<p>Efficacy 
Median UACR values were similar be-
tween treatment groups at baseline: 73.8 
(30.122,534.4) and 80.5 (30.921,538.2) 
mg/g Cr in the linagliptin and placebo 
groups, respectively (Table 1). After 24 
weeks of treatment, the percentage change 
in adjusted geometric mean UACR from 
baseline was significantly higher with 
linagliptin (232% [95% CI 242 to 221]; 
P , 0.05) compared with placebo (26% 
[95% CI 227 to 123]), with a between-
group difference of 228% (95% CI 247 
to 22; P = 0.0357) (Fig. 2A and B). Nota-
bly, the magnitude of the albuminuria-
lowering effect of linagliptin was already 
seen after 12 weeks of treatment (229% 
[95% CI 240 to 217]; P , 0.05; between-
group difference: 225% [95% CI 246 to 
13]; P = 0.0750) (Fig. 2A and B). 
Further subgroup analyses of the 
primary end point were performed for 
race, baseline HbA 1c , and baseline SBP. 
For each analysis, there was no statisti-
cally significant interaction between treat-
ment and the relevant subgroup. The </p>

<p>overall effect of linagliptin was consistent 
with the results from the primary analysis 
(Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. 2). 
We further explored the effect of 
linagliptin on the UACR in patients with 
renal dysfunction who were not previ-
ously treated with RAAS inhibitors. This 
sensitivity analysis showed a significant 
reduction in the UACR from baseline to 
week 24 with linagliptin (230% [95% CI 
240 to 219]; P , 0.05; n = 183). The 
between-group difference of 217% (95% 
CI 238 to 112) showed a similar trend 
as the primary analysis set but did not 
reach statistical significance (P = 0.2301; 
n = 249). 
Important potential confounding fac-
tors for the primary end point that were 
considered included improvements in 
glycemic control and alterations in blood 
pressure or renal function during the 24 
weeks of treatment in either group. As 
expected, linagliptin led to significant 
reductions in HbA 1c . Adjusted mean 
changes in HbA 1c from baseline to week 
24 were 20.66% (27.2 mmol/mol) with 
linagliptin compared with 20.05% 
(20.5 mmol/mol) with placebo (Fig. 
3A), with a between-group difference of 
20.61% (26.7 mmol/mol) in favor of 
linagliptin (95% CI 20.88 to 20.34% 
[29.6 to 23.7 mmol/mol]; P , 0.0001). 
HbA 1c also was stratified into quartiles based 
on the change from baseline to week 24. The 
percentage changes in the geometric mean 
UACR at week 24 for linagliptin across these 
categories were not statistically significantly 
different (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, significant 
results were seen in adjusted mean changes 
in FPG from baseline to week 24 (28.88 
mg/dL with linagliptin versus 116.22 mg/ 
dL with placebo; between-group difference 
225.1 mg/dL [95% CI 238.55 to 211.65]; 
P = 0.0003). 
We found no clinically meaningful 
changes in SBP from baseline to last value 
on treatment in subjects treated with 
either linagliptin or placebo (Fig. 3C). 
SBP was stratified into three categories 
based on the change from baseline to 
last value on treatment. The percentage 
changes in the geometric mean UACR at 
week 24 for linagliptin across these cate-
gories were not statistically significantly 
different (Fig. 3D). There were no rele-
vant differences between the distribu-
tion of different RAAS inhibitors at 
baseline. Moreover, changes in other blood 
pressure-lowering medications during 
the study were rare and were balanced 
overall between the two treatment groups 
(data not shown). </p>

20.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , respectively). </p>

<p>Safety 
Among participants of this pooled analy-
sis, linagliptin was safe and well tolerated. 
The overall incidence of clinical AEs was 
similar between the linagliptin and pla-
cebo groups (63.0 vs. 63.6%, respectively) 
(Supplementary Table 2). The incidence of 
AEs for renal and urinary disorders was 
similar between treatment groups (4.3 vs. 
5.5%, respectively). The proportion of 
patients experiencing drug-related AEs 
was slightly higher with linagliptin than 
with placebo (14.2 vs. 7.3%). This differ-
ence was most likely related to a higher 
incidence of drug-related hypoglycemia 
in the linagliptin group (8.6 vs. 0.0%). No-
tably, all subjects in the linagliptin group 
who experienced investigator-reported 
hypoglycemia were receiving sulfonylurea 
background therapy. No investigator-
reported hypoglycemic events were re-
ported in patients treated with linagliptin 
as monotherapy or in addition to metfor-
min. In addition, no severe hypoglycemic 
events (i.e., events requiring the assis-
tance of another person to actively admin-
ister carbohydrate, glucagon, or other 
resuscitative actions) were reported for 
any participant. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdThis pooled analy-
sis of four phase III clinical trials from the 
clinical development program has dem-
onstrated that linagliptin significantly re-
duced albuminuria from baseline by 28% 
compared with placebo after 24 weeks 
of treatment. Notably, the magnitude of 
the effect on albuminuria was already 
seen after 12 weeks of treatment. In 
addition, the albuminuria-lowering effect 
of linagliptin was consistently found in 
relevant patient subgroups, such as those 
categorized by race, baseline HbA 1c , and 
baseline SBP. This analysis suggests that 
linagliptin may have direct effects on the 
kidney in type 2 diabetes and that pro-
spective trials testing this hypothesis are 
warranted. 
Several clinical factors are well known 
to influence urinary albumin excretion in 
type 2 diabetes, such as changes in SBP or 
loss of renal function. However, we found 
no clinically meaningful changes in SBP 
and eGFR during 24 weeks of treatment 
in either group, indicating both hemo-
dynamic and renal safety of linagliptin. 
Moreover, for linagliptin, there was no 
statistically significant difference between </p>

<p>the percentage changes in geometric 
mean UACR across the categories of 
SBP for the last value on treatment. This 
indicates that blood pressure does not 
have a significant influence on the effect of 
linagliptin on the UACR in our analysis. 
In addition, changes in hyperglyce-
mia are a potentially important con-
founder. In fact, large-scale intervention 
studies have demonstrated that sustained 
improvements in glycemic control reduce 
the development and progression of 
microvascular complications in patients 
with type 2 diabetes after long-term treat-
ment (30-32). Hence, it is tempting to 
speculate that any reduction in albu-
minuria may simply mirror concomitant 
improvements in glucose control after 
short-term treatment. The evidence for a 
potential effect of relatively short-term 
glucose control (over months rather 
than years) on albuminuria in diabetes 
is, however, inconclusive. An improve-
ment in HbA 1c after 52 weeks of insulin 
infusiondfrom 9.5 to 7.3% (80.3 to 56.3 
mmol/mol)dwas not associated with any 
significant changes in renal parameters, 
such as GFR or urinary albumin excre-
tion, in patients with insulin-dependent 
diabetes and elevated urinary albumin 
excretion (30-300 mg/24 h) (33). 
Moreover, a previous study by Tuttle 
et al. (34) reported that strict glycemic 
control did lower HbA 1c levels from 
8.4 to 6.9% (68 to 52 mmol/mol) after 
3 weeks of intensive insulin therapy. 
Although renal hemodynamic responses 
to increased plasma amino acid concentra-
tions were improved, the rapid HbA 1c 
reduction did not lead to significant 
changes in urinary albumin excretion. In 
line with these findings, improvement in 
glycemic control did not improve micro-
albuminuria in an adolescent population 
with insulin-dependent diabetes using 
either intensive conventional therapy or 
insulin infusion up to 8 months (35). 
These results suggest no major influence 
of short-term glucose control on urinary 
albumin excretion. However, an exact 
timely separation between short-and 
longer-term interdependencies between 
glucose control and progression of renal 
disease in type 2 diabetes is difficult. Our 
analysis does not support a direct relation-
ship between short-term glucose control 
and changes in UACR. We found no sta-
tistically significant difference between the 
percentage changes in geometric mean 
UACR and changes in HbA 1c at week 24

<p>Albuminuria-lowering effect of linagliptin </p>

<p>similar changes in UACR compared with 
those having more profound reductions in 
HbA 1c (.1.1% [12.0 mmol/mol]) after 24 
weeks of treatment with linagliptin. 
The mechanisms by which linagliptin 
may additionally improve the effects of 
RAAS inhibitors in the kidney remain to 
be fully elucidated. The hypothesis of a 
potential albuminuria-lowering effect of 
linagliptin was first raised as a result of 
findings from an experimental animal 
study assessing the renal effects of coad-
ministration of linagliptin with telmisartan </p>

<p>in diabetic endothelial nitric oxide syn-
thase knockout mice (16). In this model 
of vascular renal damage, 11 weeks of 
combination therapy significantly reduced 
urinary albumin excretion, independent 
of changes in blood glucose, and the 
effects were greater than those seen with 
RAAS blockade alone. The available evi-
dence suggests that the albuminuria-
lowering effect of linagliptin may be due 
to inhibition of podocyte damage and myo-
fibroblast transformation (36) as well as a 
consequence of improvement in renal </p>

<p>inflammatory responses mediated by in-
creased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
activity (16,36) or inhibition of tumor 
necrosis factor-a (16). Moreover, treatment 
with linagliptin reduced plasma levels of 
osteopontin, a marker of vascular calcifi-
cation and progression of renal disease 
(16). These results are further supported 
by several other experimental studies of 
DPP-4 inhibitors showing beneficial 
effects of sitagliptin and vildagliptin on al-
buminuria and renal function in models 
of diabetic nephropathy (18-20). There is </p>

<p>also evidence from experimental research 
suggesting that treatment with GLP-1 
receptor agonists, such as exendin-4 or 
liraglutide, reduces oxidative stress and 
urinary albumin excretion possibly via 
increasing GLP-1 receptor expression 
(22) or via protein kinase A-mediated 
inhibition of renal NADPH oxidase, inde-
pendent of a glucose-lowering effect (17). 
Taken together, these preclinical findings 
raise the possibility of a renal class effect 
of DPP-4 inhibitors or even all incretin-
based therapies. However, variances in 
experimental study designs, applied drug 
concentrations, and distinct pharmacolog-
ical differences between agents, such as 
half-lives, tissue penetration, drug metabo-
lism, and drug excretion, do not allow 
simple extrapolation of the results from 
animal studies into human clinical condi-
tions and among compounds. 
To date, the clinical renal evidence of 
incretin-based therapies in patients with 
type 2 diabetes is scarce. A recent ran-
domized, double-blind, parallel-group 
study compared sitagliptin with the 
sulfonylurea glipizide over 54 weeks in 
patients with type 2 diabetes and moder-
ate to severe renal impairment (23). 
Despite a significant improvement in 
HbA 1c from baseline (by 20.8% [28.7 
mmol/mol]) at the end of the study, 
sitagliptin was associated with an increase 
in UACR from baseline by 118 and 16% 
after 24 and 54 weeks of treatment, re-
spectively (23). In another study using 
an injectable GLP-1 analog, Ryuge et al. 
(24) found that liraglutide was not 
associated with any changes in renal 
function or albuminuria after 24 weeks 
of treatment in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy. However, these data must 
be interpreted with caution because both 
studies provide observational assess-
ments of renal parameters and were not 
designed specifically to assess changes in 
albuminuria (23,24). Prospective, ran-
domized, controlled clinical trials are 
now needed to assess the renal effects 
of incretin-based therapies in patients 
with type 2 diabetes. The recently initi-
ated MARLINA (Efficacy, Safety &amp; Modi-
fication of Albuminuria in Type 2 
Diabetes Subjects with Renal Disease 
with LINAgliptin) trial (NCT01792518) 
is specifically designed to assess the 
albuminuria-lowering potential of 
linagliptin. Further evidence for the renal 
effects of linagliptin is expected to emerge 
from the CAROLINA (CARdiovascular 
Outcome Study of LINAgliptin Versus 
Glimepiride in Patients with Type 2 </p>

<p>Diabetes) trial (NCT01243424). This 
study aims to evaluate the long-term effect 
of linagliptin on CV morbidity and 
mortality in direct comparison with the 
sulfonylurea glimepiride and will provide 
important insights into CV outcomes inde-
pendent of any expected differences in glu-
cose control (37). Furthermore, this trial 
also will allow investigators to compare 
progression of renal disease, including 
changes in albuminuria and/or eGFR, 
over time. Notably, markers of renal damage, 
such as renal impairment and/or prevalent 
albuminuria, are some of the predefined 
inclusion criteria in the CAROLINA trial. 
The CARMELINA (CArdiovascular Safety 
&amp; Renal Microvascular OutcomE Study 
with LINAgliptin) trial (NCT01897532) 
was also recently initiated. This study 
will enroll more than 8,000 subjects 
with type 2 diabetes and renal dysfunc-
tion and aims to investigate the efficacy 
and safety of linagliptin versus placebo 
on both CV and renal microvascular 
outcomes. 
Because of the retrospective and 
pooled nature of our analysis, some 
methodological limitations need to be 
considered. Although pooling data from 
studies allows investigators to test the 
primary hypothesis using an adequately 
sized population, our analysis relates to 
clinical trials that were not primarily 
designed to investigate the change in 
UACR. For this reason, results of this 
study should be interpreted primarily 
for generating a hypothesis. In addition, 
most patients included in the primary 
pooled analysis set were treated with mul-
tiple antihypertensive agents, and differ-
ences beyond stable RAAS inhibition in 
the background treatment may have con-
founded our results. However, antihyper-
tensive therapies at screening were well 
balanced between the two treatment 
groups, and patients who required adjust-
ments to doses of RAAS inhibitors were 
excluded from the primary pooled analysis 
set. Furthermore, changes in albumin-
uria did not occur concomitantly with 
any changes in blood pressure, indicat-
ing no relevant influence of the back-
ground antihypertensive treatment on 
the albuminuria-lowering effect of 
linagliptin. Another limitation is that UACR 
assessments were based on a single urine 
specimen; this may have reduced the 
precision of the results because urinary 
albumin excretion shows considerable intra-
individual variability. However, urinary 
albumin was assessed at three independent 
time points (baseline and 12 and 24 </p>

<p>weeks), and assays were performed in 
a central laboratory to minimize vari-
ability. Moreover, the results of this 
pooled analysis are restricted to the pop-
ulation of patients with type 2 diabetes 
and prevalent albuminuria in the range of 
UACR 3023,000 mg/g Cr who were re-
ceiving stable doses of RAAS inhibitors. 
Therefore, these results cannot be extrap-
olated to all subjects with type 2 diabetes 
and kidney disease. Finally, although 
proteinuria/albuminuria is a predictor 
of increased CV risk in diabetes, it has 
been associated with only significant 
progression of decline in renal function 
and overall risk of ESRD in patients with 
type 2 diabetes at the overt proteinuric/ 
albuminuric stage (38). Prevention of 
new-onset albuminuria, however, did 
not result in reduced risk for CKD in 
diabetes (39,40). Therefore, this analysis 
cannot provide conclusive evidence for 
improved long-term renal outcomes with 
linagliptin. 
In summary, this pooled analysis 
found that linagliptin, administered in 
addition to stable ACEI or ARB therapy, 
led to a significant reduction in albumin-
uria after 24 weeks of treatment. Our data 
support a novel hypothesis that sug-
gests an additive albuminuria-lowering 
effect with dual blockade of the RAAS 
and DPP-4 system. To substantiate these 
hypothesis-generating findings, further 
prospective clinical research has been 
initiated. Such efforts will address an 
important unmet medical need among 
patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney 
disease. </p>
