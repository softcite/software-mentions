<p>Abstract. Metadherin (MTDH) can be recruited to mature 
tight junction complexes, and it regulates mesenchymal 
marker protein expression in many tumors and promote cancer 
metastasis. This study investigated the influence of MTDH 
expression on gastric cancer and to elucidate the potential 
mechanisms by which MTDH regulates actin cytoskeletal 
remodeling and enhances human gastric cancer metastasis via 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Relative MTDH 
mRNA expression levels were assessed by quantitative real-
time PCR (Q-PCR), and MTDH protein expression levels and 
localization were evaluated via immunohistochemical (ICH) 
staining. We studied the role of MTDH in cancer cell migration 
and invasion by modulating MTDH expression in the gastric 
cancer cell lines MKN45 and AGS. We also confirmed the 
functions of MTDH through in vivo experiments. We found 
that MTDH expression levels were correlated with lymph 
node metastasis, TNM stages and decreased OS (P=0.002, 
&lt;0.001 and 0.010, respectively) in human gastric cancer and 
that MTDH upregulation promoted EMT in vitro. Consistent </p>

<p>with this finding, MTDH downregulation inhibited cell migra-
tion and invasion in vitro and suppressed tumor growth and 
metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, MTDH knockdown regulated 
actin cytoskeletal remodeling and inhibited EMT. Overall, our 
results provide a novel role for MTDH in regulating gastric 
cancer metastasis. </p>

<p>Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy and the 
third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (1). It was 
estimated that a total of 952,000 new cases of gastric cancer 
were diagnosed in 2012 and that 723,000 gastric cancer-related 
deaths occurred during the same year (2). Despite advances in 
surgical techniques and chemotherapies, metastasis remains 
the main obstacle to effective gastric cancer treatment (3,4). 
Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers for gastric 
cancer metastasis may facilitate the development of targeted 
therapies useful for the treatment of gastric cancer. 
Metadherin (MTDH), also known as astrocyte elevated 
gene-1 (AEG-1) and lysine-rich CEACAM-1-associated 
protein (LYRIC), was initially identified as an oncogene. Its 
expression was induced in primary human fetal astrocytes 
by HIV-1 or treatment with HIV envelope glycoproteins or 
tumor necrosis factor-α (5-7). In recent years, studies have 
shown that MTDH expression levels were elevated in many 
human malignancies, including breast cancer, hepatocellular 
carcinoma, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, and esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (8-11). Moreover, MTDH has been 
reported to play a vital role in tumorigenesis, tumor progres-
sion and chemotherapy resistance (12,13). A recent study (14) 
suggested that modulating the AEG-1/EMT pathway may 
inhibit hepatocarcinoma growth and metastasis. However, few 
studies have addressed whether MTDH expression levels are 
upregulated in gastric cancer and whether the protein partici-
pates in gastric cancer metastasis. 
Britt et al (6) found that MTDH was mainly localized 
in the cytoplasm and that the protein could be recruited to 
tight junction complexes to serve as a marker for mature tight 
junctions. It is well known that tight junctions are specific </p>

<p>junctional complexes that participate in cell-cell adhesion, 
which plays a key role in preserving cell morphology. 
The cytoskeleton preserves cellular structure. Several 
studies (15,16) have demonstrated that protein-protein inter-
actions in tight junction complexes are probably related to 
actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and tight junction disruption 
may cause the cytoskeletons of epithelial cells to transform 
into cytoskeletons characteristic of mesenchymal cells, 
leading to cell metastasis. 
It has been hypothesized (17) that tumor cell metastasis 
occurs via the following steps: invasion in situ, intravasation, 
survival in circulation, extravasation, micrometastasis and 
final colonization. EMT is the process in which epithelial cells 
with polarity transform into freely moving mesenchymal cells 
under specific physiological and pathological conditions and is 
the most important step in the induction of tumor cell invasion 
and metastasis in situ (18). 
Moreover, EMT was associated with altered gene expres-
sion patterns resulting in the loss of E-cadherin and the 
breakdown of cell-cell junctions as well as the acquisition 
of a fibroblastic morphology including polarized actin cyto-
skeleton assembly into protrusive and invasive pseudopodial 
structures (19). Pseudopodial protrusion and formation of 
related invadopodia have long been associated with tumor cell 
migration and invasion (20,21). 
Therefore, we surmised that MTDH can regulate cyto-
skeletal remodeling, induce EMT and promote cancer cell 
metastasis. We investigated the significance of MTDH in 
gastric cancer, as well as explored the mechanism underlying 
actin cytoskeletal remodeling and EMT-mediated gastric 
cancer metastasis. </p>

<p>Materials and methods </p>

<p>Clinical samples. All experiments involving patients were 
approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Ninth People's 
Hospital. This study was conducted on 83 paraffin-embedded 
primary gastric cancer samples and 25 normal gastric mucosa 
samples whose diagnoses were determined histopathologically 
and clinically at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, School of 
Medicine between January 2009 and December 2011. None of 
the patients from whom the samples were originally obtained 
had undergone any preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 
The patients in question were followed up until May 2016. A 
total of eleven patients (13.2% of patients) were lost to follow-
up. In addition, mRNA expression levels were assessed in fresh 
tumor specimens from an additional 31 patients with histo-
logical diagnoses of primary gastric carcinoma who underwent 
surgical resection. All the patients had previously consented to 
the use of the above clinical samples for research purposes. </p>

<p>Ethics approval and consent to participate. This study was 
approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Ninth People's 
Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
Preoperative informed consent was obtained from each patient 
enrolled in this study, in accordance with institutional guide-
lines. The pathological samples were taken from surgically 
resected specimens; thus, the corresponding experiments 
did not pose any risks to the health or prognoses of the 
patients enrolled herein. We are committed to maintaining </p>

<p>the confidentiality of the patient information. Furthermore, 
the laboratory animals used in the study were cared for and 
handled in accordance with the principles and standards set 
forth in the Principles for the Use of Animals (National Guide 
for Grants and Contracts). </p>

<p>Cell lines and cell culture. The gastric cancer cell lines AGS, 
KATO-III, SGC7901, and MKN45 and the normal gastric 
mucosa cell line GES-1 were purchased from American 
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The 
SGC7901, AGS, and MKN45 cell lines were cultured in RPMI-
1640 (Gibco) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (Gibco), the KATO-III cell line was cultured in IMDM 
(ATCC) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, and the 
GES-1 cell line was cultured in DMEM (ATCC) supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum, according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. All the cell lines were incubated in a humidified 
atmosphere at 37˚C with 5% CO 2 . </p>

<p>Histology and immunohistochemistry. Serial 4-µm-thick 
tissue sections were cut, deparaffinized, rehydrated and 
then heated for 30 min in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen 
retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by 3% 
hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The sections were then blocked 
with 5% normal blocking serum before being incubated with 
an MTDH mAb (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight. 
The following day, the sections were incubated with biotin-
conjugated anti-IgG serum (Boster, Wuhan, China) for 40 min 
before being incubated with an SABC solution, according to 
the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antibodies were 
visualized over a 10-min period using a diaminobenzidine 
tetrachloride kit (Boster). The sections were subsequently 
observed under a light microscope. In addition, all the sections 
were independently assessed and scored by two pathologists 
blinded to each patient's status, and the staining results were 
assessed as described in our previous study (22). The cell 
staining percentage scores (0 point = 0-5%; 1 point = 6-25%; 
2 points = 26-50%; and 3 points = &gt;50%) and staining inten-
sity scores (0 point = negative; 1 point = weak intensity; 
2 points = moderate intensity; and 3 points = strong intensity) 
were subsequently summed to determine the total staining 
scores for each section. Staining scores ≥3 points were indica-
tive of positive staining, while staining scores &lt;3 points were 
indicative of negative staining (23). </p>

<p>Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). Total RNA was 
extracted from gastric cancer cells using TRIzol reagent 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manu-
facturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed with 
a RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Takara), 
and then Q-PCR was performed using TaqMan assays and 
a QuantiTect SYBR Green kit (Biotool, Houston, TX, USA). 
Relative mRNA expression levels were determined using the 
comparative Ct-method after being normalized to GADPH 
expression levels. The expression levels of each gene were 
analyzed in triplicate. See Table I for the sequences of the 
primers used for this experiment. </p>

<p>Western blot assay. The cells were lysed with radioimmuno-
precipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer supplemented with </p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 51: 63-74, 2017 </p>



<p>RIPA 10 µl/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a 
protease inhibitor, and protein concentrations were deter-
mined by a Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein assay kit. All 
of these reagents were purchased from the Beyotime Institute 
of Biotechnology, China. Equal amounts of protein were sepa-
rated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes 
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), which were blocked with 5% 
non-fat milk for 2 h before being incubated with the appropriate 
primary antibodies overnight at 4˚C. The membranes were 
subsequently incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The protein 
bands were visualized by an Enhanced Chemiluminescence 
Detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 
photographed by a Gel Logic 2200 PRO imaging system. 
The following primary antibodies were used in this experi-
ment: an MTDH rabbit mAb (1:2000, Abcam), an E-cadherin 
rabbit mAb (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, 
USA), a Slug rabbit mAb (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), 
a Snail rabbit pAb (1:1000, Abcam), an N-cadherin mouse 
mAb (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), a zO-1 mouse mAb 
(1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology), and a GAPDH mAb-HRP 
(1:5000, Bioworld Technology, Minneapolis, MN, USA). </p>

<p>siRNA interference and stable knockdown cell line establish-
ment. Four siRNA sequences targeting human MTDH mRNA 
were designed using RNAi designer (<rs id="software-1" type="software">Oligo</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">6.0</rs> software). A 
scrambled sequence of targeting MTDH sequences was used 
as a negative control. The control siRNA (MTDH-con si) 
targeting sequence was 5'-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACG 
UTT-3', the MTDH-siRNA#1 (si#1) targeting sequence was 
5'-GCUGUUCGAACACCUCAAATT-3', the MTDH-
siRNA#2 (si#2) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCGUAAUCA 
ACCCUAUAUTT-3' , and the MTDH-siRNA#3 (si#3) targeting 
sequence was 5'-GCCAUCUGUAAUCUUAUCATT-3'. The </p>

<p>most effective siRNA sequence was selected, after which a 
hairpin structure (shRNA) was added to it. A recombinant lenti-
virus containing the corresponding MTDH-shRNA construct 
was subsequently produced via co-transfection of 293T cells 
with helper plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2G) with Lipofier 
(HanBio, Shanghai, China). After 48 h of transfection, the 
cultured supernatant was harvested, filtered and concentrated by 
ultra centrifugation. To establish stable MTDH-knockdown cell 
lines, we transduced the MKN45 and AGS cell lines with lenti-
viral RNAi vectors. After 72 h, the cells were treated with 
2 µg/ml puromycin. The puromycin-resistant clones were 
selected and expanded for subsequent experiments. </p>

<p>Cell scratch-wound healing assay. The scratch-wound healing 
assay is one of the oldest methods for directly assessing cell 
migration ability in vitro (18). The cells were seeded in 6-well 
plates and cultured in serum-free medium until they reached 
80-90% confluency. The resultant cell monolayers were wounded 
by 10-µl plastic tips, which were used to produce straight lines 
in the monolayers. To monitor the wound healing process, we 
took photographs every 12 h using an Eclipse TS100/100-F 
inverted research microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). </p>

<p>Transwell migration and invasion assays. Migration assay was 
conducted using 24-well transwell plates with pore sizes of 
8 µm (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). The upper chambers 
of these plates were not coated with BD Matrigel™ Matrix 
Basement Membrane (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, 
USA). However, BD Matrigel™ Matrix Basement Membrane 
was used for invasion assay. The upper chamber was filed with 
2x10 5 cells suspended in 200 µl of serum-free medium, and 
the lower chamber was filed with 600 µl of medium containing 
20% fetal bovine serum, which served as a chemoattractant. 
After 24 and 48 h of incubation, the migrating and invading 
cells, respectively, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 
stained with 0.05% crystal violet (Beyotime). The numbers of 
migrating cells and invading cells were subsequently counted 
under a microscope (22). </p>

<p>Animals. Six-week-old male nude athymic BALB/c mice were 
used to evaluate tumorigenicity. For the proliferation experi-
ment, we subcutaneously injected 1x10 6 cells in 200 µl of PBS 
that had been stably transfected with MTDH-knockdown or 
empty vectors into the left flanks of the nude mice. Mouse 
tumor volumes and tumor weights were measured after 
4 weeks. Tumor volumes were measured using the following 
formula: volume = (short diameter) 2 x (long diameter)/2 (24). 
For the metastasis experiment, we injected 1x10 6 cells in 
200 µl of PBS that had been stably transfected with MTDH-
knockdown or empty vectors into the lateral tail veins of 
nude mice. These mice were sacrificed 4 weeks later, after 
which their lungs were removed, and the number of metastatic 
nodules in the lungs were counted. The lungs were then fixed 
in 4% formaldehyde for additional examination. The assays 
were performed using four nude mice per group, and all 
animal experiments were conducted in strict accordance with 
institutional guidelines. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>MTDH expression is upregulated in gastric cancer and 
is correlated with gastric cancer cell metastatic ability. 
Among 31 pairs of gastric cancer tissues and adjacent normal 
gastric mucosa tissues, 27 gastric cancer tissues were found 
to have increased MTDH mRNA expression, and 4 gastric 
cancer tissues were found to have decreased MTDH mRNA 
expression after the mRNA expression levels of MTDH in 
these tissues were normalized to the basal mRNA expres-
sion levels of MTDH in adjacent normal gastric mucosa 
tissues (Fig. 1A). The mean relative mRNA expression level 
of MTDH was 1.960±0.770 in all pairs. The MTDH mRNA 
expression level in the 22 samples without lymph node metas-
tasis (N0 stage) was lower than the mean mRNA expression </p>

<p>level in the 9 samples with lymph node metastasis (Nn stage) 
(P= 0.023; Fig. 1B). 
To determine the correlation between MTDH expression 
and gastric cancer progression, we performed immunohisto-
chemical (IHC) analysis to detect MTDH expression in 
83 primary gastric cancer samples with or without lymph node 
or vascular metastasis and 25 normal gastric mucosa samples. 
MTDH expression was almost non-existent in the normal 
gastric mucosa tissue samples. The mean MTDH expression 
was 38.89±3.123% in the 19 gastric cancer tissues without 
metastasis and 66.10±3.552% in the 64 gastric cancer tissues 
with lymph node or vascular metastasis, a difference that was 
statistically significant (P&lt;0.001; Fig. 1D). The abovemen-
tioned 83 gastric cancer tissue samples were subsequently 
divided into the following two groups: a low MTDH expres-
sion group, which included 27 tissues, and a high MTDH 
expression group, which included 56 tissues. As shown in 
Table II, MTDH expression levels were significantly corre-
lated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stages (P=0.002 
and P&lt;0.001, respectively). The median overall survival (OS) 
time in the above-mentioned 83 cases was 44 months, and 
the median OS times in the low and high MTDH expression 
groups were 51 and 36 months, respectively. High MTDH </p>

<p>protein expression was significantly associated with decreased 
OS (P=0.0098; Fig. 1E). </p>

<p>MTDH expression in gastric cancer cell lines and stable 
shMTDH gastric cancer cells. MTDH mRNA and protein 
expression levels in four gastric cancer cell lines (MKN45, 
AGS, SGC7901, and KATO-III) and a normal gastric mucosa 
cell line (GES-1) were examined by qPCR and western blotting, 
respectively (Fig. 2A and B). We found that MTDH mRNA and 
protein expression levels were low in GES-1 and KATO-III cells 
and high in AGS and MKN45 cells. According to ATCC and 
the results of our previous study (23), MKN45 and AGS cells 
were highly invasive, but KATO-III cells were poorly invasive, 
suggesting that MTDH expression levels are correlated with </p>

<p>gastric cancer cell metastasis. Moreover, both the MKN45 and 
the AGS cell lines, especially the MKN45 cell line, displayed 
easily observable morphological changes, such as migration-
related protrusions. Therefore, the MKN45 and AGS cell lines 
were selected to establish stable shMTDH cells, which were 
used in subsequent experiments. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, 
MTDH-siRNA3 (si#3) displayed maximal knockdown effi-
ciency, making it the ideal siRNA to which a hairpin structure 
could be added, as well as the ideal siRNA with which stable 
shMTDH-MKN45 (MKN45-sh#3) and shMTDH-AGS cell 
lines (AGS-sh#3) could be established (Fig. 2E and F). </p>

<p>investigate the invasion and the migration ability of different 
gastric cancer cells, we conducted scratch-wound healing and 
transwell assays. As shown in Fig. 3A, in the scratch-wound 
healing assay, the migratory range of the MKN45 cells was 
decreased after MTDH expression levels were downregulated. 
Consistent with this finding, scratch-wound coverage was 
significantly decreased in this cell line at 48 h post-wound 
placement (P= 0.010; Fig. 3B). Similar results were observed 
in the experiments involving the AGS cells (P= 0.004; Fig. 3B 
and C). 
In the Transwell assay (Fig. 3D), the number of siMTDH-
MKN45 cells that invaded the Matrigel was significantly 
reduced after 48 h compared with the numbers of normal and 
negative control cells that invaded the Matrigel after the same 
period of time (P=0.005). Moreover, the number of siMTDH-
MKN45 cells that migrated through the chamber after 24 h 
was also decreased compared with the number of normal 
and negative control cells that migrated through the chamber 
after the same period of time (P=0.008). Similar results were 
observed in the experiments involving the AGS cell line 
(P=0.021 and P=0.034, respectively; Fig. 3E). </p>

<p>Early cell migration was observed via light microscopy 
at 12 h after scratch-wound placement. As shown in Fig. 3F, 
both MKN45 and AGS control cells appeared to be distorted 
and elongated as they moved toward the scratch-wound area 
and pseudopodial protrusions were observed in these cells. 
However, the forward-most siMTDH cells exhibited an 
epithelial-like polygonal appearance, with less pseudopodial 
protrusions. As shown in Fig. 3G, both the MKN45 and the 
AGS cells appeared smooth and displayed decreased number 
of migration-related protrusions after MTDH downregulation. </p>

<p>Downregulating MTDH expression inhibits EMT in vitro. 
To confirm the existence of a relationship between MTDH 
expression levels and gastric cancer cell metastasis, we evalu-
ated the changes in EMT marker expression levels. We found 
that the mRNA expression levels of the epithelial markers 
E-cadherin and ZO-1 were significantly increased in MKN45 
cells after MTDH downregulation (P= 0.010 and P= 0.005, 
respectively; Fig. 4A). In contrast, the mRNA expression levels 
of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and the EMT-induced 
factors Slug and Snail were significantly inhibited after MTDH </p>

<p>down regulation (P=0.004, P=0.014, and P=0.017, respectively; 
Fig. 4A). Moreover, western blotting revealed that E-cadherin 
and zO-1 protein expression levels increased, whereas 
N-cadherin, Slug, and Snail protein expression levels decreased 
after MTDH expression levels were downregulated (Fig. 4B). 
Similar results were observed in the AGS cell line, as 
E-cadherin expression levels were increased, and N-cadherin 
expression levels were decreased at both the mRNA and the 
protein level when MTDH expression levels were down-
regulated (Fig. 4C and D). Taken together, the above cell 
morphology and cell functional experimental results demon-
strated that MTDH regulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling 
and promotes cell metastasis via EMT. </p>

<p>MTDH promotes EMT via actin cytoskeletal remodeling 
in vitro. To confirm that MTDH promotes EMT via actin 
cytoskeletal remodeling in gastric cancer cells, we stimulated 
MKN45 and AGS cells with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), a well-
known EMT inducer, to actively induce EMT. As shown in 
Fig. 5A and B, the migratory range of the siMTDH cell line </p>

<p>decreased when MTDH expression was downregulated. We 
subsequently stimulated both control cells and siMTDH cells 
with TGF-β1 for 24 h and found that the migratory range of 
the siMTDH cell line increased. Similar results were noted in 
the experiments involving the control cell line. We also found 
that migratory range of the siMTDH cell line increased to a 
lesser extent than that of the control cell line after TGF-β1 
stimulation. These results indicated that MTDH plays an 
important role in EMT. 
As shown in Fig. 5C, our studies of MKN45 cell morphology 
revealed that siMTDH cells displayed decreased numbers of 
migration-related protrusions compared with control cells. 
Moreover, these cells exhibited a polygonal, smooth-edge 
epithelial cell-like structure. After being stimulated with 
TGF-β1 for 24 h, the above cells displayed increased numbers 
of migration-related protrusions, changes similar to those 
displayed by control cells stimulated with TGF-β1; however, 
the control cell line displayed more migration-related protru-
sions than the siMTDH cell line. These results indicated that 
MTDH regulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling. </p>

<p>To observe the above effects at the protein level, we 
performed western blot analysis to assess changes in EMT 
marker protein expression levels (Fig. 5D). We found that the 
changes of EMT marker expression levels were similar to 
the results of Fig. 5A and C. Thus, we concluded that MTDH 
promoted EMT via actin cytoskeletal remodeling in gastric 
cancer cells. </p>

<p>MTDH promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo. 
To determine whether MTDH affects tumor formation and 
growth in vivo, we subcutaneously injected the established 
stable gastric cancer MKN45-sh#3 cells (Fig. 2E), and the 
MKN45-con sh negative control cells into the left flanks 
of BALB/c mice and assessed tumor growth after 4 weeks 
(Fig. 6A). We measured the maximum and minimum 
diameters of the resultant tumors and determined that the 
mean tumor volume was 223 mm 3 in the shMTDH group 
and 1385 mm 3 in the control group (P&lt;0.001; Fig. 6B). 
Additionally, the average tumor weight was 238 g in the 
shMTDH group and 528.6 g in the control group (P&lt;0.001; 
Fig. 6B). 
To determine whether downregulating MTDH expression 
inhibits cancer cell metastasis in vivo, we injected MKN45 
cells from the control and shMTDH groups into the tail veins 
of nude mice. After 4 weeks, the mice were euthanized, their 
lungs were dissected, and the numbers of metastatic nodules in </p>

<p>each lung were counted (Fig. 6C). The mean number of palpable 
nodules on the surface of the lung in the shMTDH group was 
12.667±2.517, and the mean number of palpable nodules on 
the surface of the lung in the control group was 7.667±1.528 
(P= 0.043; Fig. 6C). As shown in Fig. 6D, the metastatic tumor 
nodules were identified histologically via H&amp;E staining. The 
images in the top panel represent panoramic scans of lung 
tissue slices, and the images in the bottom panel are enlarged 
versions of the scans. We found that lungs in the shMTDH 
group displayed fewer cell clumps adjacent to their pulmonary 
vessels than the lungs in the control group. Additionally, 
E-cadherin expression levels were increased, and N-cadherin 
expression levels were decreased in the metastatic nodules of 
the shMTDH group compared with those in the control group 
(Fig. 6E and F), the results are consistent with those of our 
in vitro experiments. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>The results of studies aiming to identify novel targets for 
the treatment and prevention of gastric cancer metastasis are 
promising. This study demonstrated that MTDH played a 
significant role in gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. 
MTDH expression levels were elevated in gastric cancer 
tissues compared with adjacent normal gastric mucosal 
tissues, and MTDH expression levels were significantly 
increased in metastatic gastric cancer tissues compared with 
non-metastatic gastric cancer tissues. The OS time for patients 
with gastric cancer with high MTDH expression levels was 
shorter than the OS time for patients with gastric cancer with 
low MTDH expression levels. These results suggested that 
MTDH expression levels were correlated with clinical metas-
tasis and patient survival. We also found that suppressing 
MTDH expression could inhibit gastric cancer cell migration 
and invasion ability in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we 
demonstrated that MTDH expression can regulate cytoskel-
etal remodeling and is strongly correlated with changes in 
EMT marker (E-cadherin, zO-1, Slug, Snail, and N-cadherin) 
expression. MTDH downregulation decreased cell migratory 
protrusions and inhibit EMT process in both MKN45 cells 
and AGS cells. Thus, our study not only elucidated the role of 
MTDH in gastric cancer but also at least partially elucidated 
the mechanism through which MTDH facilitates gastric 
cancer metastasis. 
MTDH was first identified as a novel protein known 
as LYRIC, a known cell adhesion molecule and tumor 
suppressor (25,26). Britt et al (6) found that LYRIC was colo-
calized with the tight junction proteins zO-1 and occludin 
in polarized epithelial cells and showed that LYRIC can be 
recruited during tight junction complex maturation. Other 
studies (27-29) demonstrated that tight junction proteins, such 
as claudin-1, occludin, and zO-1, can act as tumor suppres-
sors. In the event of tight junction complex disruption (which 
is associated with decrease in zO-1 and claudin-1 expres-
sion), MTDH dissociates from the cell adhesion protein 
complex, resulting in actin cytoskeletal remodeling and EMT 
induction. In this study, we found MTDH promotes gastric 
cancer cell metastasis. When we downregulated MTDH 
expression in MKN45 and AGS cells, the cells displayed 
decreased number of migration-related protrusions, and the </p>

<p>EMT course was inhibited. Our study first demonstrated that 
MTDH promotes gastric cancer metastasis through actin 
cytoskeletal remodeling. 
During EMT, cells undergo morphological changes 
through which they lose their polarity, assume a mesen-
chymal cell-like spindle shape and develop migratory 
protrusions. Moreover, cells undergo changes in the expres-
sion levels of their differentiation markers, resulting in a 
shift from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, and 
functional changes leading to extracellular matrix (ECM) 
invasion (30-32). Disrupting cell-cell adhesion induced cell 
polarity loss and cytoskeletal remodeling, during which 
cells lost their polygonal epithelial cell-like features and 
developed mesenchymal cell-like features (33,34). We 
also demonstrated that both MKN45 cells and AGS cells 
transformed from elongated spindle-shaped cells with 
migratory protrusions into nearly polygonal, smooth-edged, 
and epithelial-like cells upon MTDH downregulation. A 
well-known EMT inducer (35), TGF-β1 promoted EMT in 
MKN45 and AGS cells and induced comparable changes 
in cell morphology and EMT marker protein expression in 
the MKN45 and AGS siMTDH cell lines. Taken together, 
these data show that MTDH upregulation regulates actin 
cytoskeletal remodeling and induces EMT in gastric cancer 
cell metastasis. Likewise, many studies (19,36,37) reported 
that pseudopodial protrusion and formation of related inva-
dopodia have long been associated with tumor cell migration 
and invasion, and dynamic actin cytoskeleton remodeling was 
closely related to EMT. However, although our study indi-
cated that downregulating MTDH expression could induce 
actin cytoskeleton remodeling and inhibit EMT in MKN45 
cells and AGS cells, we thought it was unable to completely 
block EMT. EMT could be regulated by many pathway, such 
as Wnt signaling, cytokine signaling, Notch signaling (38). 
Emdad et al (39) reported that MTDH promoted tumor inva-
sion and metastasis by activating the nuclear factor kappaB 
pathway. Hu et al (40) showed that MTDH may promote 
breast cancer metastasis by facilitating interactions between 
a lung-homing domain and an unknown receptor located on 
the surface of endothelial cells, as well as NF-κB signaling 
pathway activation. Hence, MTDH can promote cancer cell 
metastasis through many different processes warranting 
further investigation. 
However, MTDH is correlated not only with tumor metas-
tasis but also with tumorigenesis, cancer cell proliferation, 
autophagy, and chemical drug resistance (8,41-44). Liu et al (45) 
demonstrated that AEG-1/MTDH promoted neuroblastoma cell 
proliferation and that AEG-1 knockdown could enhance the 
chemosensitivity of the above tumors to cisplatin and doxoru-
bicin. In our animal experiment, we also found that both tumor 
volume and tumor weight in shMTDH mice were significantly 
decreased compared with those in control mice. Moreover, 
Li et al and Shen et al (46,47) showed that MTDH can promote 
tumor proliferation in gastric cancer. 
Taken together, our findings show that MTDH regulated 
actin cytoskeletal remodeling and enhanced EMT in gastric 
cancer metastasis. Moreover, our findings indicate that 
MTDH is a crucial factor for predicting tumor metastasis and 
prognosis. Therefore, MTDH may be a target for the efficient 
treatment of gastric cancer metastasis. </p>
